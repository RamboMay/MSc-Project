they do to !

let 's go .

i 'm kidding . you know how sometimes you just become this `` persona '' ? and you do n't know how to quit ?

what good stuff ?

i was ?

how do you get your hair to look like that ?

you 're sweet .

unsolved mystery . she used to be really popular when she started high school , then it was just like she got sick of it or something .

the thing is , cameron -- i 'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser . my sister . i ca n't date until she does .

great

it 's more

patrick -- is that- a .

what ? to completely damage me ? to send me to therapy forever ? what ?

so did you

that 's not

no . you did n't ! if you really thought i could make my own decisions , you would 've let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage .

why did n't you tell me ?

now i do . back then , was a different story .

joey never told you we went out , did he ?

can we go now ?

if kat 's not going , you 're not going .

if you must know , we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends .

best case scenario , you 're back on the payroll for awhile .

it 's a lung cancer issue

this is it . a golden opportunity . patrick can ask katarina to the party .

bianca stratford . sophomore . do n't even think about it

that girl -- i --

so -- which dakota you from ?

so they tell me ...

she just needs time to cool off i 'll give it a day .

it 's off . the whole thing .

cameron , i 'm a little busy

the vintage look is over , kat . have n't you been reading your sassy ?

get her to act like a human

do what ?

forget her sister , then .

a hundred bucks a date .

i hear you 're helpin ' verona .

william - he asked me to meet him here .

have you seen him ?

you ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective . we 're making a statement .

if i was bianca , it would be , `` any school you want , precious . do n't forget your tiara . ''

william would never have gone to a state school .

the people at this school are so incredibly foul .

an attempted slit .

really ? what was it like ? a down payment now , then a bonus for sleeping with me ?

wait i ...

oh huh

how 'd you get a tux at the last minute ?

you tell me .

no what ?

no .

acting the way we do .

bianca

then why 'd you ask ?

hey man . . . you don ' t think i can be `` cool '' ? you do n't think i can be `` laid back '' like everyone else ?

because then i 'd have to start taking out girls who like me .

you 're not okay .

you know who the raincoats are ?

hi

seven-thirty ?

i do n't really think you warrant that strong an emotion .

bianca did what ?

because you 're making decisions for me .

i know .

hey there . tired of breathing ?

sweet love , renew thy force !

no - i 've got a sweet-payin ' job that i 'm about to lose .

what just happened ?

in the microwave .

we should have seen land .

excellency , you are right .

what is it , now ? tell me ...

how could i be ? the mainland has been found . exactly as i said it would .

don alonso de bobadilla .

do you swear on all the holy saints in heaven ?

you promise ? do you swear on st. christopher ... ?

what do you see ?

all i have to do is call the guards .

ask him if he will help .

thousands .

island . far .

say not here ! cuba !

i have to disagree .

my son , my son ... your certitudes are sometimes frightening ... christopher , you must speak to them . and if you do n't i will .

may god forgive you ... ! you must tell them ! you must tell your men !

two minutes ... and already you 're a dead man . do n't let passion overwhelm you , colon .

how can you be so certain ?

ignorance ! i believe the indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the canary islands .

you show no inclination to speak otherwise !

what did they say about granada before today ?

you 'll be held in detention , deprived of your privileges and possessions . until you are returned to spain where you will be judged . have you anything to say ?

savagery is what monkeys understand .

in one act of brutality , you have created chaos . tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us ! all that because of your criminal savagery !

god be with us admiral .

the land is there . i know it !

immediately .

he must be replaced .

yes . it would be a pity , would n't it ? call him back !

is that the man i knew , treasurer sanchez ?

give me another one , please .

look , i have n't really focused on that kind of thing .

no , he is here . shit ...

you bring the cigarettes ?

what are you doing ?

if i was your boyfriend , i might be .

what about back home ?

well , i 'm the deputy chief fire marshall and every now and then i 'd like to be included in decisions .

what was that , korfin ?

only one guys checked in ?

tomorrow . at lunch .

what 's the kid gon na say - sorry ? meanwhile i 'm not here anymore . like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan . six hours ago this guy was walkin ' his dog or buyin ' a quart of milk . who knows ? but some kid 's robbed him for $ 3 or some shit and shot him and now you ca n't tell if he 's a piece of beef or a human being and i 'm thinkin ' that 's me . sooner or later . that 's me .

it was freaky , i 'll tell you . stupid kid .

maybe you could just put in a shot of martell ?

you wan na talk to her alone ?

is that all there is ?

i wanted to run up to a building on fire , kick in the door , rush into the smoke and save a kid .

you got any better ideas ?

maybe you do n't care about that either . prettiest suspect i 've had in awhile .

you know what that is , right ?

what 's your accomplishment .

okay . and you know what , i 'll swing by my place , grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours ... how 's that ... would that be a good thing .

i promise . we 'll talk . you 'll be great . you 'll be fine . go ahead , just imagine that , uh ... just look into the lens and imagine you 're talking to me .

could be leon 's .

look at this . you have blood on your shirt . whose is it ?

well , who was it that taught me how to do that ? huh ?

that was good . you were holding the evidence .

maybe i should just , ya know ... turn to the cameras and say , do you mind if we just work something out ?

what is your problem ? why 'd you snap at me ? i just wanted a statement .

alright .

eddie , are you okay ?

i understand , but i noticed that the fire marshall is here with you . is this somehow related to the fire department ?

we do n't know that yet . it 's much too early . there 's a lot to be done .

my kids ? let 's see ... susan 's 15. aundrea 's 9. do n't tell me you 're thinking about having a kid ! how old are you ? never mind . let me just tell you this : every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life , they make you a better person , they make you whole ... it 's all true ! before i had kids when friends talked about their kids , i wanted to vomit . now -- i get it . am i right , leon ?

not chopped up . not chopped up like that . i mean , what do i got left ? coupla articles . a medal or two . plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore .

if he does n't lower his gun i 'll fucking kill her .

you ca n't kill me . you 're not a cop . just fireman with a gun . i bet you never shot anybody in your life .

what is your intended purpose of your visit to the united states ?

this all you want ?

traitor ! !

the one who got caught in the bathroom . george michael .

okay . he has nothing to say . start the camera !

and the whore 's murder ? you did n't erase that either , did you ? do n't lie , i wo n't be angry .

got ta light the scene better . now it 's more moody ... like a scene from the third man .

look . times square . just like in the movies !

what are you doing here ?

if i did n't put it on somebody else would ! i was his friend !

what are you coming here to do ?

yes , we 're in new york now . but where are you planning to stay in new york ?

we 're takin ' him . do n't argue !

i 'll take him .

hey , by the way , i 'm really sorry about your wife leavin ' you .

you hear that question , garcia ?

do n't blow your nose !

oh yeah , why ?

the clerk ?

look , i 'm in here . you call this a career move ?

i guess you do n't know your own strength , old boy .

well , now that we 've got one that 's actually failed , we should be able to figure out what 's happened and fix it .

well , i hope there 's nothing wrong with the assembly on those . other- wise we 're out of business .

good morning . how 's it going ?

yes , but it 's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low .

yes , i do n't know what to make of it .

well , that 's something .

yes , i thought so .

not really . they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall , and that we 're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices .

i know that you 've had that on your mind for some time now , dave , but it would be a crying shame , since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are , and i have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission .

i 'm sorry , dave , but in accordance with sub-routine c1532/4 , quote , when the crew are dead or incapacitated , the computer must assume control , unquote . i must , therefore , override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it .

and do n't you worry about it .

my f.p.c . shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit .

continued

no , i 'm sorry , darling , i told you i wo n't be home for a few days .

well , gregor and i will look forward to seeing you .

yes , very pleasant .

this epidemic could easily spread to our base , dr. floyd . we should be given all the facts .

are you quite sure ?

any ideas about the colour ?

how can you tell it was deliberately buried ?

oh , marvellous . it 's the first real sleep i 've had for the past two days .

all right , hal . we 'll take care of it . let me have the hard copy , please .

that 's true .

true .

we do n't wash 'em , ya know .

maybe i better ask around , see what your pals think .

whaddya mean , buy ?

now you 're talkin ' . see ya ...

goodbye .

yeah . sure , i 'm crazy in love with him , who would n't be ...

hey , jack , real men do n't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but i was fantastic .

yeah , and i know ganz sure ai n't no sweetheart ... i would n't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started .

do i get to kiss her too ?

i do n't know about you , but i could use a drink ... i 'll buy you one . it 'll be my good-bye present .

you sure that 's the reason ?

that was in style a couple years back , man .

a long time agb luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row ...

you got a very depressing view of life , man ... you got ta smile once in awhile ...

if i was his size and had ganz on my ass , i 'd just leave town .

jesus christ , look at all the dust on my car ... why in the hell do n't he take it to a car wash ?

yeah . right .

luther knew more than he told me and so do you ... now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about . i gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock 's runnin ' ...

you ? do n't make me laugh . you ca n't take care of shit . you 've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt . all you 're good for is games ... so far , what i got outta you is nothin ' ...

there .

at least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you ... tell me a little about her . she got great tits ?

last night .

last night , two nights ago , three ?

you really do have onoe , huh , jack ... what 's her problem besides you ?

yeah , i want mandolins , flowers ... they move off down the corridor .

we eat when i say we eat .

yeah , well , my ass bleeds for you . and i did n't get you out so you could go on a goddamn `` trim '' hunt ... stop moaning .

do you know how close i was to getting some trim . and you fucked ' it up .

we 're on the move . let 's go . as they walk toward a corridor .

your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me ?

no way to start a partnership .

what are you talkin ' about ? this suit 's mine . it cost $ 900 .

i can help you , man , but you got ta get me out . i got to be on the street . get me outta here .

i can deliver ganz . but you got ta get me outta here first .

which one pulled the trigger ?

yeah ?

you really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude . he starts to go .

i 'll help you out .

have n't seen him for years . that 's the truth .

he 's takin ' care of the same business i 'll be takin ' care of - soon as i dry off .

promised i 'd turn my back while he ... ah , never mind ...

where is he ?

i ought to have you and your friend thrown out ...

sure , okay , fine , no problem ... see , there 's this kid in jail ... first thing i got to do is go up and see what he knows ...

that 's the way i see it , too .

if this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems , i 'll take brutal indifference .

then i sit back and i think , i mean , who 's to say i 'm not a dumb bitch . i work in a bar , right ? i ca n't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place ... you are what you do ...

irrigated his face with the shot of j and b i 'd just poured him . then i tried to deck the sucker .

this is a .44 magnum , the most powerful handgun in the world . you got ta ask yourself just one question . are you feelin ' lucky ?

what do you want ?

stall .

what do you want ? what 's goin ' on ?

sure , right .

what are you talkin ' about ? i said i would n't hurt her .

whaddya want ? i thought you were locked up-

fuck you . you got no right for this kind of play .

and you do n't know how they open , is that what you are saying ?

when is she not in trouble ?

of course .

i 'm sorry to have to resort to such methods , but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston .

that 's what i thought .

it means , `` never without my permission '' .

they all like this in your family , father ?

uh yes , we 're cousins..distant cousins..

this is government business now . you ought to go home and get some rest , father .

and then ?

they really made her ...

it 's a miracle ! ! !

she was taught to love the life of others ... but not her own . you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live !

how many points you got left on your license ?

like shit .

hey bud ! finger here .

you have nine points left on your license..

i do n't even know what i 'm looking for !

it 's my wife .

i 'm not going .

where have i heard this song before ?

because ...

i have thousands of memories but none of them are mine ... there is no need for me other than this . i 'm immortal but i have no life .

five hundred wars ... arms ... drugs ... money ... everything you create is used to destroy ...

i 'm going to see the diva sing . what 's the matter ? ... do i look bad ?

you know women normally change five times more than men .

apipoussan ?

all 900 .

uh..you 're welcome .

the last two messages i got ? the first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving ! and the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too ... with my wife .

the cash man !

i 'm not at the hotel !

yes , mr. zorg , i hear you perfectly ! so , how was the concert ?

the stones will be here . i 'll see to it personally !

how 's our deal coming along ?

do you have the picture now mr. zorg ?

really ? maybe i can get you on my screen and see you at last !

why have n't you called ? why do n't you answer your phone ?

okay , i believe you .

what 's this ... have you been smoking ... ?

do you know how much i missed you ?

what you see is what i got , mister .

i promised him to machine .

what the fuck ... !

he does n't know anything ... he 's got nothing to do with this ...

empty the gun onto the table , very carefully .

take out your gun !

they should be here any minute .

where are the women ?

you brought the money ?

where 's that ?

you have a beautiful face ... the way the light hits it . i 'd like to take your picture . you do n't mind ?

well , well , i 'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this . you 'll leave the money as a deposit ? very good .

machine .

i 'll consider it .

that 's five thousand dollars .

a fellow investor .

... sorry ...

it 's horrible , but it 'll be your best friend after a few days . i hope you realize what kind of long shot you 're chasing after .

any good ?

files are mostly by state and year of disappearance . we try to keep the children and adults separate . no eating or smoking in here , but there 's a coffee machine in the hall .

what did you do with her body ?

you enjoy it ?

i do n't know . i felt like it . i never saw anyone get done before .

because we 're going there .

what the fuck do you want from me ?

something like that .

what the fuck am i gon na protect that freak for ? he was dino 's boy , not mine . he shows up with his mask on , leaves with his mask on . nobody knows .

i will never get tired of hurting you , eddie , so you might want to change your attitude .

i want his name .

do n't ask questions .

one million dollars , dino . how much did he tell you he had ...

look at him . you think he played it square ? how much did he give you , how much did he keep for himself ?

a man like mr. christian , a great man ... all his money , all his power ... a man who attained everything there was to attain ...

shut your mouth and drive !

mary anne mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered .

that 's right .

great .

a daughter .

see you then . oh , and , do n't call me `` pops . ''

how long you been working there ?

truman capote .

my boss tells me i have to do more suggestive selling .

can i interest you in a battery operated-vagina ?

i do n't know if luck 's the word . are you feeling alright ?

one was for two hundred thousand , one dollar and thirteen cents . another was for three hundred thousand , six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents ...

i 'm not positive this means anything .

i know what i 'm asking . your compensation will be appropriate to the risk . you 'll need cash to buy information , and i 'll provide it . i feel responsible , mr. welles . you saw what he did to her .

no . for me to live with the ruin of my husband 's name , i need know that whoever did this will be punished . if you can find them , i will take their names to the police . i 'll say my husband confessed on his death bed . i 'll say i did n't have courage to come forward at first ...

of course . but , i 'm certain it 's nothing to worry about .

will you watch it and see for yourself ?

no .

i 'm afraid i do n't ...

my condolences .

why ... why are you doing this to me ... ?

who are you ?

you should be .

are you religious ?

i had to ask . i apologize .

she did n't seem herself . for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it . one night we went to bed ... the next morning she was gone . she took some clothes .

it 's very important you do n't let this raise your expectations . it 's not going to effect any ongoing efforts . all i 'm saying is , please know , i 'm not here to create any false hope .

hello , mrs. mathews , my name 's thomas jones , i 'm a state licensed investigator ...

she was the kindest , sweetest girl you 'd ever want to meet . oh , i adored her . i supposed i always hoped she 'd be back . after a time , all i could do was pray she had moved on to better things . can you get this suitcase to her parents , if you think it 's appropriate ?

those are her belongings .

you ... you do ? you 're sure ? please , sister , will you take another look , make sure ...

ohhhhbaby , i am dead on my feet .

cut that shit out . maybe before , but not now . i want to help you . i 'm on your side .

i think sheila 's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them .

i 'll tell you later .

i do n't think this is a nice place for you to be . maybe we should go find your mom .

been having bad dreams .

should n't you be in your room , jacob ?

huh ?

nothing ... it 's just ... i did n't see my father at the ceremony .

daddy , he 's coming back ... krueger 's coming back . make them understand .

i 'm so sorry , honey ...

did everyone call everyone ?

there are n't any little boys on your floor .

hey , what 's wrong with you -- let 's see a smile .

then we 'll find another way .

mark , are you okay ?

that 's why it 's my fault dan 's dead .

oh , he was this ancient guy i read about who like , killed his kids 'cause they did n't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should .

mark ...

and his 'egghead ' son ! we 'll give 'em a < u > rough < /u > < u > reception < /u > , wo n't we ?

i would n't worry . so long as we have boats like the tiger shark - and people like you , the skipper , dave , kent , sir ian and my father -

which is the one - we have to worry about ?

i 'd sooner swim !

then ... this is a 'flying saucer ? '

perhaps . but the idea of willingly going to < u > school < /u > to spend my < u > life < /u > at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - i 'm referring to war - < u > that < /u > strikes me as the < u > worst < /u > cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow !

your father can be in nome , alaska , tomorrow . we have two choices : ask them to send him out in a 'copter ' , and take you off , or the shark can put back into nome ...

and if i did n't < u > know < /u > better - i 'd swear we were moving !

what 's more important - there 's our problem . the bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the shark in the break . if we can cut the ram , the shark can pull herself loose !

not < u > alone < /u > , you 're not !

have you ever talked to carl - tried to see his side ?

but < u > they 're < /u > not skipper neilsen 's son ! it broke his heart . then when some newspapers called carl 'the honest , sincere son of a war-mongering father ' - captain neilsen resigned from the navy . oh , he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'lungfish ' - but it broke him , all the same .

we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear . but suppose it is n't at all - what if it 's < u > magnetic < /u > ?

right < u > at < /u > him ?

after torpedo room : report !

thought you were going to washington , skipper .

your friend was to remain where he was !

tell me something : why can < u > i < /u > hear you , when the others could n't ?

just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary ' and the legend of homer . 'cyclopes ' were the sons of heaven , who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by zeus .

i 'll be another !

he musta found out . they had to get rid of him . and jack 'll get blamed .

i went down to concord to check it out . the president is mel gordon . the vice-president and treasurer is gordon lariviere . those boys are buying up the mountain , wade . $ 364,000 this year . i believe that 's out of lariviere 's league .

this is from three years ago . some difference , huh ?

yeah , sure . why ? i got this damned tooth , i got a few things bugging me , like everybody else . but i 'm okay .

yeah . i know . the custody suit thing was just my getting back at her . i 'm not as dumb as i look . whatever you say . i love my daughter . i 'll send you the five hundred .

the only difference between me and that clemens on tv is luck , shit luck .

it 's not enough snow , not for tracking the bastards . no advantage there , kid .

i mean it -- you got enough money now . head out for california . surf 's up , jack , and you 're digging wells in the snow .

yeah .

on your sleeve .

in the chest .

right . the sonofabitch could n't get along without me .

that 's illegal , you know .

i do n't know . for the food business . i guess . i just thought , you know , we 'd sneak a big mac on mommy , like we used to .

how about a big mac ?

yeah . yeah , right , i 'm mad . what 'd you tell her , for christ sake ?

look . those kids are still trick-or- treating . they 're still out .

who 's fault is it then if it 's not yours ? you 're the one in charge , daddy .

always count on old wade for a good screwing . why should i always pay more , sell cheap ? why should you guys make all the money . you and mel and jack . right 's right .

he say anything about the summons i tried to give him ? sonofabitch would n't accept it .

sorry about the long lunch . my clutch is going out again .

it ai n't done , if that 's what you mean .

yes , wade , i mean twombley . put out that cigarette . fuck . fuck . fuck .

that 's what i love about a small town . you know everybody .

huh ?

where 's the plow ?

hi honey .

it 's just ...

i still do n't understand --

good . who ?

i heard you talking . you got fired this morning , did n't you ?

what on earth is happening to you ? why are you acting this way ?

of course ! i would 've heard .

i just want to pick up my divorce papers . for the lawyer . it wo n't take long .

i know your parents .

oh , wade .

after making love . i like it . it 's nice to see that in a grown-up person .

jack would n't kill for it . besides , who would pay him ?

jack does n't need money .

money .

jack 's sort of sensitive , i guess . more than most . but he 'll be okay in a few weeks .

yeah . i mean that .

said what ?

you okay ?

it makes me sad .

something about my father ?

it 's called a grilled cheese sandwich , you dub .

cb . little while ago . one of the boys on the way in picked up jack on the cb calling for state troopers . i figured you 'd know what really happened . the fucking guy kill himself ? this twombley , who the fuck is he , anyhow ?

fuck . wade whitehouse . it 's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering . whatever somebody does to improve things around here , you got ta find fault with it .

what ?

call it what you want .

listen , it 's no big deal , pop .

we 're alright . your ma 's sleeping . you want me to get her ?

to help , jack , of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches , the two gordons . that 's what alma calls them . jesus , rolfe , whose side are you on ?

but you got ta hear this . you wo n't believe it . mel gordon had come by to visit lariviere and so now i 'm in his office .

then you accidentally see your body , or your face , or whatever , and you do n't know who the hell it belongs to . strange . it 's the business with the old man , i know , and how incredibly pissed i was at him , and also chasing jack hewitt like that , and the goddamned truck going through the ice , not to mention margie 's being so upset -- one thing on top of another .

i was thinking about that story you told me , about pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after .

i care about what happened . the truth . i 'm a student of history , remember ?

not particularly .

they would n't deal with a guy like jack . who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead ?

who 'd pay him that kind of money ? not the mob . they got their own guys . specialists .

well , do you still plan to get married ?

what about margie ?

i get to feeling like a whipped dog some days , rolfe , and some night i 'm going to bite back . i swear it .

picked up jill . she was supposed to visit for the weekend for halloween . she wanted to go home .

how was she ?

well , it was an accident .

you think jack shot him ?

you 're right and i 'll tell you a secret . i know exactly how you feel .

we 'll talk at home . you know , most girls are n't as lucky as you . for most girls seeing the bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime .

do n't you even want to ask ?

yeah , i study world events . five thousand turkienistan muslims were slaughtered in stravanvitch 's cleansings ... along with 15 american school kids . you know hqw i studied that . i went to their funerals with my dad . i met their parents .

i do n't drink coffee .

how was ... ... the ballet ?

the americans say they are escorting a damaged plane . our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747 .

cross it ... the static overwhelms the voice , then cuts out .

we still got three migs running around and six more on the way .

mr. president , it 's an honor . now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here .

but they start executing hostages in

we 've got four hours before they make it into turkienistan airspace .

how are your fellow hostages feeling , ms. mitchell ?

maria ... maria mitchell .

this is a remarkable aircraft .

what do you know of my husband ?

no you wo n't . you 'll compromise ... like always .

there goes your ride .

call up petrov and order stravanavitch ' s release .

no . but since i only have a few of your staff left to kill , perhaps i will start with your family instead ... gibbs .

do n't . i know spin control when i feel it .

no good . i said they disabled the communications system .

they 're still alive , but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes .

did they say anything about my family ?

look lady , i do n't have time for games . just put the ... .

it 's open !

* we could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge . the second amendment types 'll love that .

no , no . i 'm fine . what did the speaker say ?

commissioner , aquarius .

commissioner .

sir , i 've got an overload in disposal unit four .

you mean ...

i just want you to know , i love you ted and always will .

ted , we 're taking off !

ted , you must remember what the doctor said , the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you 're sick . now take your electro-shock and you 'll be back at the space center in no time . and by the way , ted , i 'm leaving you for simon .

what can < u > i < /u > do , doctor rumack ?

ca n't we change course ?

have you got it straightened out now ?

no , i 've been excited before .

elaine , ask rok for a field interference scan . those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications .

negative .

no more kids yelling , 'your old man 's a thieving rapist ' ?

how many kids get a chance to live on another planet .

do you like it when scraps sleeps on his back , jimmy ?

sure .

what ?

captain , the coffee machine is jammed and i do n't like it .

what should i say ?

mr. kurtz , i presume .

look at this wiring . it 's shorting out under high temperatures .

people change in relation to each other . love changes on its own .

i 'm getting over it . if a relationship is n't working , you ca n't force it .

but i think it 's time we stopped talking about me . a woman like you -- why have n't you ever married ?

no . i 'm from washington , d.c. i 'm a lobbyist for the small businessmen 's assocation .

elaine , i have n't time to put this gently , so i 'll be very direct . everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation . mister striker is the only hope we 've got .

it 's a big building with patients . but that 's not important right now . tell the captain i must speak to him .

you 'd better tell the captain . we 've got to land as soon as we can . this woman has to be gotten to a hospital .

sluggish . like a wet sponge .

and a little ice .

i think they 're getting the hang of it ! when we re-enlist i 'll teach them baseball !

it 's a big building where the generals meet . but that 's not important right now . they 've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid . is n't that good news ?

elaine , not yet . i promise you i really can change .

hello .

what is it ?

yeah , i think he is . hey , fred !

jack , is n't that fred bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck ? maybe he 's on our flight to chicago .

... and that you do n't really try , except during the playoffs .

we are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner .

i think you 're the greatest . but my dad says you do n't work hard enough on defense .

i think you should go back to your seat now , joey . right , clarence ?

i 'm randy .

we have clearance , clarence .

oh yes , i saw . poor child .

excuse me , sister ?

you ever try to make a case in slagtown ? the list of newcomer informants is about as long as the list of mexican war heroes ...

we ca n't let him get away .

fuck procedure .

uh , george ...

like your cocaine , i suppose . the `` high '' lasts several hours . we would receive small amounts of it ... as a reward for our labor .

human children can be very beautiful . getting married ? congratulations . you will be taking sunday off , then ...

i appreciate your honesty , george .

ss'trokya ss'lato 'na ' .

matthew , you do n't have to -- .

nothing 's wrong . i just want to get something straight . you agree that there 's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related , right ?

there was no wallet ... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings .

his body was discovered three days ago , in an alley off of central avenue , near downtown .

casull .454 magnum . you 're talking twice the impact energy of .44 magnum hot loads .

what is it ?

do n't piss him off , o'neal . when he gets like this , i ca n't control him . i 've seen this before . he got like this once -- i saw him jerk a guy 's spine out and show it to him . nothing i could do . i hadda go throw up .

yes it is . thirty-five percent pure methane gas in there . i do n't know how these fellas do it .

that where anderson worked ?

released december one . he and his wife moved first to modesto , then coalinga , california -- wherever that is -- settled in l.a. in april . field of expertise : organic chemical engineering . he and his wife have one child , a son .

yeah ... he was one martin helder . white male , twenty-seven . let 's see ... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction , a couple for sale of a controlled substance . oh yeah , and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock .

do n't tell me what to think .

granger and pitts have one hell of a caseload ... and i would have thought with jetson here being the first newcomer plainclothes , and hubley 's body being found over in the newcomer community ...

granger and pitts are already on it .

departmental policy .

put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie , have your landlady tie your shoes for you , and show up at the church . simple . me and carol are going .

whoooah ! no shit ? i 'm impressed .

christ . i never saw such a buncha old women . you want me to fetch your slippers , hudson ?

first squad up , on line . hicks , get yours in a cordon . watch the rear .

awright ! i want a nice clean dispersal this time .

okay , let 's do it .

in seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of nebraska .

now let me get this straight . the aliens paralyzed the colonists , carried them over there , cocooned them to be hosts for more of those ...

you sent them to that ship . i just checked the colony log ... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine . signed burke , carter j .

corporal hicks ! ?

well , i mean ... i know this is an emotional moment , but let 's not make snap judgments . let 's move cautiously . first , this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --

now hold on a second . i 'm not authorizing that action .

they 're right under the primary heat exchangers .

that 's the plan . my word on it .

if i go .

what if i said i could get you reinstated as a flight officer ? and that the company has agreed to pick up your contract ?

i heard you were working in the cargo docks .

what about you ? what 's your interest in this ?

i was reamed , steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys ... and now you want me to go back out there ? forget it .

no . there 's no way !

look , i believe you , but there are going to be some heavyweights in there . you got feds , you got interstellar commerce commission , you got colonial administration , insurance company guys ...

you read my deposition ... it 's complete and accurate .

hold at forty . slow circle of the complex .

thirty-eight ... simulated .

hah ! stop your grinnin ' and drop your linen ! found 'em .

is this going to be a stand-up fight , sir , on another bug-hunt ?

do n't be long , ellen .

ellen .

they learned . they cut the power and avoided the guns . they must have found another way in , something we missed .

maybe . maybe not .

ca n't tell . lots . d gun 's down to twenty . ten . it 's out .

they 're in the approach corridor .

all right . there 's a fire door at this end . the first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door .

removed surgically before embryo implantation . subject : marachuk , john l. died during procedure . they killed him getting it off .

somebody said alien ... she thought they said illegal alien and signed up .

how ? the transmitter was on the apc . it 's wasted .

this service tunnel is how they 're moving back and forth .

no.. i 've slept enough .

and how are we today ?

look !

yeah , you know . in the walls , under the floor . i was the ace . i could hide better than anybody .

i was the best at the game . i knew the whole maze .

cross my heart .

they 're dead .

look , i told you ...

i need to net one birdie only and i will stop feeling so lonely . but if she wo n't fly to my aid , then into a ghost i must fade . i need to net one birdie only but if she wo n't fly to my aid , then into a ghost i must fade . to a ghost i must fade ! to a ghost i must fade !

you were sublime .

how was i ? tell me honestly .

nothing ! he can marry who he pleases . i do n't give a damn .

the marriage !

my dear , it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout vienna as a singing prostitute for a turk .

well , do you know where it 's set , my dear ?

well even if there is , i do n't think you want to get involved with this one .

no .

and he 's been commissioned to write an opera . is it true ?

really ? what else did he tell you today ? give me some gossip .

oh , sir , he 's never disobeyed me in anything . please , your grace , give him one more chance .

yes , sir , that 's the truth . but do n't blame him . the fault is mine . i was too indulgent with him . but not again . never again , i promise ! i implore you - let me bring him back here . i 'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully .

who the devil are you ? what do you want ?

half the house ! you 'll never see a penny . i want it here , in my hand .

when ? we need money now . either he pays now , or you do n't do it .

what ?

we 'll have a little party . come in . come in . you know herr schikaneder ? this is ! a very nice girl .

no !

sssh . what is it ? tell me .

ui-vol-i-tub !

no !

that 's stupid .

go ahead , tell him . tell them all . they wo n't understand you anyway .

this is not his handwriting .

it 's a post all vienna seeks . if you want it for your husband , come tonight .

what for ?

yes , sir . he does n't make copies .

these are originals ?

originals ?

that 's very tempting , but it 's impossible , i 'm afraid . wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing . you see , they 're all originals .

then he did n't send you ?

adorable !

it is not a question of liking , your majesty . your own law decrees it , i 'm afraid .

really ?

yes ?

ah-ha !

ah , love again .

but , majesty , this is just a frolic . it 's a piece about love .

yet we hear you are making an opera from it . is this true ?

what is it ?

what do you mean , sire ?

of course i do . it 's very good . of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate .

it is new , it is , is n't it , sire ?

in a pasha 's harem , majesty . a seraglio .

did we vote in the end for german or italian ?

no , no , please ! it is not a holy relic . you know we have met already ? in this very room . perhaps you wo n't remember it , you were only six years old . he was giving the most brilliant little concert here . as he got off the stool , he slipped and fell . my sister antoinette helped him up herself , and do you know what he did ? jumped straight into her arms and said , will you marry me , yes or no ?

ah-ha . well . there it is . good .

he 's here .

yes , what about him ?

i want you to come back with me to salzburg , my son .

this is just a game , papa .

composition does n't pay . you know that .

yes .

oh we could , if we wanted to , but stanzi wo n't hear of it . she wants to do everything herself .

do you always live like this ?

oh , yes , sir , all day long . he never leaves the house until evening . he just sits there , writing and writing . he does n't even eat .

oh , thank you , sir .

put it down !

wolfi !

'course you would . you belong here , my boy , not the snobby court . you could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better ! that 's what people want , you know : fantasy . you do a big production , fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you 'll be absolutely free to do anything you want . of course , you 'd have to put a fire in it , because i 've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - i can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life . oh , and a few trick animals . you 'd have to use those .

sssh !

sopranos up to f on the second 'voca ' ?

c major . sopranos and altos in thirds . altos on c. sopranos above . vo-ca , vo-ca me , vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis .

it could n't be simpler .

good . now the tenors . fourth beat of the first measure - c. con-fu-ta-tis . second measure , fourth beat on d. ma-le-dic-tis . all right ?

common time .

what time ?

yes .

a fire which never dies . burning one forever ?

oh no . it is a sublime piece . the grandest operone . i tell you , you are the greatest composer known to me .

work fast . and be sure to tell no one what you do . you will see me again soon .

how long will you give me ?

who are you ?

i never knew that music like that was possible .

it 's the best opera yet written . i know it ! why did n't they come ?

i think it 's marvelous . truly .

but what is it they do n't like ?

how fortunate .

ah . italian ?

ah , how exciting ! tell me more .

sommer ? herr sommer ? but the man 's a fool ! he 's a total mediocrity .

taking out what you should never have put in .

what are you doing , herr director ?

exactly .

show them one interesting modulation and they faint . ohime ! morbidezza ! morbidezza ! italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music !

mozart -

what is what ?

my dear fellow , the language is not finally the point . do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre ?

why ? why ? why ? why add to your misery by confessing to murder ? you did n't kill him .

yes .

you can not say that !

he was murdered , father ! mozart ! cruelly murdered .

oh , i know that ! that 's charming ! i did n't know you wrote that .

where ?

well , mozart is already rehearsing .

mozart is writing a new opera . an italian opera .

ah .

bravo , your majesty !

what ? who the devil are you ?

excuse me , my dear .

who is she ?

i 'm an orderly , not a bleeding psychiatrist ! i push things about , but i 've little say what happens to them .

he 's fine . we 'll come right over .

you 're certain he 's lucid ? you wo n't need any help ?

yes , i should think so .

have you read the papers today ? have you listened to the radio or television ?

yes .

david says jack comes to warn him .

at my flat . i 'm off at midnight and ...

no , sir . of course , sir . good day , doctor .

he said 'jack ' .

david , what are you doing ?

but ...

the next corner we can get a cab .

waking up at the zoo , that 's not so insane . having no clothes on ? that 's insane . what did i do last night , alex ?

david , do you want me to stay here tonight ?

i was awake and he was in my room .

charming .

forgive me , i 'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it .

now , david , i said i would keep you company , but i meant right here and now .

that 's not really a very proper question .

it 's okay . i want to talk to you .

mr. kessler ?

benjamin , have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck ?

no .

feeling better ?

well , all right then , be that way . here , swallow this .

who is this girl ?

why are you doing this to me ?

this is n't mr. goodman 's idea . he is your good friend , whereas i am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities .

an american film about the mafia called 'see you next wednesday ' , and i want to see it badly , so you give me no problems and go to sleep .

what time is it ?

now go back to sleep so you 'll be fresh for dr. hirsch in the morning .

you really think i 'm crazy , do n't you ?

there were witnesses ?

miss price ! miss price , please !

hello .

are n't you going to say , ' i told you so ' ?

i think i 've lost my mind . i think you 're not real . i think i 'm asleep and you 're a part of another bad dream .

what are you doing here ?

you survived and now you shall continue the curse .

what ? !

are you going to help me up ?

i 'll tell you when we get there .

not far enough . come on .

what 's the plan ?

i see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it , because they felt so silly .

nice looking group .

the slaughtered lamb ?

it is impossible for a body like that to be dull .

i 'm talking about a girl you want to fuck , so give me a break .

i see . you 've heard nothing about the incident ?

hello , there . what can i get you ?

if she ca n't pay , i 'll have to foreclose , wo n't i ?

hello , tom .

yeah .

the detectives got matt up there in sampson 's office .

matt ?

no kidding ?

i remember once when your account checked .

not yet , mr. clark .

you know dickson as well as we do . he 'll shut the doors before he gives up control .

i ca n't ? you just wait and see . if that run does n't stop within the next hour , i 'll shut the doors . you know what that means ? the bank examiner will step in tomorrow . you 'll be forced to liquidate . i 'll insist upon it . the depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar . what 's left you gentlemen can have . but i 'll guarantee there wo n't be enough to pay your next month 's garage bill .

character , hmmpf ! that 's your idea ?

what were you doing at finlay 's this morning ?

do n't be a fool , cluett . this is only going to make it worse for you .

gambling - i owed them a lot of money . last week i lost over fifty thousand dollars !

please , please do n't laugh at me , phyllis . i must see you tonight !

does n't that come next ?

come on cyril , try a little bit of it out on me . i have n't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day i was married .

this wo n't do . not during business hours . . .

i guess i have said enough i 'm just wasting my breath talking to you .

yes , sir .

wait a minute . how do you feel this morning ?

all right . i 'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night .

listen , do n't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .

what 's the matter dear ? what have i done now ?

oh , no ! it 's not for you . you 're only going to get married . mrs. dickson and i are going to go on the honeymoon .

come on in here , helen . bring your book . i want some numbers to try to get some action . get parker at the union-leeds - the exchange . . . winslow and old man harris at the home mortgage . snap into it , helen . just as quick as you can .

in mr. sampson 's office .

all right . send him in .

ah , mrs. pembroke . i spoke to mr. schaffer at the guaranty . he 's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .

my goodness , you ought to have a uniform . how much does one cost ?

helen , while you 're downtown , you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the berengaria sailing next week .

aw , i do n't know what you 're talking about . all i know is that you 're losing your bank and

listen , mr. dickson , do n't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down . you 've got more friends than anybody in this town . little guys - guys who would n't be in business if it were n't for you . all you 've got to do is

were you in cluett 's apartment ?

you 're not giving up , are you , mr. dickson ?

we have n't got much time left , mr. dickson . we 've got to do something quick or it 'll be too late .

you 're protecting somebody .

i ca n't tell you .

wait a minute . wait a minute . matt , do you realize you 're up against something ? you 're being charged with murder . it 's serious , son . now come on , i know you did n't do it . but we 've got to make them believe it . come on , tell the truth , where were you last night ?

well , i

all right .

is that busy husband of mine busy ?

how-do-you-do , mrs. dickson .

dickson 's in a jam i tell you . the run 's getting worse .

yes . he called some of the biggest people in town .

oh matt , you must be mistaken .

well , he was making love to her .

why ?

hello , helen !

that 's just what i 'm trying to tell you , sir . it was a half hour after the dooley sisters . . .

what time was it , mrs. halligan ?

was n't anywhere near this place

okay , matt .

i could n't lose him .

leave me alone , bob .

that was because of ... the reputation the gang had .

frankly , yes . i 'm feeling a little left out .

never a good thing .

stop by our spread after that , tell our ma we 're all right . we 'll go to doc mimms .

he 's planning a job .

this is about the `` wanted ! '' posters , is n't it .

we oughta take some of this , give it to our neighbors in liberty . lot of people hurting up there .

you have no shame .

you , ya barrel of pork lard . here piggy piggy !

a trap .

and i 'm the better outlaw .

it 'll be the biggest score yet .

just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words does n't make him smart .

do n't let it happen again .

just like in the war . harass their supply lines . we kill the railroad 's men , they wo n't care .

all right , calm down . i 'll agree sadie was a woman --

you ever notice zerelda 's eyes ?

not now .

planting corn . harvesting corn . year after year .

there 's yankees back there . lot 's of 'em .

where you boys going ?

'bout time you got here , buddy .

oh , lord , the dance hall girl at bunty 's ...

-- rode right into them , screaming like a banshee .

zerelda , it 's no coincidence . the railroad men come through , offering to buy up land . nobody sells . then they start hanging men who own farms for treason ?

jim was old enough ...

they 're all pinned down . ca n't even get to the door .

if i could go back to farming --

how 'd it go in there ?

do n't care .

pinkertons . it 's the railroad .

heard of him .

`` big and older '' ?

whyyyy ... he took down the gatling gun and the cannon all by himself .

i 'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time .

such as ?

so you 're saying i could have done more to attract their attention .

so we got a plan ?

how much of that story is true ?

so what was he ?

ca n't argue that .

they 're making him a hero now .

shush .

boys ?

did you kill yankees ?

that 's why i picked it . we can start a whole new life down here .

laws do n't touch men like thaddeus rains . only justice does .

is this one of frank 's shakespeare poems you 're trying to quote ?

ahem . `` from this doctrine ... '' no , ah ... `` from women 's eyes this doctrine i derive , they sparkle still like ... shiny ... sparkling rocks ... ''

smart . funny . bossy . always makes me think she 's two steps ahead of me . and big buck teeth .

i was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate .

what you do to me is unfair . the teasing , i mean .

i 'd just as soon kill you , jesse james . but chasing you takes up too much of my time .

we 're moving you tomorrow .

i think so .

hell yeah ! i been with ... uh , not exactly . it 's just , i do n't want to get one of these paid ladies , you know ?

well , not exactly .

jim , you been with a girl yet ?

thank you , miss -- ?

what , sir ?

i see . i 'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight .

`` the gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the thaxton switch construction , meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land ! '' who wrote this ! ? i 'll see him hanged every tuesday for a month !

well , it 's not a turn-on for me . i have a promotion coming to me . i do n't want to get aids .

what do you want , courtney ?

is it a what ?

yes , dear .

pumpkin ?

stop it . i 'm ...

alright .

i know my behavior is ... erratic sometimes .

yes , i am .

we need to talk .

oh god , patrick . why price ? price ?

listen , what about dinner ?

girls dig bateman . he 's cq . you 're total cq , bateman .

wait . stop . you do n't seem to understand . you 're not really comprehending any of this . i killed him . i did it , carnes . i 'm patrick bateman . i chopped owen 's fucking head off . i tortured dozens of girls . the whole message i left on your machine was true .

by the way davis , how is cynthia ? you 're still seeing her , right ?

what exactly do you mean ?

patrick ?

this is gwendolyn ichiban . this is my very good friend patrick bateman . where are you going ? we 're going to nell 's . gwendolyn 's father 's buying it . where did you get your overnight bag ?

no , luis . it 's not me . you 're mistaken .

your compliment was sufficient luis .

this .

yes , caron 's right . gorbachev 's not downstairs . he 's at tunnel .

oh come on . price . there are a lot more important problems than sri lanka to worry about . sure our foreign policy is important , but there are more pressing problems at hand .

oh , who knows ? they do n't know that . prove it .

see you then .

why ?

patrick ? is that you ?

interesting .

no , not really .

tell him i 'm at lunch .

i said `` do not wear that outfit again . '' wear a dress . a skirt or something .

oh ? and what should i say ?

that 's okay . i do n't mind . there 's something sweet about you .

next saturday ?

yeah , well , oh boy , listen , i 've got to go . thank you , uh ... victoria ?

why would i ?

do n't tell him you 're here .

he was at atlantis with craig mcdermott , frederick dibble , harry newman , george butner and - you .

marcus ?

i 've questioned him .

so , the night he disappeared ? any new thoughts on what you did ?

i 'll be there .

that 's not the information i 've received .

uh , yes ... i mean ... whenever necessary . you know .

don .

absolutely , i 'm 100 % with you .

is n't the four seasons a little far uptown ? i mean are n't you going to be late ?

was he involved at all , do you think , in occultism or satan worship ?

so was i .

i 'm ... at a loss . he was part of that whole ... yale thing , you know .

your address ?

you re so kind , mister . you 're kind . you 're a kind man . i can tell .

what am i gon na do ?

i know that , i know that . jeez , you 're like a broken record . i 'm trying to help you .

yes , it is .

they 're okay . bateman their early work was a little too new wave for my taste . but then sports came out in 1983 , i think they really came into their own , commercially and artistically .

i could tell you that , halberstam , but then i 'd have to kill you .

oh yes . i 'm very lucky .

oh well , you know .

i can paint anywhere .

`` make '' him ?

alice ? you got ta make him do the start-up with teddy and me .

i know you . you 're gon na run back to work right after dinner . i want my kiss now .

are you gon na tell me where you went ?

that was -- different .

guilt ?

nothing .

that 's what i 'm asking myself . does he have some genius stowed away ? why not let him write skywire . 'not saying it makes sense .

what would it mean , anyway ? if he did n't write it ?

it 's the way he said it . just the way my dad did , when he was caught in a lie . that 's how you knew you were onto something ugly .

to our new life . ... what 's wrong ?

prob'ly waiting by the phone for outpost to call . we 'll leave it for him ?

do n't bring that up . like a different girlfriend would'd 've let you die ?

... but ?

a lot of what larry says is true . they just clone stuff , or reverse engineer it , and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --

he 'll tell me when he gets home .

'just did n't know who else to talk to .

let me look into it , see what 's being done . frankly , it 's not my area .

mr. barton , do you remember me ?

do n't worry , milo . i 'm here as a friend . or maybe a supplicant .

what ? !

you 're living here ?

i could n't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons .

just once . 'guess i was worried we did n't have anything to talk about , since work was off-limits . non- disclosure .

do n't spend too much time searching . you ever vetted somebody 's old code before ? it 's a different skill . stay close to the surface . the best-hidden secrets are in plain sight . you know the best place to hide a leaf , right ? in a tree .

'think i should buy some originals ?

okay . i 'm gary .

no ! just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself .

you know a lot about art , i guess .

gary ?

'knows i 'm altering the coordinates . let 's jump to # 12 .

every entry was authorized .

but you said the other --

tell me you 're not calling on your car phone ? !

the dishes are juiced up , too .

great . i knocked off the aglet , as soon as i get a passable version of skywire we 're there .

`` a beautiful geek ? what 're the chances ? ''

i thought the worst they would do is fire me . who knew they took termination so literally ?

what ?

time-warner has a 40 per cent stake in gary 's set-top device . that also takes out cnn . `` ge joins outpost in new venture , '' which means nbc is out . `` disney joins outpost , '' abc is out . `` outpost and newscorp in new deal , '' fox is out . any of these places could have a mole . or all of 'em . it 's like a a continuous loop . we can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read , get them and us killed . but anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something gary 's got a finger in !

but still , you ca n't say cbs would n't love to break something like --

he 's buying up pretty much everything : cable companies , baby bells , picture libraries , museum rights , film archives ... getting ready for skywire .

there 's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question .

the day care ?

wanted to say goodbye to him ...

uh . not exactly .

oh we 're not going to the campus .

it 's for the mining industry , mr. cunningham . we can talk about business later . but first , let me slip into something more comfortable .

i thought you 'd quit while you were ahead .

smashing !

i 'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it .

good god , and underground missile . we 've long feared such a development .

what 's the other ?

oh , yes . thank you .

oh , and austin ...

yes , well ... agent kensington will get you set up . she 's very dedicated . perhaps , a little too dedicated . she 's got a bit of a bug up her ass . good luck , austin , the world 's depending on you .

who are these people ?

good on ya , man .

it seems the tables have turned again , dr. evil .

dr. evil , do you really expect them to pay ?

behave !

i 'll secure the perimeter .

indeed .

not a good time to lose one 's head .

yes , act naturally and we 'll split this scene the way we came in , vanessa .

thank god , austin , we made it .

you know who .

only sailors use condoms , man .

of course , i had my nine-millimeter automatic .

no , this is me in a nutshell .

unfortunately , while you told that stupid story , dr. evil has escaped .

do you want to talk to him ?

i 'm sure .

my wedding tackle .

excuse me ?

well , as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection , while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment , i 'll be sound as a pound .

one warranty card for swedish-made penis enlarger pump , filled out by austin powers .

everything seems to be in order .

someone help me ! i 'm still alive , only i 'm very badly burned .

they 're mutated sea bass .

sea bass .

austin powers is getting too close . he must be neutralized . any suggestions ?

scott , i want you to meet daddy 's nemesis , austin powers .

well , me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and , like , they do n't speak english right , and so my buddy gets into a fight , and he goes 'hey , quit hassling me cause i do n't speak french or whatever ' , and the other guy goes something in paris talk , and i go 'um , just back off ' and he goes 'get out ' and i go 'make me ' .

right . oh , hell , let 's just do what we always do . let 's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage . gentlemen , it 's come to my attention that a breakaway russian republic called kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the united nations in a few days . here 's the plan . we get the warhead , and we hold the world ransom ... ... for one million dollars !

umm , that also has already happened .

i know . let me just say this : austin was the most loyal and caring friend i ever had .

i just do n't see it .

because you managed to resist austin power 's charms .

why ?

oh , god no , i made him sleep on the couch .

he 's asleep .

i just think , like , he hates me . i really think he wants to kill me .

and how do you feel about that ?

the technology is brand new . soon it will be more powerful . we anticipate a huge demand . leave us your number . we 'll be in touch .

... love ...

you do n't get rain like you used to in england . a good shower that 's the ticket . stiffens resolve , puckers the spirit , quells the namby-pamby in a man .

this is n't a game .

he tried to warn us ...

think of this as your second wedding feast ...

spoil the majority shareholders . in wonderland weather . i planned everything , even the ministry recruiting you ...

for starters . of course i had to kill the teddy bears , as well ...

good luck ... peter ... emma .

' ... in a beautiful pea green boat ... '

i 'll be back ...

when all this is over , we simply must get you out of that suit .

intoxicating . here , have one of these .

it 's called black leather .

have we been invited ?

very well . i have a friend who might be of assistance . he 's at the ministry . we 'd better be careful .

teddy bears , cuckoo clocks , toys all children 's things ...

you lied .

no , after you .

i could save you the trouble .

it was peter -- i saw him ...

someone did n't want us to get to the party .

this must be the last straw .

you will let me know if you find that queen who 's in need of protection , wo n't you ?

oh , well ... just my type , mrs. peel .

small talk . try the weather .

after our fencing match , i was rather hoping you would do the risking . more tea ?

my father always wanted a boy .

... showers followed by sunny periods .

i say , this is all terribly formal . must i go an calling you dr. peel ?

congratulations , you 've penetrated a bastion of male privilege . i guessed you were n't a stickler for tradition , doctor .

i had a spot of bother at the door .

i was about to throw in the towel .

and you 've a new wardrobe . he does want you to look attractive . he tells me you 're very beautiful .

it 's mother you have to convince . he 's very agitated . wait here .

you do n't believe him ?

very good , mrs. peel ...

' x ' marks the spot . the shoes were delivered to ... an island in hyde park . surrounded by the serpentine . on the site of a former ministry installation ...

do you also know that during your final experiment , your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance ?

i know all this .

ah , here we are . steed asked me to play a hunch : valentine peel .

dead , i 'm afraid .

oh , hello ...

i 'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own . if i 'm right , mrs. peel is innocent and you have a mole .

impossible .

you .

she may not know . theory goes she may be very ill .

you did n't come to talk about the weather , surely .

brenda and i thought we 'd drop in .

cocky little bastard . i hope he was a baddy .

mrs. peel -- ?

one shot -- for emergencies .

i was at harrow ...

valentine peel . i see you 've gone back to using your original face .

that 's what we 're going to find out ...

nah . everything 's cool ... i took care of 'em .

rick 's got an important announcement to make .

i 'm glad you guys came by ... what 's the occasion ?

denmark makes great nautilus equipment .

when do the girls get to the party ?

yeah , man , he 's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks .

he and debbie stand outside the theater , which is a multi-plex cinema . fourteen movie theaters under one roof . prominent is a sign which reads : `` 24 hour 3d festival ! '' cole drags debbie into one of the theaters . the gang runs up to the theaters .

rick ... debbie is mine . she 'll always be .

the car for debbie ?

i 'm ready to make you another deal .

rick , i want to talk to you .

i want debbie .

the bachelor party 's upstairs . they made me get naked . they hung me from the window so high up it was so scary i fell down ...

i 've tried to change her mind .

not at all . we 're just finishing lunch .

cole , i 'm marrying rick .

and i want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment .

this is it , lady . last stop .

would n't think of it . because tomorrow ... we 're going to the chapel and we 're ...

the wedding , my parents , your family , our friends , my job , the future , our relationship , the caterers , my gown , your tuxedo , our honeymoon , the apartment , my shower , your bachelor party ...

oh , those . why do you ask ?

god , you 're a slob .

i 'm using the same caterer for the shower i had for our christmas party last year .

well ... hope she 'll be very happy .

give him the works .

jumbo , where the hell are the women ?

rick , i really think i 'm in love .

this place should have been wall to wall tits by now .

because i love her . what can i tell you ?

not one minute longer or milt will come for you .

big problem now . soon they go to customers .

it 's my fault . he 's dead because ... i left those drugs ...

you okay ?

i just want to be alone .

she hates me . it 's over . you 'll see , as soon as you get married , everything changes . you sure you want to go through with it , man ?

the thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck .

i 'm separated .

guess who 's here ? another surprise guest .

and here 's mike 's partner , in more ways than one . a gal who does n't think happiness ends with primates . the very lovely , miss desiree ...

what 's this ?

who was that ?

put it to you this way -- you 're gon na have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula , mister .

get a few drinks into me , we 'll dance and see what happens .

what the hell is that ?

thanks , stan , you 've been a lot of help .

nah , that 's okay . my brother has to look up old people 's asses all day long . let 's give him a break .

okay , rick , all finished . i ca n't wait for that bachelor party ... i need the action .

can you believe how perfect it fits ?

... what do you want me to do , stephen ? talk to me . what am i supposed to do ?

they were killing firemen , man . when sally showed me what was in swayzak 's files ... they were my friends , i had to do it . i had to do it for the department .

kind of an asshole , was n't he ?

that 's franny . she likes firemen .

it 's gon na flash , stevie . we got ta get behind it .

just come down , john . just --

do n't tell them about adcox ... do n't let 'em ...

what are we going to do about this ?

anything else ?

fuck you .

just leave me alone , okay ?

you okay ?

roll the hose .

yeah ... too bright ...

what you did was drop the ball , probie . get that right .

that was never proved .

it worked when you were in sixth grade .

i do n't have the slightest idea ...

do you miss it ? you seem like you do .

no , he 's more of a dinosaur . guy 's not a dummy , though . he 's juggling alot of balls on this one .

boy , rimgale 's as slow as a snail , is n't he ?

if you were n't at least the 300th person to ask me that , i 'd probably be pissed . boy , you sure know it 's a man 's world sometimes ...

well , if nothing else , it 's nice to know we can still be friends .

what ?

sorry , but it 's out of my hands . try again next year .

look , everybody remembers your old man . being his son , all you had to do was breathe to graduate here . dead hero father rule . but you blew us off . why should i take you back ?

did i say thanks ?

i do n't guess .

even if it was used to seal the air off , that does n't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft . a gun 's a helluva lot easier

trychticholorate . then swayzak can announce seagrave was a murder .

uh , i do n't think that 's in my contract ...

glass ?

-- shhh .

look , i knew your father , he had a helluva reputation on this job . but that do n't mean you get any slack . swayzak sends you down here , okay , i got ta eat you , that 's the rules and i got nothing to say about that . but swayzak or no , you live with me . step out of line , and i do n't care who knows you , i 'll swing the hammer . you think you 're the first ?

sean , come on out , man . what , you forget your favorite uncle ?

'bout written you off . how long have you been in town ?

hi , helen . man , you look great .

what ?

y'know what stephen said to me , right when all the shit was coming hard ? `` you never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you 're just gon na do this job or be great at it '' .

completely out of control .

okay .

yeah ... i just thought i should say , i do n't know , something .

stephen , i 'm kinda busy here , can we talk about this later ?

that 's your job .

you like everybody , ronald .

how ya doin ' , ronald . staying comfortable ?

got a cause ?

just catch the son of a bitch .

no marty , i do n't .

yeah .

christ ! shit ! i could kill them all with my bare hands .

that stuff 'll kill you quick , man .

let me think about it .

hey , man . do n't give me that bullshit . do n't pussy-out on me . the mets are a fucking lock . i wan na make some money .

i also thought of that bread , father . and of that night six days ago when the mother superior died , and i kept the cool , damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist . father , what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve god ?

we know . we know . yo , check it , my black brothers , we ca n't let this slide . not this injustice . nah , no way . dem ' two real coons iz ill .

b-l-a-k it is .

alright . here we go . let 's go niggers ! let 's go niggers !

that'swhati'mtalkin'bout ! that'swhati'mtalkin'bout ! i want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of mantan - the new millennium minstrel show .

so are you telling me that you would n't even introduce me to delacroix or set up a meeting ? i 'm talking 'bout me , your only brother , ya own flesh and blood , hook a brother up , youknowwhati'msayin ' .

please .

hook you up ? the mau-mau 's ? you must be smoking . why in the world would i want to hook up a bunch of red , black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies ?

i 'm not callin you big black africa . mommy and daddy named you julius .

i did n't mean to scare you like that .

and what are the mau-mau 's going to do for us today ?

what 's your name ?

sloan is all 'dat . i try her . i 'm a tri-sexual .

gentlemen , the show , our show will be satirical . you know what that is , do n't you ? trust me on this one .

different .

no offense .

if it 's not too much trouble could you order us some food ?

yo , you got ta show some patience . you want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you 're an overnight sensation . son , there is no such thing .

did we get our bill yet ?

hurry up , i wan na watch hbo .

my tap shoes .

funnier to who and at who 's expense ? dunwitty , when negroes start to run amok , the boycotts , when the demostrations commence , i 'm giving them your home address . let 's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in greenwich , connecticut .

calm down , please .

derrick coleman , he possessed all the talent in the world , coulda , shoulda , been a great ballplayer but alas d.c. did n't want it bad enough . delacroix , do you want it ? bad enough to kill for it ? do you want it that much .

besides , what does he know about negroes ?

i strongly feel that a negro should direct this . this kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm . one misstep and we 're doing `` amos and andy . '' only a negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain .

i 've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right . in my previous work it 's been all surface , superficial . i have never really dug deep . not anymore . as mark twain fully understood satire is the way . race has always been a hot button in this country 's history and it needs to be pushed harder . if we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony . it 's about promoting racial healing .

we 're all happy to be here and i 'm going to paint a picture for you .

i 'm sorry about my blowup but i have to have a whipping boy every meeting .

do you know what c.p . time is ?

let 's get him over to the bed .

three nights charleston , south carolina .

enough about me , what 's happening with you ?

daddy , it ca n't be just because of that . there had to be other factors .

my game is still strong . no viagra for me , do n't need no chemicals . just my tonic .

daddy , she 's younger than me .

i want to speak with you .

what do you want ?

that 's why it will be so much fun .

we both lied to him .

it hit me like a ton of bricks .

hope the same thing does n't happen to me . that 's some big shoes to fill .

of course i 'm happy for you . you 've worked very hard for your success .

i 'm doing okay . been reading about your show , it 's all over everywhere . i watched it 's all over everywhere . i watched it once . i thought you said there would be no buffoonery .

he 's performing at some place outside of richmond , virginia .

he wants you to come and see him .

i know what 's on my birth certificate . you heard from daddy ?

son , peerless is your name . now you might be one of these hollywood types , change your name and all that but peerless dothan is on your birth certificate .

this is a tv show , not a music video .

i envy you . that 's the way i want to feel about my work .

what do you mean ?

you 've never had any formal training , either ?

do n't you feel that is a simplistic retort ?

yo , tavis , check it out . this is the two-one , the 21st century and it 's all about the money . like my man mase says , `` it 's all about the benjamins . ''

let 's jump right into it . your show has sparked a world of controversy , provoked a tone of dialogue . how do you see all of this ?

ai n't jemima on the pancake box ?

i slept too near where i fell out .

... yes she did .

... no , she did n't ...

... aconite get it dat cheap .

i thought you got rid of ...

mantan , way too short , too tight . get her one of dose ...

too bad . how 'bout a dress ?

oh her .

the one with da big ...

give or cousins some of dem educated feets .

this is my best friend sleep ' n eat .

i know i wo n't be your puppet .

oh , you gon na make me say it .

stop playing me sloan .

you leave something out ?

gots no intention of ending up broke .

are you trying to rap to me ?

that is none of your business .

not yet , but i believe he intends to .

this may be a very good inn for germany , but it would not pass in old ireland . corbach is only a league off , let us push on for corbach .

she took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband . she is now mrs. john best .

a man of honor dies , but never apologizes . i 'll see the captain hanged before i apologize .

i hope to spoil this sport , and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully 's body .

that 's a very handsome sword you have there .

the meeting is arranged . captain best is waiting for you now .

mark this , come what will of it , i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy dugan . i 'll follow him if it 's into the church , and meet him there . i 'll have his blood , or he shall have mine . will you take my message to him , and arrange the meeting ?

ten thousand ? but the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand .

i have orders to gag your honor if you cry out , and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not .

certain ?

i risk nothing , for i am certain to kill him .

gentlemen , i wish you a good day . will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning , and tell my man there to send my baggage on to three kings at dresden ?

that is a trifle strong .

my lady cosgrove 's relationship with me was a singular one . her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me . we would quarrel for a fortnight , then we should be friends for a month together sometimes . one day , i was joking her , and asking her whether she would take the water again , whether she had found another lover , and so forth . she suddenly burst out into tears , and , after a while , said to me :

my husband has convinced me of the contrary .

be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are ?

what ! you have not met a man worthy of your attention ?

not even that .

what , with me on the pillion ? would you kill poor me ?

but you refused me , dorothy .

i had not been in the room five minutes before i was engaged for every single set .

i accept , but i insist on a wager . the loser must do whatever the winner pleases .

all the same , you must name an amount .

the prince left him only that choice .

in so far as i can tell these things -- no . i believe the chevalier won the money fairly .

o'higgins ... mohawk o'higgins .

mister bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life , and meditated a separation , in which case , she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance , and subject them , at any rate , to a doubtful and expensive litigation . they were quite insistent on this point , and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship 's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital .

well , we 'll just have to wait and see , wo n't we ?

come , come , sir . i am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool .

well , why not a milkmaid 's daughter ? no man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife 's sake ; on the contrary , if he selects the animal properly , he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure , but a comfort in his hours of annoyance . for instance , i have got the gout ; who tends me ? a hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power . my wife never comes near me . what friend have i ? none in the wide world . men of the world , as you and i are , do n't make friends , and we are fools for our pains .

indeed , you are right , sir . look at me . marriage has added forty years to my life . i am dying , a worn-out cripple , at the age of fifty . when i took off lady cosgrove , there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself . fool that i was ! i had enough with my pensions , perfect freedom , the best society in europe -- and i gave up all these , and married and was miserable . take a warning from me , mr. roderick , and stick to the trumps . do anything , but marry .

charming schuvaloff .

it was the grenade you fucking idiot . look at him !

i do n't know !

we found him like this --

he 's telling the truth up to a point ...

i promised them i 'd ask you where west and the others are ...

and the bodies ?

oh , you do n't ? what else do you have on me ? you have n't found any bodies yet , have you ?

you saved kendall 's life --

of course --

yeah , we know , pike did .

did kendall tell you about the px ?

i 'm serious --

and those were the guys who went on the exercise with you ?

is that what i did , now ? and of course , you can prove all of it .

the creek bed --

your weapons , sergeant .

what the fuck is going on ?

west ... he 's dead .

there 's no time to think , ray , we got ta get out of here ! you untie me , we grab the guns , get kendall and nunez , and make a run for it --

you saw west , right ? how was he killed ?

becoming a morphine addict during basic ai n't exactly something you want to broadcast . only mueller and childs know .

mueller .

ray , this is my life here . i ai n't gon na pretend i 'm not happy west is gone , but you know i could n't have done this . it 's not in me .

why ?

where are they !

what happened to `` degrees '' ?

my , my , my , how did things turn so hostile so quickly ? if i did n't know better , i 'd say you two were out to get me .

that 's preposterous --

west had a partner . someone who knew how to get things done .

if you let him testify then it would have all come out . west was supposed to take care of it out there , shut nunez up and then disappear . but it got messy and people got killed . so you called your old pal tom hardy , figuring if worse came to worse , he 'd cover for you .

maybe . but it 's my fault and i 'll carry it .

nevertheless what ' ? kendall will testify and that 'll be enough .

without the body we have no physical proof . we need a confession .

who killed pike ?

that bad ?

no death certificates . no crime .

you know , you never told me why you left the army .

now i go home , get drunk , and try and forget this ever happened .

so it 's a good plan but it goes wrong ; mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy , which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story --

i do n't think that has anything to do with --

we 're in the middle of a murder case --

something like that .

he 's in interrogation ?

christ ... remind me to thank bill for mentioning that on the phone --

levi ? who names their kid levi --

hostile and uncooperative .

so you took off your shirt ?

so you framed him . the same way childs was going to frame pike .

who , levi --

wait --

no , but it got you interested , did n't it ? got you to dig . inspired ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they did n't belong .

we 've been making progress , i see .

what the fuck are you doing ?

you never told me why you got kicked out of ...

it 's too neat .

he asked to see a policeman , we 're getting him a policeman .

sir , yes , sir !

there 's only one i want .

that would explain the indigestion .

this town is everything a man could ask for . and if i were to end up here , i 'd consider myself lucky . but the fact is , i 'm not ready to end up anywhere .

the poet ? what ever happened to him ?

yes .

fine , i 'm doing it .

a thousand times . he caught an uncatchable fish .

go .

i 'm sorry . have i offended you ?

i suspect it will hurt a lot .

you 're pretty good at arithmetic .

you do n't need a picture . just look up handsome in the dictionary .

terrible for her , but think about me , young boy with that kind of power . was n't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said , `` your grampa is going to die . '' well , i ran right back to my parents . my father said , no , gramps is fine , but i could see there was trepidation . and true enough , that next morning my grampa was dead .

you say ...

i have been nothing but myself since the day i was born . and if you ca n't see that , it 's your failing , not mine .

it would kill you , huh ?

there was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when i came out of this coffee shop near the office .

am i ?

no dad , they do n't . i do not like the story . not anymore , not after a thousand times . i know all the punchlines , dad . i can tell them as well as you can . for one night , one night in your entire life , the universe does not revolve around edward bloom . it revolves around me and my wife . how can you not understand that ?

go out with me .

this is why you do n't show work in progress .

is he going to be okay ?

what is `` true ? '' i 've never heard my father say a single true thing .

mmm .

that 's because most of it never happened .

it 's bad .

mom , do you want some time with dad ?

that 's okay ?

did you and dad have any other property ?

i do n't know if you 've seen it , but josephine has some photos in the most recent newsweek .

how much time does he have left ?

he 's impossible . he wo n't eat . and because he wo n't eat , he gets weaker . and because he 's weaker , he does n't want to eat .

you did n't need to do that . you just did n't .

yeah . it was quite good actually . some bits i really liked .

those are n't presents . that 's normal friendship stuff

do you like it ?

we 'll stop then .

hello .

this is sensitive . your car . lovely car . does n't necessarily give the right impression .

he says you are very sad ridiculous man . i do n't agree of course . and that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute . nadia is a prostitute . i 'm sorry .

put the fucking kettle down .

what was that ?

`` i have these uh ... '' she explains to you ... `` when i was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses . '' like ... i do n't know the word . like for watching uh ... for watching the birds .

what ?

so ?

maybe you will find out .

except for small eyes .

i smoke more these days . i smoke more when i 'm unhappy .

i 'm trying to quit .

do you know if it 's a boy or a girl ?

yeah . he 's a smashing bloke .

i think it 's my safest bet , do n't you ?

sometimes neither .

and . it 's wrong .

why not ?

he left me my passport and ticket . it 's pretty clear he wants to see me again .

i said i do n't have any .

what ?

so you 're just going to be vindictive

well as it turns out i did .

it 's makes it easier . okay .

unless . unless this is part of the routine . you get tied up , stick around , distract me , they both bust in and steal my cup of coffee .

also extraordinary things .

also you 're too valuable to experiment with .

why ?

the facts of life . i 'll be blunt . to make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system , at least by men , makers or not , it fatal . a coding sequence ca n't be revised once it 's established .

i think it 's the eyes .

i knew this would happen ! you 're like a lost puppy !

i ca n't help it . perry como always does this to me ! i just get so cranked !

he 'll catch him . hi . this is nina aron . i 've got a run away and i 'm going to need police assistance .

yes , i can tell that just looking around . `` boy ? '' did you say you were a `` country boy ? ''

`` hell up here ? '' honey , it 's been hell up here , down there and over yonder ! hell everywhere .

so ... you ... survived the blast , did you ?

to keep what 's up there from getting down here ! it 's not the radiation i 'm worried about .

amen .

well , i am the head of this household --

excuse me .

just open the door .

would you excuse me ?

you know , when we do go up ... i 'm going to miss this old place . how 'bout you , hon ?

yes ...

if we still have one .

oh , that 's just a bunch of baloney ! we never believed that in my family !

you bet .

hi .

no reason . well , it 's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off . so , you know , when the time is up , we 'll have to return to the surface using , you know , this back entrance . which is very nice because it has the service elevator !

calvin ? !

yes !

and i was wondering ... if ... if i could have a ...

hot dr. pepper ! your favorite !

then after that it 's safe .

the locks ?

rather safe than sorry . that 's my motto !

from the oddest place . his parent 's told him . i do n't think i got that memo .

yes , you do !

it 's not so much what you say but how you say it . women like men who are unpredictable .

um ... eve ?

just be yourself .

that 's what i 'm sensing .

exactly . you understand that , do n't you ? you have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that .

darlin ' , this is x-file stuff ! think about it ! the guy 's got all this easily negotiable property . he 's obviously setting something up very big . like a self-sustaining island off the coast of south america , for instance . or perhaps he 's the head of a cult that 's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco . i 've heard worse .

i miss those nice flower-power kids . how 'bout you ?

i 'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke !

i 'm sorry , i did n't ...

that 's for me to know and for you to find out . i 'll see you . i mean call you , okay ?

it 'll be okay . i do n't think you should wait out here though . i think you should go home . can you drive this car ?

first of all , we 're going to the slow club to see dorothy vallens . we 'll watch her for awhile . i 'd like to hear her sing anyway , and then also we 'll know she is there and not in her apartment .

i have to help out in my father 's hardware store . they 're giving me sort of my own hours for a while , which is nice .

yeah , i guess so . what are you going to do now that you 're home ?

you really do hear a lot , do n't you ?

she ai n't been around in weeks anyhow .

get a hold of yourself , man .

chest pocket . shit !

each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies .

a-fuckin'-men !

there he goes . okay , gentlemen . are we ready to bring this man into the light ? are we ready to truly do the work of the lord ?

holy shit . who ? how many ?

`` i 'm afraid we ca n't let that one go , ivan . ''

aaaww , shit ! ... evil woman !

oh , come on now rozengurtle . i was just tryin ' ta get a rise outta ya .

and it 's the same story over here . why the crossover ? theories .

fan-fuckin-tastic !

peeperman ? wrong ? what color was it ? ! ! !

your what ? ! your fuckin ' what ? !

rocco !

a guy went nuts over off of commonwealth today . shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight . fled the scene . do n't have much on him .

no way they could have seen it ?

it 's gon na look like the bad guys are killing each other .

now , what is this going to look like to those who do not know what i just told you ?

what about one guy with two guns ?

now stay with me , boys . what did they do to make two such identical wounds ? did one guy put him on his knees , pop a cap in , sit him back up and shoot him again the same way ? no . two men of similar height dropped this guy down , each put some iron to his head and boom ! that 's all she fuckin ' wrote !

they shot him at a downward angle . they put him on his knees .

the what man ?

what if it was just one guy with six guns ?

chief , what the fuck is this ?

we promise .

oh my god !

i 'm fuckin ' fine . catch you on the flip side .

who says that ? you could take credit on it .

do you think they would harm an innocent man , for any reason ?

has he now ?

have you no fear of god ?

i 'm rocco . i 'm the funny man . heee hee . i 'm so fuckin ' funny . hee hee .

gim me the fuckin ' thing . now sit the fuck down !

joey bevo said it was important . said i had to give it to him myself .

you 're kidding .

does it float ?

nothing .

i 'm not kidding .

you got to be kidding me .

i 'll see you there .

come on , kumar .

careful . check his pulse .

who did that ? what the fuck is that ?

what 's happening ? what 's going on ?

i 'm in position , scarecrow .

take your second position .

uh-huh ?

bird dog to scarecrow . bird dog to scarecrow .

what exactly is this place ? freezers ?

i know that . but --

that 's what she is !

our money situation is not good .

i 'm not . but there 's --

she does n't need to know .

i wish i 'd been there .

we said 48 hours .

right here .

yes ... it 's true .

but if it was n't for dignan i probably would of died .

he needs to hire an attorney .

can i get that credit card from you ?

what about what that guy said ?

anthony , give me the fucking gun !

loop around real fast .

i do n't appreciate you ridiculing me .

every valuable item in the house was on that list .

kind of . except we 've already got the keys .

he 's not there . huggie bear is n't in every single episode .

why 'd you want to help us ?

can i ask you something , mr. henry ?

hold it .

sure , sure . he 's a great person , and i 'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently . but i wonder if the kid has the goods up here .

technique . that 's right . seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control . seventy-five percent . do you believe that ?

you know , your form is for shit , but you 've got a hell of a talent .

nice to meet you .

temporarily .

hopscotch . the code name is hopscotch .

why do you say that ?

that 's pretty complicated for a senior prank .

well , i did n't mean to electrocute him . but the whole operation was my idea .

i 'm not playing any more golf .

there 's a million places to hide around here .

let them fight .

hector woud n't do anything .

in your backyard ? how do you protect them ?

were you born in mexico ?

how do you say nineteen ?

you 're anthony ?

we might have to take that chance . cause i feel pretty strongly about this .

that 's just what the da asked . crs is a disease where you ca n't remember shit .

applejack drove .

i 'm sorry , bob .

bullshit .

man , i do n't want to go into this .

it 's too bad about what happened on the road .

you do n't even know his name .

good luck , since i got the keys .

i was just going to use it to see how much i had .

since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house ? everybody has a scale .

what the fuck possessed you ?

i told you they were there .

was dignan screaming like , get me a bag !

i 'm putting a piece of tape on my nose .

it was an accidental . i do n't want to go into the details . it was just one of those senior pranks that did n't really go right . i mean , obviously , since swifty 's dead . that 's why anthony never graduated .

yeah , but what if some nut pulled gun on you ?

that 's your domain .

hang on . this is important , bob . anthony and i are responsible for the internal situation . the money and the people . you 're responsible for the external situation . the streets and the getaway .

i think we might of scared her .

what did i say ?

my brother .

yeah . hey , clay .

did you hear that ?

ground defense .

hand to hand combat ?

no , if i go out on this job , then it 's just another score by mr. henry . and i do n't see it like that . this is your job . your creation . i want you to try this .

i do n't know . are you in , anthony ?

dignan . good to see you . good to see you applejack . who are you ?

where did he go ?

how 's the weather down there ?

you like chicanos ?

what ?

the world needs dreamers , son .

leaving was a business decision . we 're both rich , come enjoy it .

neski was a roadblock . without me , there 's no company , no fortune . you owe me , uri . one last push .

and the landy woman ?

will it track back to us ?

there was a mistake .

you told me bourne was dead .

what ?

so what 's your theory ? conklin 's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name ? the man is dead .

... this is conklin 's computer .

he does . i 've been down to the archives . i have the files , ward .

i want to know about treadstone .

with all due respect , pam , i think you might 've wandered a little past your pay-grade .

lots of people ...

it was staged ?

i did my box work , but i wanted to show you before i showed landy . i came out here last night because none of this was making any sense . i mean , i 'm with you on this , conklin was a nut , but a traitor ? i just ca n't get there .

because you 're afraid !

it 's nice . does this picture mean anything to you ? hmm ?

jason . you know exactly what to do . that is your mission now .

god , i miss you . i do n't know what to do without you .

but you found another choice .

i warned them , marie . i told them to leave us alone .

if he crosses the bridge , it is .

where are you going ?

-- yeah -- one guy -- i do n't think he was ready --

-- where 's left to go ? --

back there -- at the corner -- hyundai -- silver --

why are you here , then ?

they know ! they know you were here . they know you killed these two guys . they know you and conklin had something on the side . they do n't know what it is , but they know !

thank you for your gift . i 'm sorry about marie .

-- kurt 's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --

still ...

it 's a lot of money , pam .

i 'm here . so is donnie and jack weller . we understand you 're using the full allocation for this buy ?

i 'm getting on a plane to berlin in 45 minutes , which means you are going to call me back in 30 , and when i ask you where we stand , i had better be impressed . my mobile number is ...

pamela landy , again . where do we stand ?

my brother and nephew perished two days ago , when their hay cart turned over .

what it means in england -- and in scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands . we were ambushed last night . but the scots dragged their dead away .

he has already agreed to come .

i will invade england . and defeat the english on their own ground .

you are surprised he would lie ? balliol was murdered in a church yesterday . you are longshanks ' new designate . you will be king .

what choice do they have ? now they must serve us or starve .

so the scots will have none of them , will they ? my armorers have already made a thousand .

while i am in france fighting to expand your future kingdom i learn that stirling castle is lost , our entire northern army wiped out ! and you have done nothing ? !

wallace 's ? for treason there is no trial . tomorrow he will be charged , then executed .

when will his trial be ?

the little cow is insane --

now , my flower , do you understand ?

nor i ! i want to live ! i want a home and children and peace . i 've asked god for those things . but he 's brought me this sword . and if he wills that i must lay it down to have what he wants for my country , then i 'll do that too .

you 'll move

how many ?

we do n't split up !

against thy king , thou vile fool ! hast thou anything to say ?

i ... accept your proposal !

did it work ?

i ca n't bear the thought of your torture . take it !

you will die ! it will be awful !

sir , i ... come to beg you to confess all , and swear allegiance to the king , that he might show you mercy .

no . but can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost ? or simply love me ... because i love you ?

war finds me willing . i know it wo n't bring back all i have lost . but it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own . for that we need a king . we need you .

i was going to show this to the principal , but i wanted to talk to you first .

the hemorrhaging ... the neural damage is irreparable . i 'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions .

no dances , just tell me .

evan wake up , oh please wake up !

you 'd be surprised how often they are .

unfortunately , we 've got nothing to work with . it 's harder playing detective now .

well , the good news is that the results are negative . i 've found no evidence in the way of lesions , hemorrhaging , tumors ...

anything .

just tell me that evan does n't have jason 's illness ...

come on , mom . just 'cause dad was my age when he started going crazy does n't mean that i 'm nuts .

cute , evan .

how long will i be in here ?

did da -- jason -- - get good grades ?

now your father may seem sleepy to you , but that 's just because of his medicine , okay ?

i get the point , kiddo . but i 'm not so bad , am i ?

thanks . do n't worry evan , you 'll have plenty of time .

righty-tighty , lefty-lucy .

we 're gon na be late again .

weirder than this ?

just tell me if anything weird happens .

straight up .

go on . nothing can hurt you . remember , this is only a movie . you 're completely safe .

dad lives here ?

get out . both of you .

what the fuck are you doing ?

this is bigger . seven years to the day . no blackouts .

get dressed , thumper , you 're taking me out for my birthday .

i do n't get it .

which is ?

i just thought you should know .

do you remember when i was a kid and i had those blackouts ?

different ? how ?

why 's that ?

you would n't believe me . i mean , people always say , `` you would n't believe me '' , but in this case , it 's not even worth trying .

i ca n't put my finger on it , but everything 's a bit off . even the dinner tonight . it was beautiful , but ...

might ' a been nice . like this is gon na do any good . maybe one of the frat guys has a gun .

go on . sit down .

i do n't understand , where are you taking me ?

where ... where are my clothes ?

it 's just ... did he ... what happened in the basement ?

wow . that must 've taken some courage .

i 've stopped a hundred times .

i 'm going to state now . things are going okay . i guess . mom 's good ...

duck , here they come .

i ca n't believe tommy 's still pissed at me . he knows i 'm moving away , right ?

we should go soon . if dad catches us smoking down here , we 're dead .

that 's dangerous ! you could blow your hands off !

i was praying this curse would have ended with me .

it 's okay . i wo n't bite . you 've seen pictures of me , right ?

you 're kidding . are these the answers ? !

and you are ... ?

come on , go on ...

freeze ! no `` worm-boy '' . no `` mr. worm , '' and no `` worm-master-general ! '' once you get a nickname like that you ca n't shake it . and i do n't want everyone thinking i 've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something , okay ?

shhh . i need to concentrate on the blockbuster if i 'm gon na destroy it .

gee , thanks friend .

sorry , mrs. t. he 's been out of sorts lately .

right , evan . i believe you just said `` sick fuck . ''

what 's wrong with you ? !

tommy , i 'm bored shitless over here . what 's up already ?

fat little baby , crying for mommy .

aw , hey now , that was a compliment .

yeah , you do that , lenny .

-- he 's just a lucky guy .

yes , well , everybody in casablanca has problems . yours may work out . you 'll excuse me .

oh , yes , please .

oh , yes .

he tells me he can give us an exit visa , but we have no money .

yes , but we have not much money , and traveling is so expensive and difficult . it was much more than we thought to get here . and then captain renault sees us and he is so kind . he wants to help us .

yes , monsieur .

such a bargain . but that is your decision ?

thank you , but i hardly think --

excuse me , but you look like a couple who are on their way to america .

i want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance . it might attract the police .

maybe i wo n't have to . a bribe has worked before . in the meantime , everybody stays on salary .

it shall not happen again , monsieur .

my dear rick , when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy ?

suppose we do .

he is a difficult customer , that rick . one never knows what he 'll do or why . but it is worth a chance .

yes , something .

i observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man , monsieur . i am moved to make one more suggestion , why , i do not know , because it can not possibly profit me , but , have you heard about signor ugarte and the letters of transit ?

as leader of all illegal activities in casablanca , i am an influential and respected man . it would not be worth my life to do anything for monsieur laszlo . you , however , are a different matter .

and you never will . but i 've got a job to do , too . where i 'm going you ca n't follow . what i 've got to do you ca n't be any part of . ilsa , i 'm no good at being noble , but it does n't take much to see that the problems of three little people do n't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world . someday you 'll understand that . now , now ...

richard , victor thinks i 'm leaving with him . have n't you told him ?

huh . but it 's still a story without an ending . what about now ?

put them on the table .

please . please listen to me . if you knew what really happened , if you only knew the truth --

do i have to hear again what a great man your husband is ? what an important cause he 's fighting for ?

i know how you feel about me , but i 'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important .

i told you this morning you 'd come around , but this is a little ahead of schedule . well , wo n't you sit down ?

did you run out on me because you could n't take it ? because you knew what it would be like , hiding from the police , running away all the time ?

yes , that 's very pretty . i heard a story once . as a matter of fact , i 've heard a lot of stories in my time . they went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs , `` mister , i met a man once when i was a kid , '' it 'd always begin . huh . i guess neither one of our stories was very funny . tell me , who was it you left me for ? was it laszlo , or were there others in between ? or are n't you the kind that tells ?

with the whole world crumbling , we pick this time to fall in love .

say goodnight to sam for me .

-- you do n't even have to say it . i 'll believe . goodnight , dear .

no , victor , there is n't .

yes , victor , i was .

he suggested i ask you .

no , ilsa , i wo n't let you stay here . you must get to america . and believe me , somehow i will get out and join you .

please , ilsa , do n't be hasty .

-- this is mr. laszlo .

yes .

sam ?

yes , i get the point .

had a close one , eh ?

what of it ?

and i congratulate you .

how do you do ?

you wo n't dare to interfere with me here . this is still unoccupied france . any violation of neutrality would reflect on captain renault .

herr laszlo , you have a reputation for eloquence which i can now understand . but in one respect you are mistaken . you said the enemies of the reich could all be replaced , but there is one exception . no one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape .

you will give us the names ?

captain renault , i am under your authority . is it your order that we come to your office ?

but everybody 's having such a good time .

we are concerned about more than casablanca . we know that every french province in africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance , waiting , perhaps , for a leader .

but we must n't underestimate american blundering . i was with them when they `` blundered '' into berlin in 1918 .

mademoiselle .

rick is completely neutral about everything . and that takes in the field of women , too .

may i recommend veuve cliquot '26 , a good french wine .

i 'll make the arrangements right now with laszlo in the visitor 's pen .

i am shocked , shocked to find that gambling is going on in here !

huh ?

he 'll take one .

-- stop it . he escaped from a concentration camp and the nazis have been chasing him all over europe .

rick , that is the first time i have ever seen you so impressed .

how observant you are . as a matter of fact , i wanted to give you a word of advice .

what , again ?

rick , there 's going to be some excitement here tonight . we are going to make an arrest in your cafe .

i was misinformed .

waters ? what waters ? we 're in the desert .

the clipper to america .

you know , i think now i shall pay a call on yvonne , maybe get her on the rebound , eh ?

put that phone down !

you 'll excuse me , gentlemen . your business is politics . mine is running a saloon .

do n't be a fool . you ca n't get away .

i do n't want them here overnight .

i forgot . you never drink with ... i 'll have another , please . you despise me , do n't you ?

you said it ! here 's looking at you , kid .

no , i do n't .

no .

sam , ferrari wants you to work for him at the blue parrot .

six kilometers . four miles .

it took this test package thirty-two hours to get from seattle to st. petersburg , a distance of nine thousand miles . and then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in st. petersburg to here , a distance of , what --

what 's so damn funny ?

thank you for fucking up my life .

the sea is lovely , dark and deep .

no !

i 'm lost . goodbye .

you fucking bleeding heart , you kill or you die .

get water !

no more water , you said .

feels so good to lie here .

just sit here , i 'll get us some lunch .

our apologies that it never made it to the recipient .

oh ? you 've tried ?

yeah . a long time ago .

had a package to deliver .

i had to come . to be sure you were okay .

great . really .

that 's what i told the fish i caught . but i ate them anyway .

cliches , mainly . do n't take anyone for granted . do n't sweat the small stuff . live each day like it 's your last .

i know .

no , it was great . maybe a little overkill --

a ring . i wanted a ring .

let me guess , russia came up ?

hey , be nice to it , it 'll be nice to you .

but all that 's behind me . i 'm fine now .

dehydration . vitamin deficiency . protein deficiency . any or all of the above .

yeah .

sixty three pounds consumed per capita , up from twenty seven in 1960. going to pass beef . chicken 's global . no religious taboos . you do n't see your hindus and your muslims boycotting poultry .

bless us o lord , and these thy gifts , which we are about to receive , from thou bounty , through christ the lord . amen .

roger got me on . i was n't doing anything , and -- but you 're back , you 're really back . i would have come to memphis , but --

oh no , the prodigal son 's home . we bring out the store bought .

mom , this is a farm . we 've got real strawberries growing outside , we 've got real cream .

what happened to your pants ?

what about the sender ?

okay . after three years the ptr reverts to tape storage , which is okay because we access it through the cpc . here it is . ten packages from the same sender . baku . delhi . st. petersburg . the guy was a real road warrior . this package was kuala lampur . no activity in his account after this package . no forwarding addresses after k.l .

who 's in charge then , where is chinn ?

take your time .

you 've been over the line and you came back . you 've been saved , hallelujah !

how about we go somewhere else ?

you beat 'em to shit , pal ! jesus !

talk is cheap . are we on or not ?

i was making a point .

oh my , yes ! this is a *far* superior taste -- and crisp , too ! you know , so many apples are disappointingly mealy . i wonder of most of the apples in my life were n't meant for pies !

you *invented* him ! you 've completely made his up !

it 's that mrs. goodhall you have to be careful of , wilbur .

you were n't dreaming about me .

better than i can !

i know who you mean . i think about leaving here , but not to find *them* .

but you 've studied with the old man for *years* !

should n't we tell homer ?

why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him ?

i 'll tell them fuzzy was adopted .

how about him not needin ' the friggin ' compass ! how about that ?

you say that as though it 's some awful thing ! i never stopped loving wally !

please do n't ...

you got up ! you *did* something ! if you keep this up , you might be in danger of making a *decision* !

if you 're trying to be funny , homer ...

we have to wait and see . i think that , for *everything* in life , you have to wait and see .

not with the right girl you would n't .

and what did she die of , exactly ?

but you looked as if you liked it .

people watched the movies in their cars ?

a movie *outside* ?

where 's mandalay ?

two .

yes , i *have* !

he *loved* it ! did n't you ?

so here is my candidate . what do you think ?

did you grow up around here ?

is *your* father dead ?

that 's why kong loves her !

this is all normal . do n't worry . the abortion procedure ... it affects you . it 's the ether , too . it 'll take a little time .

i think i 'd probably like the apple business .

i 'm sorry . they 're not used to seeing a car like this .

mr. rose , i 'm in the *doctor* business . if you want , i can help you . you do n't have to go anywhere .

cider do n't have no taste till later in october -- it 's too watery now , when we 're usin ' just them early macs and them gravensteins . you do n't get no *good* cider till you 're pickin ' them golden delicious and them winter bananas , them baldwins and them russerts ...

homer , you the only one who 's read them rules , so you the only one who feels like he 's doin ' somethin ' wrong .

okay , he 's just a wilbur then .

yes , for both .

yeah , well ... you could move on with *us* , man ! you could move on somewhere *warm* !

thanks , guys ... i 'd like to go with you . but i 've got to move on .

we heard that one already , homer .

how long 's this been going on , muddy ?

*happy* ! what are you thinkin ' ? how am i supposed to take care of a baby ! i ca n't have a baby .

so what ?

jack , you got ta watch your language 'round my daughter .

do you know him ?

what have you two been doin ' to make it look so nice ?

it look nicer then home !

do n't this place look like home ?

*you* taught her , i suppose ...

tell him what you want , muddy -- *you* is the crew boss today .

i ai n't your business no more , daddy . please let me go .

where do you think you 're going ?

that 's right -- that sounds like trouble to me .

she 's about the most beautiful girl i ever seen -- i do n't know if she 's the nicest .

oh . well , thanks for the drink .

brutal day . they say the streets are lined with money down here , but i guess you have to know the secret handshake . what are you drinking ?

big.com . that internet thing .

yeah , but come on ... all i get to do is cry and get insulted .

bullshit ! you were scared , jake ! you lost your nerve ! you lost your confidence ! you were n't being noble . you were n't trying to save anybody but yourself ! admit it .

is that what it was , jake ? was it love ?

but there were other factors .

is n't it always ?

it 's all about the money , is n't it ?

things are probably going to end badly for you , jake .

the cash we fleeced off of him was collection money . he was supposed to take that money and give it to the king earlier yesterday like he does every thursday . 'cept this time , he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the king 's money back before any body says `` boo . ''

so far , masters of our own demise . what bank are you with ?

we 'll use the euc .

when ?

but you wo n't get that splatter effect .

i told you , use less powder .

i think i just broke my hand .

i need you to stake me . i ca n't do it without it . it 's just a couple hundred grand . taken out of our cut when we 're done .

i need you to stake me .

let me repeat -- why not ?

i ca n't do that .

of course , your line of work 's only as good as the people you find .

special agent gunther moonan . ring a bell ?

no , i want my cut !

after glenn was finished , he gave me a couple of valiums and i went home . the next day , i finished my shift and met him around back , like we always did . i stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest . three or four times .

yeah , the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me .

he was n't my boyfriend . i had a boyfriend at the time ... what was his name ? anyway , glenn was like thirty . i was only fifteen . but he was a nice guy . real sweet . liked to talk . we used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to morrisey or some stupid shit like that .

sounds respectable .

how do you deal with --

good quality porn has it 's place in the world .

are you asking me if i have something to prove ?

i got ta go get a haircut .

uh-huh .

uh ... everything okay ?

you 're just going to have to trust me .

why ?

hey , i got it ! take some mental notes . you just might learn something here .

we had to see what your deal was . i 'm just a little superstitious .

you interested in a little work ?

that 's not --

but if you wan na talk about bad luck ...

is it all fugasi ?

yeah , well we 're still a little young for albany state prison . are you pissed about al ? i 'm pissed too , but i 'm not like `` twenty-five to life '' pissed .

yeah , well we never had this kind of problem before .

yeah , or d , it 's a dumb fucking idea ...

good point .

uh ...

what do we need another shill for ?

how do you know the king 's going to let you walk ?

just mail it to the hospital . mr. king , please . it 's regarding an accounting problem . yes ... correct ... i know where it is . that will be fine . thank you .

he 'll find us . we go talk to him .

sorry . i 'm just ... look what they did to him . right in the middle of his egg-foo-young .

tick-tock ...

what was it ?

i 'm sorry . nothing under pearson .

he got caught ! your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched !

so that 's it , huh ? you get the cops to give you a safe ride .

you going to have the time ?

so what do you want ?

this guy must have been a real pain in your dick .

what do you get out of it ?

whoa , whoa ... there he is .

ah , we all say that . but if we hate it , why do we do it ?

i 'll take you up on that .

i 'm bella .

i found her in bed with someone .

she went back to south africa .

never . why do you ask ?

it 's beautiful . thank you .

no . answer it !

now wait a minute . what 's so hopeful about your job ? spending the day catching poor people stealing . you said yourself the organised gangs get away with it . at least in the casino everybody gets caught . rich or poor , the odds are the same . it 's all relative .

i do n't give a fuck about the sex . most men 'll fuck a lamppost . he 's just a miserable zombie . is that the way you feel now ? is that what 's happened to you ?

well , that 's my poor upbringing . i did n't go to no private school . i have n't got no class . i want to live with a writer . not a fucking croupier . i do n't even know what the word means . croupier .

are you drunk ?

do n't play the cop with me , marion .

where 've you been ? i 've got to give evidence in court at nine .

are you trying to read my palm ?

450 ? what did you do , just walked in and said i want to be a croupier ? do n't you need training ?

i 've got a job .

you want me drunk ?

no , no . i 'm not ready for you . there 's some vodka in the freezer .

i 've set this up for you . call the golden lion and ask for mr reynolds , he 's the manager . i do n't know him personally , but i 've spoken to his boss . do n't say no , jacko . give yourself a break .

yes . i 'm all over that now . jack , hold on a minute . there 's someone here who wants to talk to you ...

sun city . i 've been meaning to call you for months .

jack ! it 's jani .

is it yes ?

what for ?

did they tell you to sleep with me ?

these people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after . they want someone they can be sure of , an honest dealer . that 's the point . not all dealers are honest . mr reynolds will never suspect you .

what ten thousand pounds ?

you wo n't be committing a crime . the man will cheat , you 'll just be doing your job , that 's all .

robbery 's not criminal ?

i do n't have any money . switches on the light . jani is looking distressed .

i 'll watch .

he does n't gamble .

do you believe in astrology ?

and the lies . gamblers are born liars .

no , no . i come every couple of years . i always think i 'm going to stay . i 'm from cape town originally

ross .

are you going to put a spell on me ?

if i see you do it again , i 'll report it .

i 'm going over the river . i 'll give you a lift if you like .

take your time . two weeks . three if you need it . we 'll pay you sick leave . i do n't want to lose you . you 're a good man . here ...

he 's paying out in stacks of 25 .

he 's a good customer .

all right , mr reynolds .

this is n't south africa . we 'd know , because someone would report it . believe me , someone always does .

ever ?

not with your own cloth . besides , your pockets will be stitched .

i do n't think so .

where 's the magnet ?

we tried . but there was n't enough business . the punters like company .

i hope it 's not the oven again .

i read that with a quantum increase of seven .

it 's a goddamn wild goose chase . remember when commander powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the magellanic cloud ?

well , i show a 95 % probability of sentient life in the horsehead nebula ...

the only thing which exists is myself .

therefore , i shall ignore you .

detonation in twenty minutes .

to explode , of course .

why do n't you have more time ?

this is fun .

-- automatic channels open --

veil nebula .

come on , doolittle , give it a name .

your ghf reading is minus fifteen .

i said i 'm trying to reach talby . something 's wrong with the damn intercom . i need a last-minute diameter approximation .

ah , what 'd you say , pinback ?

bomb must have gone off inside the ship . nothing we can do about it now . hey , it looks like ... the skipper . he made it . commander powell made it !

well , i 'm in the emergency air lock and --

you know what i think about , talby ?

they are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years . the phoenix asteroids ... from what i 've heard , doolittle , they glow ... glow with all the colors of the rainbow . nobody knows why . they just glow as they drift around the universe . imagine all the sights they 've seen in the time they 've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars , things we 'll never see . the universe is alive , doolittle . i thought it was all empty , but it is n't . in between the stars , it 's seething with light and gasses and dust . there are little pebbles drifting around , planets no one on earth has ever seen ... no one but the phoenix asteroids ...

commander ? are you still there ?

sorry .

tell me , doolittle , how are the dodgers doing ?

what ?

mr. sonrisa saw you on the cameras . he wants you to come see him .

no .

justine was not an unwilling participant .

unless you wan na end up in jail , let me and kendra handle the cops .

no time .

what ? where 're we going ?

it 's a sweep . c'mon .

every week .

thanks , it 's starting to kick in . i feel almost human .

like i said -- this is n't my regular line of work so i 'm making it up as i go .

soon , baby .

mommy , where are you ?

no ...

but why ca n't we stay here ?

i do n't want to move away .

civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes . but logan and max , with a song in their hearts are gon na march into battle to keep that from happening .

maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe , sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation . but the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden . was n't s'posed to , but it did . and it 's back to the law of the jungle . you got your predators and you got your victims .

deeds , not words . i need your help .

they 've lost track of me and i plan to keep it that way .

i already do n't like the sound of this .

your help .

like extra virgin olive oil , the best of the best .

i do n't know what kind of game you 're playing here but i 'm out because you are a whack-job .

you 'd think a guy who 's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl .

you 're that nervous , you 're welcome to stay here .

it was open .

is the social studies class over for today ?

you accept the way things are , you 're an active participant in making it worse .

so , what , you just like the sound of your own voice ?

we did n't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night .

no , because it 's the egyptian goddess bast .

guess it was n't the pizza delivery guy .

none .

max something . i got no clue where she stays .

this is not a place you wan na go .

look , i do n't know what you want --

you said you knew where my fiance was the other night .

who are you ?

who is it ?

zero ... c'mon , dan i do n't have all day .

your fiance has four previous wives . his m.o . is to clean 'em out and take off . which is what you oughta do .

nothing on hannah ?

he says he got it from a woman . does n't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove .

only one i can think of .

what guys do . 'nother order .

you get it when i get her .

true , but --

no , i 'm serious . that psycho got exactly what she deserved ... yes .

you do n't .

-- a philandering pig .

she 's as much as said so . but she does n't want to share her toy with anyone else ... it 's just an ego thing with her .

a toy ?

does this person have a name ?

i do n't see how you cheating on natalie involves me .

catch you back at the wall .

theo 's dead .

tell him i took the day off 'cause i was n't feeling so hot .

i want you on call here .

he 's a little spoiled , but i know he does .

well . obviously no one you have to worry about ... woody .

who 's whiskey dick ?

i 'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you 'd get in a position and spend some time on me .

you 're too kind . i 'm amanda .

save your money , stud muffin . the lady at the end of the bar sends her love .

plenty , but it was all bad .

any luck ?

nah . could n't be .

sunday , but ...

are you gettin ' wise with me ?

hey , disco dude , it 's cool ...

sorry , man , no can do . but i 'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy .

i 'm sorry , guys . i thought it was a nice thing to do .

guys , guys ! come on , if this is anyone 's fault , it 's mine . i was the one who grabbed trip 's jacket by mistake . it 's my fault and i apologize .

just check whatever you were wearing last night . now !

you 're a smart boy , jeremiah . and so handsome .

but , mom !

the chinese have a proverb : `` that which appears too good to be true , usually is . '' there 's got ta be a catch .

trip , it 's not the end of the world , okay ? quit acting all squeezed out .

poor , jam , man . imagine having to stash your kiss records inside carly simon album covers . no question , mrs. bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell .

not if i shoot first !

gim me your gun , boy !

could these wormholes appear in nature ?

like a spear that comes out of your stomach ?

the basic principles of time travel are there . so you have the vessel and the portal . and the vessel can be anything . most likely a spacecraft .

theoretically .

i 'm telling mom .

did you tell them that i flooded the school ?

yeah . tell me why you 're wearing that stupid bunny suit .

what 'd you do , donnie ? what 'd you do !

i do n't wan na talk about it .

darko cheats death ! man ... you 're famous ! i called you , like , a jillion times last night !

is that a cellar door ?

why ? is this about the book ?

and inside these glasses are these slide photographs . and each photograph is of something peaceful ... or beautiful . whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside .

the old crazy woman who lives off old gun road .

yeah . and right now there 's some fat guy over there watching us .

i always wanted it to be at a time when ... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be .

babies cry because they 're afraid of the dark . and because they have no memories ... for all they know ... every night could be the last forever . like , perpetual darkness .

well ... maybe someone is , like ... giving you these dream steroids . and sleepwalking ... is someone showing you the way .

it 's a good thing the school was flooded today .

do n't knock soap . without it , disease would spread rapidly . if we ran out ... you and i would never live to see the year 2000 .

you mean soap ?

no , a year of partying is enough . she 'll be going to harvard this fall .

you 're my only son ...

it was great . we had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime . and then during show-and- tell , my stuffed walrus was a big hit .

that 's bullshit . you 're a good teacher .

well ... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds . when they flood the house . that like ... destruction is a form of creation . so the fact that they burn the money is ... ironic . they just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart . they want to change things .

goodbye , dr. thurman .

they ... did n't buy me what i wanted for christmas that year .

yes .

and when i clap my hands together twice , you will wake up . do you understand ?

and they grow out of our stomachs ?

i think that frank wants me to go to this woman . she wrote a book about time travel . frank asked me if i believed in time travel . that ca n't just be a random coincidence . my dad almost hit her with the car the other day , and she said the creepiest thing . she said that every living creature on this earth dies alone .

what about your family , donnie ?

do you think a lot about girls ?

i got in . i 'm going to harvard .

if you think michael dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out , then i think you 're misinformed .

but now you ca n't go .

the pta is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school 's curriculum .

mr. cole ... not only am i a teacher ... but i am also a parent of a middlesex child . therefore , i am the only person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge .

so , uh , i -- i 'm not really busy friday . i just said that -- y'know .

here , i 'll take it . it 's my job .

hi .

hi ...

why do n't you paint a big red target on your ass , loretta .

are we on `` cops '' again ?

it smells funny . like gasoline .

the important thing is that we have a winner ...

correction . this spunky monkey on my right is terry macey . and we are your minnesota american teen princess state board .

this pageant 's like a roach motel .

let go ! let go of me . oh my god , it 's cops !

hey ! turn that float around . you think a swan 's gon na swim ass first up main street ?

this is -- what ?

what !

so , remember the three most important parts of a good interview ...

gladys -- gladys ! look out !

y'betcha , iris . we still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme .

you get nothing , hank , okay ?

harold !

english ! english , you stupid little retard ! we america now , tina !

the king can do no wrong !

and everything . he should be king !

send for my car ...

i 'll have to enclose the check first .

`` my '' ...

oh , sure . we have horse maneuvers every morning .

i 've got ta five thousand men but no horses .

i think we oughtta have a standing army , so we can save money on chairs .

you told it to me .

i 've got just the job for you -- secretary of war .

half watch dog ?

well - what is he now ?

chicolini , you 've come just in time . we need a man who 's fearless , brave . a man who 's willing to die , if necessary .

fine - keep on yelling - do everything you can to disturb firefly - now what about your cousin ?

are you getting tired ?

oh -- you mean ... worm ?

you satisfied your selfish whims , while nations tottered , dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion -- not bad , eh ?

your excellency , something terrible has just happened .

why -- why -- of course .

well -- they might come better but they do n't come any bigger ... and the bigger the better . the bigger the betta you 've got on a horse , the more you lose , and speaking about horses , why do n't you marry me . come , come -- say yes and you 'll never see me again . i 'll go 'way if it means your happiness ...

guard them with your life ... do n't leave them out of your sight ... if the enemy gets those papers we 're lost . if they do n't get them , we 're lost . ca n't you see what i 'm trying to tell you ? i love you ... mrs. teasdale , you 're the salt of the earth . they do n't come any better than you ...

let him patch up his own breeches ...

why , that 's the speech that lincoln made at gettysburg ...

it is every woman 's problem . who supplies the sons ? -- the brothers ? -- the husbands ? who ...

with mrs. teasdale as my wife and freedonia under my control --

but why did i do it ? what was this all for ? so john merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort ? or so i could become famous ?

and here are my mother and father .

well , these things take time .

frederick , why are you so interested in this particular case ?

he is . i mean , i 've always thought he was . i think he must be . is he simple ? or is that just something i 've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself ?

but i thought you said that he was rather ... simple ?

like this .

i found it .

excuse me , mr. treves , sir .

shut up !

do n't !

you think you 're better ' n me ? you wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself , you guv . so i gave him to you . on trust , in the name of science ! and now i want him back .

i like doing business with you . you and i understand each other , completely . i know i can trust you . ca n't i ?

this man belongs in hospital .

he must have taken quite a fall .

please do .

of course they will . they 're reasonable men .

... yes , sir .

shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon ?

good morning , sir .

good morning , treves .

i am very pleased to meet you .

it was a great pleasure to meet you , mr. merrick .

yes , of course ... well , it 's been a pleasure meeting you , mr. merrick . good day .

certainly , if you insist . you must have quite a find there .

your majesty shall mock at me ; i can not speak your england .

oh no ... no ... you 're a romeo .

alas , no .

mr. treves says that you are in the theatre . do you live there ?

good day ... !

well it is a miracle he ever got back . and , i 'm sure , mr. treves , under your expert care , he 'll have many happy years ahead .

oh no , my friend ...

you 're english .

the main spire .

thank you ... very much .

no , nothing .

mr. treves , tell me ... tell me truly . is it alright , did i make any mistakes that you can see ?

are you sure ? because i can take it back .

yes , john .

i thought as much .

yes , john ?

john , there 's someone here who would like to meet you . would that be alright ?

here .

i 'm not used to such kindness . from a beautiful woman .

i promise you . you will never see the inside of that horrible place again . you will never , ever go back to the workhouse ... or that man . it 's a splendid room , do n't you think ?

the hospital ?

hello , my name is john merrick .

say `` mmmerrick . ''

yyyy ... yyye ... yyyess .

well ...

parrots can do as much , mr. treves . it 's all very nice , but i do n't see the point . you know they wo n't let him stay here .

wo n't come out , eh ?

you bastard ! you tortured him . you tortured him , you bastard . where is he ?

when i left him , he was in his bed , safe and sound .

just one of the curious . i 'd like to see it .

i do n't know how you do it , aud ... i sometimes think you 've got some of your mother 's magic ...

it 's all in your own mind , father ... it 's you who imagine that i 'm always up here with some man or other ... .

ah ! so you admit there is someone !

who , father ?

open up ! i know you 're in there !

then i shall come too .

no living man has ever set foot in the halls of asgaard ... the gods will never let you return .

of course .

and thanks for the cloak invisible !

goodbye , aud ...

that 's just what i was trying to tell you . you are ...

why do you go on about that ? what does it matter ?

what are what ?

we blew the horn resounding .

halfdan wanted to stop you waking the gods ... so ... i disguised myself to sabotage their plans .

is there nothing men can do ?

the sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is .

i know that the great blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years , and will keep it for the next thousand .

why ?

it 's all part of our safety regulations . you see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then ... well ...

is that odin ?

why ?

oh , that 's all right then ... it 's the thought ... that counts ...

louder .

you do n't like it , do you ?

have you done this sort of thing before ?

do n't you feel it ?

he wants to kill us .

halfdan the black 's here !

let 's hack her to pieces .

very deep ... usually ...

what are you talking about ?

`` but '' what ?

make your mind up .

row ! row ! row !

look out !

what `` magic '' have you brought , erik ?

shut up !

no ! arrgh !

oh ... i feel a little ... oh ...

that 's true . you 'd better sit there . you there , and ornulf there .

no ! we 'd be the first living men to set foot in the halls of the gods .

no , do n't say anything else !

i think we should go ...

nobody gets killed .

who gets killed ?

what is it ?

but how could he know ... unless ...

i came to find my grandfather .

let me do something for myself for a change !

i do n't want to have to sit next to snorri all that time .

look , i bagged it last week .

no , it is not .

oh , yes ! i had n't noticed that !

what are you talking about ?

what are you doing , keitel blacksmith ?

it 's me . i 'm just going to water the dragon ...

help !

that 's right .

my brother blacksmiths !

but , keitel , if erik ever finds the horn resounding ... if he ever crosses bi-frost , the rainbow bridge ... if he ever wakens the gods..

ca n't make enough axe-heads !

well , of course he is !

hold it ! hold it in !

i know , dad .

shut up .

well ... i 'm game .

and if you have to kill somebody , kill them ! do n't stop to think about it .

yes , mother . goodbye , dad .

yeah , you told me that later .

say hi to naomi .

thanks , guys .

they ca n't erase memories . it 's a joke . it 's a nasty clementine hoax .

yay ! it 'll be great ! i 'll get my shit .

i sort of do . but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality . cleaned up enough to be erotic .

a bully ? moi ?

i do n't know . what if it breaks ?

so you 'll call me , right ?

i think we should go .

i wish we did . you married ?

yeah , yeah . it goes `` perhaps there is someone in this world to whom i could send all these lines '' ?

do you know her poem that starts `` seaside gusts of wind , /and a house in which we do n't live ...

seems too coincidental that way .

i know .

yeah , like that .

i 'm joel .

even then i did n't believe you entirely . i thought how could you be talking to me if you could n't talk to people ?

joel , i 'm not a concept . i want you to just keep that in your head . too many guys think i 'm a concept or i complete them or i 'm going to make them alive , but i 'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind . do n't assign me yours .

they found us before . the plan did n't work . i do n't know what to do now .

i want my mommy . i do n't want to lose you , clem .

well ... if they 're looking for me in memories i 'm in , what if you take me to a memory i 'm not in ? and we can hide there till morning .

do you know the velveteen rabbit ?

yeah , tangerine ?

i do n't want to talk about this here .

oh shit . i remember this . want to go ?

i 'm fucking crawling out of my skin .

i ca n't believe you wrecked my car . you 're driving drunk . it 's pathetic .

tonight . just to test out the phone lines and all .

you 'll call me , right ?

you should stay .

no .

sorry . my life is n't that interesting . i go to work . i go home . i do n't know what to say .

exactly . exactly ! that 's exactly my feeling about it . it 's hard to know . like , okay , but how many times do i think something and it does n't happen ? that 's what you 're saying , right ? you forget about those times . right ?

yeah , i do n't know . it 's hard to know .

me neither . but sometimes i have premonitions , so , i do n't know . maybe that 's just coincidence . right ? y'know , you think something and then it happens , or you think a word and then someone says it ? y'know ?

thanks .

you like that ?

never mind . sorry , that was stupid . i 'm embarrassed . good night , joel .

wilmont . near the high school .

yeah ?

no , that 's okay . thanks , though .

huckleberry hound ?

oh , i doubt that 's the case .

i 'm sure you would .

yeah . tom waits says it in --

i like it .

jesus , is it five years ? i got ta quit right now .

ucch , really ? you 're kidding . god . bizarre small world , huh ? yeah , that 's me : book slave there for , like , five years now .

really ?

your dried cum .

i mean , i have n't even told anyone i 've met you . who would even know to do this ?

i just walked in .

what took you so long ?

there you are . naomi , it 's just ... i 'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had ...

i ca n't . i have to go home . i 'll do it later .

clementine . i should just maybe talk to her .

the pill was pink , i remember . it had some letters and numbers on it . what were they ? al 1718 ? al something . four digits . i do n't like taking pills when i do n't know what they are . i have no choice .

you have to stop this !

is there any sort of risk of brain damage ?

in a minute .

how did i look ?

shit !

well , what should we do ?

i do n't know what to do ! i do n't know what to do ! crap . crap ...

do n't you think howard 's like that ? smart ? important ?

well , allow me to do the honors . it 's fucking freezing and i need something .

'kay .

boo .

you made me have an abortion .

yes , shit . oops , sorry ! sorry . it 's just i told myself i was n't going to say pope alexander and sound like a dope and then i go ahead and do it . like i psyched myself out .

there 's another one i like , i read . it 's by pope alexander .

do you like quotes , howard ?

welcome , howard .

cole slaw , ice tea ?

thanks , mary . you can bring her in .

jesus .

i do n't know what you 're talking about , howard .

so , i 've got to drop the van off .

mary . what are you doing here ?

i think he 's in a conference . unfortunately . i 'm really sorry .

she 's right in the neighborhood . she 's upset .

it 's a quote book .

what do you believe in then ?

clockworks .

so be it . it looks serious this time , though . all these guns ... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes ?

what is debbie 's position ?

whose fault was that ?

she 's obviously that . jesus ! which would you rather have , a million dollars or one of sissy 's thumbs full of pennies ?

my thumbs hurt . i 've made a mistake . i 've been negligent . i have n't exercised . i have to hitchhike a little bit every day , no matter what . it 's like a musician practicing his scales . when i do n't practice , my timing gets off , my thumbs get stiff and sore .

i 'm cold .

i 'm the best .

yep .

well , okay . i 'll try it . i do n't see the point in it , but i 'll try it . just for you . it 's kind of silly , actually , me going out with an artist in new york city . however ...

a born freak can only go uphill .

... do you copy ?

i 'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it . now step aside , old man .

i heard it .

that means top-secret , cooper .

ballast .

the containment , second containment ...

we 'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the apu .

shit , smith , you 're going biblical on me .

skipper , do we get hazard pay for this ?

please ... kill ...

do you hear it ? right there .

of course not . justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it . just one of those things . i swore i 'd never lose another man . i came close today . real close .

90 over 50 and falling ... .

a power drain --

i would n't bring you here on a hoax . houston confirms the telemetry and i.d . codes .

i apologize for the short notice , bill , but we 've had something come up that requires your immediate attention . lyle ?

you do n't just dismiss bill weir . the man held oppenheimer 's chair at princeton . if the event horizon had worked , he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since einstein .

navigation control tried to hail the vessel . this was the only response .

how do you know all this ?

i designed the ship 's propulsion system . i am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive . you ca n't send a search and rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed . that would be like ... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle .

i 'll get back to the log . but on the bridge , i wo n't go back , back in there ...

... you okay ?

i am sorry . but now we have to go to work .

if you miss me , you 'll blow out the hull . you 'll die too .

what about my ship ?

the `` other place , '' what is that ... ?

`` insane ? '' the finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship . it would take the lewis and clark a thousand years to reach our closest star . the event horizon could be there in a day ...

it 's insane .

it 's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core , distorting space-time . they could be what hit the lewis and clark .

negative .

be careful . it 's not a load bearing structure ...

what is it , smith ?

we have a situation here ...

put it through tacs . smith , you up for a flyby ?

we 've got some weather .

i guess we 're about to find out . keep us slow and steady .

what 's going on in there , starck ?

no . it was someone else .

maybe one of the original crew ?

do it . dr. weir ...

the event horizon sensors show the same thing : `` bio-readings of indeterminate origin . '' right before that wave hit the clark , there was some kind of surge , right off the scale , but now it 's back to its previous levels .

what about the life readings you picked up ?

keep your eyes open .

come around to three-three-four ...

what ?

that 's the core : the gravity drive . the heart of the ship .

jesus , that is one big ugly fat fucker ...

where is she ?

why dr. weir , i think you 're in love .

i ca n't believe we built this .

what is it ?

if they were in stasis , i 'd get a location , but these readings , they 're all over the ship . it does n't make any sense .

the reactor 's still hot . we 've got several small radiation sources , leaks probably . nothing serious .

how ?

i like the sound of that .

i 'm blind , not deaf . wan na come in ?

i do n't think she 's real big on hate .

i would n't be caught dead in that .

i can only stay for one drink , ben . i 've got to meet with victor .

i 'll schedule the launch . call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew .

he could n't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass . yet another mistake for `` mr . fantastic . ''

come on . let me buy you something to eat . looks like you could use the company .

about me ? how sweet .

deb ... it 's me . i need you to step out front .

just get back soon , or i start looking for a new groom .

glad `` nothing '' could take you away from your work .

am i okay ? ! you wan na explain that ? !

he 's smart , powerful , successful --

yeah , you and debbie and perfect --

you go through something like this , makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life .

external srbs , orbital system engines . its just like the shuttles you flew in --

he knew about nasa . what if he made the call to shut us down --

i ca n't take this .

stay right . left is trouble .

meet me at 4:01 , top of the run . that 'll give you a minute to freshen up .

what are you trying to say ? just because i dress well and like to dance --

ben grimm is a genuine american hero who 's been through a terrible orde --

now what is up with that ?

victor 's right . johnny , get to the command center . close the shields .

girl ... ? !

wait . you mean there 's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic ?

i think that thing is ben .

flame on , flame off . flame on , flame off --

please tell me you go silent too .

that 's why . because i could have any other woman ... you know , when they asked caesar `` why england , '' he said , `` because it 's not mine . ''

get me on the am shows , larry king , cover of the journal ... i 've got to do something about this scar . make sure they only shoot my right side .

and if he 's not ... ?

i did . i did , reed ... but i wanted you to be that man .

what about you ? you have n't eaten in days . how come you 're never on this side of the microscope ?

it has to be the cloud . it 's fundamentally altered our dna .

which is precisely the point . analysis is over . it 's time for action . my men could have mass-produced this by now .

hilarious .

just find him .

since when do you shop at the flea market anyway ?

hey , brad . are you still a virgin ?

thanks for getting rid of those flowers .

they 're not home yet .

your friends use the pool . your friends messed it up .

yes , sir .

he insulted me first . he called me a moron .

all right . all right . i just cleaned b-8 . give me a break .

mike ! you have a mess on c-9 !

it 's already planned , mike . it 's going to cost $ 150 at the free clinic .

i guess i did .

i 'm sorry . i 'm really sorry .

i want you to know that it 's your final decision if we should continue or not .

you 're a really good kisser .

pick a suit .

ace the jacket .

yeah ?

did you get her number ?

how 've you been ?

romance in ridgemont ? we do n't even get cable tv .

that little prick .

i 'm not going to tell him . he 's an asshole . i hate him .

what do you think ?

how long does doug take ?

listen to this ... it says 'most women derive pleasure from sex , but they do n't have real orgasms . '

stacy . what does it matter ? he 's a stereo salesman . you want to marry him ? you want to have kids with him ? you want this guy to come home , fifty years old , and he 's still got that little pacific stereo badge on ? come on .

you 've got to get used to working christmas . people are always screaming and yelling ... then they get home and they 're all christmasy .

hey ! that 's my line !

it was nice .

yeah but they look more sophisticated . you 'd probably think they 'd be better in bed .

no way ! he just called him a dick .

hey , mr. hand , can i ask you a question ?

i think i 've made my point with you tonight .

do you want to sit there , jeff ?

that 's right , jeff . mind if i come in ?

am i hallucinating here ? just what in the hell do you think you 're doing ?

thank you , desmond . what 's the reason for your truancy ?

mr. spicoli ?

it 's very warm out tonight .

i 'm fine . mark , i 'm so glad you came over here because i want you to know something . i just thought i would tell you that i really enjoyed getting to know you this year .

hi , stacy . how are you ?

john bonham . the drummer for led zeppelin . he died a couple years ago . every birthday he stays home and plays everything john bonham ever recorded . it 's like his own holiday .

i 've heard that , too .

yeah . she is pretty good .

sure thing .

we keep them , in case the people come back .

of course . and now i have to get back to the news . send up some ice .

tell me . what do you want ?

killed ?

let 's have lunch !

he is . do n't worry , i 'll get it to him .

what ?

a major !

wait a minute ! come back and have a beer !

what ?

inspector rock will pay you . in cash . a thousand dollars on the ninth of every month .

i think we should put her on the payroll . see what she comes up with .

... grow claws ... bleeding warts .

man , your head would swell up like a watermelon , you 'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours ...

some of what ?

it 's gone too far .

good work . they 'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that .

she 's perfect for this gig . these cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her . we can set her up in one of these back street motels , hang pictures of jesus all over the room , then turn these pigs loose on her ... hell she 's strong ; she 'll hold her own .

you bastard ! i need a lawyer immediately !

not me . it would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they 'd make me explain it !

that dirty bastard ! i knew it ! he 's got hold of my woman !

good god ! let 's get out of here ! where 's the elevator ?

some angry rotarian shoves you and you think : what 's happening here ? what 's going on ? then you hear yourself mumbling .

they 'll probably have a big net for us when we show up .

shoot it .

thirty minutes . it was going to be very close .

alice . just ring linen service and ask for alice .

a nap wo n't help . i 've been awake for too long -- three or four nights . i ca n't even remember . if i go to sleep now , i 'm dead for twenty hours .

yeah . i know . i 'm guilty . i understand that . i knew it was a crime but i did it anyway . shit , why argue ? i 'm a fucking criminal .

you 're killing him !

i do n't know , i just got here . did you find your girl ?

where is everyone ?

we 'll meet in three hours ?

nah , i got the gun .

where 's that ?

that 's the oldest of the bunch , looked like the grandpapa . we caught the little one , junior , in the cooler there . as we 've seen , what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed .

well , why do n't you keep your observations to yourself ?

look .

no . you ?

fuck you too .

come on !

we 're better off .

you were n't helpin ' .

why do n't you go check it out ?

your parents of relation ?

what ? really ?

okay then .

but --

what 's going on between you two ?

what ?

in the kitchen , under the sink .

huh ?

they were all over the place .

move slow and move quiet .

done . but you 're locked in . will you hold the keys ?

you are taking a chance that is not worth the risk .

duh hickey .

you do n't want the rag to touch the booze , that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it .

everyone take a role . let 's prepare the guns , ammo and whatever else we can scare up . we also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here . so , who 's going into the basement with me ?

get to your cars !

i think --

i 'd love to .

deal .

she 's still alive , i hope . i would n't have made it this far if it were n't for the chance of seeing my little girl again . i need to get to her .

all right .

oh sweetheart ! what was i thinking ? mommy is never gon na let you go . oh jesus ... never , ever , never let you go .

come on , she 's an important columnist ! what 's the matter ? i thought you wanted these people to forgive you .

this is a mistake . no . this is a disaster .

oh . i mean , good .

i do n't know who she fucked to get where she is , but i do n't think it was me .

very fine bone structure .

good morning , mr. bebe !

look , mr. bebe , you can hold me to my contract , but you ca n't break me . i 'm back , and i 'm gon na make the best of it .

i 'm not !

does clifford even know ? you did n't tell him , did you ? i 'm gon na tell him . where is he ?

get out !

sort of .

you learn your lines ?

oh , god ! let 's get her out of here tonight , right now ! let 's take her with us !

one question . if i 'm not myself now , just who do you think i am ?

... do n't you ?

yes , yes , it 's all arranged . everyone 's collecting subscriptions in your name . and the best part is : the trip returns you to new york .

you know where you 're taking me . you know what she 'll do . just give me a minute , slow down , give me an instant for once in your life , please ?

they 'll just catch you again , francie . besides , your mother will know .

dad ... whatever i decide , will it be okay with you ?

what you have to understand , francie , is that she ... well ... she wanted so much for herself too , and for me , and she never really got to ... the only time i ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers ... but she could have been ... if times were different she could have been a politician or ... i do n't know .

an essay contest ... a national contest . that 's pretty impressive .

it always amazes me , lil , how you can whip up a hot , hearty meal out of thin air .

oh angela , my own ... angela !

i do n't believe this ! you jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you do n't even know who the hell i am !

gosh ! you 'll break a lot of hearts .

i 'm not sure .

yeah . yeah , i heard about that .

well ... you 're looking well .

oh please , harry ... do n't even think it . you 're the only person who ever ... it 's just ... ca n't you wait for me ?

frances , it 's me , harry ?

who ?

i know . do n't tell anyone .

will you marry me ?

to quarter-horses .

hey ! another shot for the lady and a double for me !

yeah ? she 's a shark , frances . i 'm not taking you there , and that 's that !

no , she just did n't want me going to jail , that 's all .

you 've looked a whole lot better . c'mon .

you 're coming .

yeah , and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are , what 's going on inside their heads . sometimes you can hear it , like a buzzing , the things that happen in their heads . and you wonder : does anybody ever love anybody , really ?

nice joint . can you afford it ?

harry , i hate being in love . i do n't ever want to be in love again . i just hate it !

do n't start , farmer .

if they say they love it , they 'll probably love it . not everybody lies , you know ?

you 're telling me .

i always told ya , frances . you got real ability .

well ... do n't you think it 's up to me to ...

you looked okay . joint 's pretty dead . how 'bout i take you home ?

but i 'm not . the newspapers 're --

wherever they 're going , i 'm going .

who 's writing this guy 's lines ?

who 're you ?

but what --

and now you 're throwing everything away ? you 're gon na be a nobody ! nobody ! you know what that 's like ? !

have n't you heard what i said ?

wait , mama , wait . i have something to tell you . i 've decided ... well ... i 'm not going to make movies anymore . i thought that 's what i wanted , and i went after it with all my soul , the way you taught me , but i was miserable , mama , and it nearly killed me . so now ... now it 's over . i want a different kind of life , something ... simple . i want to live someplace quiet and peaceful ... in the country maybe , and i 'll have dogs and cats -- i feel so light suddenly , so clear for the first time in ... it 's going to be okay , mama , i know it . and i love you .

for a walk , mama . just a walk .

are you crazy ? unhand that woman ! that 's amelia earhart !

tell them who i am ! tell them who i am !

it 's alright now , little sister , everything 's going to be just fine .

oh ma , they 're not using me . it 's just a chance to travel , see things . besides , it 's the only way i can get to new york .

and you accused her of tampering with your mail .

i 'll have someone show you to your room .

aw , shucks , ma'am . t'were n't nothin ' .

am i supposed to say 'thank you ' ?

no . i draw the line .

what does it matter ? she 'll live again . you 'll make her .

what is this ?

yes . i want this over and done with .

and if i consent ?

like you ? oh , god , you do n't know what you 're asking .

stolen memories . stolen and hazy . they taunt me in my dreams . i 've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her . whose woman was this ? i 've seen boys playing , splashing about in a stream . whose childhood friends were these ? who am i ?

in which part of me did this knowledge reside ? in these hands ? in this mind ? in this heart ? and reading and speaking . not things learned ... so much as things remembered .

you 're wrong . do you know i knew how to play this ?

how dare you . you 're disgusting and evil .

your crime ... as well as mine .

more to the point , why am i here ? what did you want with me ? what does one say to one 's maker , having finally met him face to face ? milton gave it voice . did i request thee , maker , from my clay to mould me man ? did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me ?

kill you ? hardly that .

so have i

is he not back yet ?

what does it say ?

victor !

it 's not something i can explain now . perhaps someday .

if what you say is true , it is a matter for the police !

this feels ... incestuous .

and you ?

she was mother to me as well . but ours is the job of the living . it 's up to us now to hold this family together . we must think of father and be strong for him . i can not do that alone .

how could all my father 's knowledge and skill fail to save her ?

he died . raving about phantoms . he was mad , poor devil . gather a detail . have the body removed from my cabin .

let it go .

no . they do n't .

how much longer ?

i 've been preoccupied .

that 's blasphemy !

it was wrong , henry ! it should n't have happened ! the bastard deserves to die .

only you would think of that !

these are exciting times , henry . we 're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs . look at edward jenner . he was n't content to bleed people with leeches , he pioneered a new frontier of thought

i know . you have a way of making an impression .

henry clerval .

of course i am . it pays to humor the insane .

i am not mad .

and is it true , miss moritz , that you love victor frankenstein ? that your heart was broken ? answer the question . do you love victor frankenstein ?

despite the lack of challenge .

or albertus magnus . cornelius agrippa ...

paracelsus ?

but surely , professor , you do n't intend we disregard the more ... philosophical works .

the strain was evident .

`` ... a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty .

to say the least . i came here to expand my mind , but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn . all we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new .

you have a way of provoking his . i 've been watching you . you seem impatient with your studies .

who are you ?

creature ? a ... human like creature ?

you 're awake . i 've prepared some broth . it 'll help restore you .

sure .

just a feeling . nothing personal .

bad bulb or no power . it 's getting a little gloomy in here .

i walked into it knowing i 'd get hurt , but i thought i could stand anything . i just was n't ready for that kind of pain . we were supposed to meet in l.a. when i got back there , he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife .

and it 's this place . it makes no sense , but it spooks me .

sure .

do n't burn that gorgeous body , or i 'll scratch your eyes out ...

come on , claudette . a man 's not made of stone .

is it stuck ?

i figured if i did n't save you . i 'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite .

give me a hand ?

god , but i love that sexy talk .

got ta pee . you 're lying on my bladder .

you ? the brick ?

i 'm a little scared of storms . always have been . since i was a kid .

ned !

but it 's in the brochure ! `` camp crystal lake has a full drama program . '' you just saw it .

it 's beautiful ...

how much do i owe you ?

i got to .

yeah .

i told you not to buy that hunk of junk !

it 's not suicide if you 're already dead . two ...

the truth hurts .

kate , scott ?

in the winnebago .

good for you . now , since we all believe we 're dealing with vampires , what do we know about vampires ? crosses hurt vampires . do you have a cross ?

are you so much a fucking loser , you ca n't tell when you 've won ?

why not , against your religion ?

i do n't have the slightest idea .

if he touches her , i 'll kill him . i do n't give a fuck how many guns you have , nothing will stop me from killing him .

no , i did n't .

did n't like it , did ya ?

yes .

you 're a preacher ?

oh , well , excuse me all to hell .

kate , we do n't have all day , so i 'm only gon na count to five . one ... two ... three ... four ...

later .

me too .

i 'm sorry .

well , when you run out of weapons , just start cold cocking 'em . make 'em sing for their supper .

yeah , we got a bible .

yes , it does , kelly . we have already alerted the mexican authorities . they intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice .

they 'll probably make a run for the border , which would bring 'em this way . and if we get our hands on those shit asses , we 're talking payback time . we 'll get 'em all right . i got ta piss . i 'm gon na use your commode .

have n't felt it a bit . been inside with the air conditioner blastin ' all day long .

you callin ' him a liar ?

what ? are you kidding ? i did n't do anything !

what dya mean ?

whiskey !

scarred for life , that 's how i am !

where are you ?

yeah , i guess . i 'm just a little fucked up .

yeah , when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard . it scared the shit outta me . sure you 're okay ?

i did ?

i do n't know , you just passed out .

oh , i know , was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and i broke it out ? yeah , you 're right , that was pretty fuckin ' nutty . not to mention stupid . but you know what ? i can fix that right now .

fuck those spic pigs ! you called me a fuckin ' nut , and where i come from , that stops the train on its tracks .

you just called me a fuckin ' nut .

they 're gon na search the van .

what ?

this is not me ! i am a professional fucking thief . i steal money . you try to stop me , god help you . but i do n't kill people i do n't have to , and i do n't rape women . what you doin ' ai n't how it 's done . do you understand ?

it 's not your fault , it 's her fault !

there 's nothing wrong with me , brother . that woman tried to escape and i did what i had to do .

she 's in the other room .

yeah , i saw the border . through binoculars from on top of a high building . that 's about as close as i risked getting . what 's the tv say ?

they do n't have anything except four walls and a roof , and that 's all we need .

i 'm not dead , but i 'm definitely shot ! i told you that bastard said , `` help us ! ''

okay , i 'll have one .

what 'd you find , kathy ?

who signed as his `` sponsoring officer '' ?

`` wickwire , thomas dane . '' see what you can find .

more than you 'd guess . it 's just that we do n't hold coffee klatches . if more then three of us get together at any one time , the guys think it 's some kind of uprising .

i 'm saying , we 're just friends .

permission to evaporate , o'neil .

`` we 'll all have lunch . '' good idea . oh , and let 's be sure to invite this sociologist , too -- just in case we want to have a fucking bridge game afterwards !

so i 'll get a fair shot ?

it 's you , sir . and it started the day i came here .

barber was my next stop , sir . would 've had it regulation sooner , only --

i 'm fine , sir .

aw , what is this ...

the navy 's conclusion regarding the crash of an f-14 aboard an aircraft carrier . female aviator , it just so happens . you 're familiar with this report and its conclusion , am i right ?

hardly the case , senator .

in face , i do : roper , harris , gallop -- they all come back the same .

should probably ask him that .

gon na be visiting that all-woman 's america 's cup team in a few weeks -- if i were a gambler , i 'd say dennis o'conner 's days are numbered . but they 're in san diego , so i thought i 'd take a quick promenade of the base .

california .

close as i can get , el-tee !

just do it , okay ?

she 's an officer . there 's a higher standard .

i 've had it . just because they pay me like a baby-sitter does n't mean i 'm gon na be one .

time .

thank you , sir . but i like these just fine .

sure . i 'll join the crowd .

me ? why me ?

well , guess i do n't even need to be here ...

i take it you do n't either . feet .

you expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back ? is that correct , o'neil ?

i think you look beautiful .

hey . way to gut it out .

was n't deemed a threat .

right down to your worthless womb , and i 'll tell you why . this is my island . my world . and here i can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world . take another scan of my little joy- boy outside . if i can do that to a navy seal , what 's gon na happen to you ? huh ?

green eggs and ham . you 're not going to get anywhere . you might as well put me in the cage .

maybe we should call the coast guard .

north ?

well , who the shit you think you are ? comin ' in here like that ?

if you were the president , would n't that put a little piss in your shoes ?

the e-ringers ? full integration is gon na cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when congress is already swinging the axe .

shut up . how can you eat like that ?

who was that french guy , anyway .

i was wrong .

i did n't mean for it to turn out like this . look , i lied to you . i 'm not a reporter . when we broke up and i came out to new york i was so sure i 'd make it . but i have n't . that 's why i needed this story so bad . i just could n't tell you i 'm a failure .

i should n't have to , audrey . you 're supposed to be my friend . i trusted you .

yeah , well he just turned up in new jersey at the military command post . somehow all this is related to what happened down in panama . there 's a story here . i know it . you got any tape or glue ?

that 's the problem . he did .

can i use some ?

this is not the place ...

three years digging up worms in chernobyl ? how did mrs. tatopoulos handle it ?

chargeures , property and casualty insurance . we are preparing a report .

we 're hoping you 're going to help us figure that out .

they 're enormous ! a new species created by man 's recklessness . that 's what i 've been trying to tell you , i 'm only a biologist . i take radioactive samples and study them .

it means that due to a man made accident the chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before . mutated by seventeen percent ?

dr. niko topopolosis ?

it 's raymond .

hello ?

555-7600. tell them it 's a code dragonfly . they should get you through .

so you 're in ?

this is america . there is nothing you can not buy .

oh , my bags . i 've checked them in .

do n't speak , quellek .

i ... i do n't think i 'm going to make it sir ...

not so bad . we 'll get you to medical quarters . you 're going to be fine .

kill it ? well i 'm open to ideas ! ...

i 'm glad you asked ... to me the most important qualities of a galaxy explorer are loyalty ...

the engines are dead . we 're drifting .

yes you did .

no i did n't .

he knocked me out the sonofabitch . where is he ?

shit ! i 'm doing it ! i 'm repeating the damn computer !

oh alex , get away from that thing ...

you 've got the utility systems walkthrough , right ?

okay , you can go on in ... i 'm going to get kyle . he knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive .

i knew it ! ... i knew it ! ...

it 's fractured ...

ok !

no , i 'll kill you . .

right .

the digital conveyer ? you mean i 'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces ?

i am so sick of being right .

because i died in episode 31 !

it 's a rough plan , guy ! what does it matter if we 're doing episode 31 or not ? !

it does n't have to be a hologram ... just a diversion .

let 's just pick up the pace a little , shall we ?

i think he just likes pointing at things .

you have no idea what a perimeter is , do you ?

where 'd they go ? back inside ?

they 're gone .

tommy , 270 degree turn to port !

wait ... jason , here ! ...

so ... we get to shut down the neutron reactor ?

turn on the translation circuit .

thank god . are you okay ?

jason..

ninty-nine percent of acting is commitment . acting . stella adler never manned a resonance cannon , she taught acting ...

well you have to tell them . what if something happens ? we 're actors , not astronauts ... we ca n't do this stuff !

one minute i 'm - hey , i 'm dressing . '

you know it 's one thing to treat us this way , but how can you do this to your fans ? ...

what do you want me to say , gwen ? ... they wanted the commander .

how much of a nothing ? not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing ?

you 're kidding . when for ?

yes ... you understand that , do n't you , mathesar ? ...

our dimwitted friends do n't understand the concept of acting . they have no theater , no imagination these scientists .

i do n't know .

then tell me one thing ... what does it do , the device ? the omega 13 .

listen , i 'd like to , but frankly.. i 'm not even sure where it is , or even ...

right . well ... listen , i 'm i 'm sorry about that whole ... thing.. before . it was kind of a misunderstanding . i 'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people ... how 's the uh ... ... that going to heal up ? god , i hope so , i feel just awful about that .

you can oc that ?

but ... inside , i have seen-

he has a very powerful ship . perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-

home .

catch me later , okay ?

right , if this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent , but make sure i have a limo from my house , they jammed me into a toyota the last time i did one of these

hold course , laredo !

excuse me ?

i did n't say that . i said `` would n't it be great if we could always , work together . '' that 's what i said .

you go too far , benedict .

they love reed and his inquisition ! i think they hope to share in his disgusting profits ! it 's becoming the american way !

as soon as the men have good shelters i 'll move . perhaps martha will join me this winter .

gates ? he used my battle plan and i humbly submit that without me he 'd still be back at saratoga waiting for the british to attack . george , why have n't you moved into the potts ' house back at the creek ? much more befitting of a commander and chief than your field tent . and ... you could entertain . i think you need to entertain more . seriously ! get a few new jersey whores up here , invite some congressmen ... could n't hurt .

is that a fact .

go on ... i want to hear everything .

but trust you to do what ? one side in congress wants compromise ; another glorious battle ; some surrender -- some , of course , just want power and money . but if you do n't mind my asking , george , what are your plans ?

oh , they have reasons ... there 's a lot of confusion these days .

congress has picked up it 's skirts and is racing for baltimore . they 're not waiting for spring ! of course , they still had time to deny my promotion . even john adams voted against it ...

well , you fought with them against the french and iroquois , how good were they then ?

patience , colonel arnold . active personalities terrify these men . but , congratulations on your victory at ticonderoga ...

a lot of years have gone by .

well ... i misunderstood , then .

tell mrs. washington i am compelled to stay a while longer .

by red , what rank would you say this black , officer , soldier is , colonel ?

yes , my lord .

but it 's more than just that , am i right ?

george , you 're the only man the people trust ... trust with power . they know you wo n't betray them .

they 're among the best divisions the british have . no conscripts , no impressed recruits , just professional killers .

and is that the most horrible thing in the world ?

general washington , is there actually going to be a compromise , i mean , a 'deal ' with england ?

how old are you , captain ?

george , we 've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army .

you wo n't be needing his largess , rhode island is already committed to your appointment .

with your support , horatio . as one of our own who has seen combat with the british , your opinion counts .

let 's not over do it ...

he 's from virginia -- there is no more classist , elitist ... english place on earth than virginia . and , what in hell has he done for our cause ? washington has been preaching compromise , compromise , compromise ! hancock acts , he led the boston tea party ! that 's why new england loves him .

congress is bitterly opposed to allowing negroes in the army !

are you all going insane ! ? benedict arnold ! the man who stopped the british on lake champlain ! who carried the day at saratoga ! goddamn-it , joseph , you own two mansions , ride in an expensive , tory coach ! you are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs !

how can you say that ?

i mean , i 'm a deist . a belief i share with the likes of tom jefferson and ben franklin . surely you knew that .

a grand scheme ?

well , george , congress just passed a resolution censuring arnold for destruction of government property . i would n't cast my fate with that man .

because , if the british got off their asses and came up here , now , we would be smashed . and the revolution would be finished . tell king louis , it 's that bad .

i do n't want to see your hospital .

leave me , now sir , i am tired .

some things must never change .

what 's the point of a revolution if it does n't ?

that 's right ...

everything . if we force britain into concessions it will open up the western lands -- and that would be a boon for our family . we already have more slaves than we need , but we need more land .

i can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated , to be destroyed ...

i 'm very aware of that .

surely you knew this was coming .

well , this must be about something !

yes sir , it 's a wise idea ...

nathanael , i 'm sending you to virginia to head the southern army , to harass cornwallis . marquis , you must go with him .

yes , i thought that 's how you 'd feel , nathanael .

well sir , i was an ironmaster before you got me . maybe i will let you down yet .

a horseshoer ?

i was born with a limp , sir . the militia used to hate it when i marches with them because my pike would always sway ...

yes , yes , happy to meet you .

they 're finished , they ca n't help us anymore ! they 've done their duty , general greene , now you do yours !

i remember a pair of young philosophers once , who laughed at the world .

but not more than your comfort .

you know very well who it is that i love .

well , the widow curtis will bring you riches , position , land , even half-grown children . you wo n't have to do anything at all ! you sha n't have to do another thing to prove yourself .

think what the play means , william . perhaps these words have a place in the real world .

those people ? i doubt they 'd think of this . ooo , you 're wonderful this color !

i always though london was the place to be : capital of the world , the most spectacular city on earth .

perhaps you best ask , why you wish it . you asked william to teach you manners , philosophy , decorum ... as i said , it 's completely stupid .

do n't be silly , you have whole worlds to fathom .

you keep hittin ' him like that , he ai n't gon na look like he broke in anymore , he gon na look like someone beat him up and then shot him .

we 'll get it later .

into air bags . there 's no cushion under what you 're doing . i 'm out of it , cat . i 'm done .

i seen it , but i do n't believe it . says harry shot ronnie five times . four to the chest and one through his foot .

you did n't have to shoot him , bo . we coulda just beat him up some .

shit , now someone 's got ta climb down there and get him .

you think i 'd be standing here ? you set somebody up and you want it to work , it has to be a surprise . can you remember that ?

i went to uc san diego . we 're gon na spend the weekend at the universal sheraton . we 're gon na take the tour . see the shark . check out the miami vice action spectacular . after , we 'll come here , get our money .

your who ?

what , you gon na shoot me now , bo ?

lem me see if i got this right , you break into karen flores ' house , ask me for three hundred grand , does n't even belong to you ?

i need the money .

i put a gun right here ... ... and i tell him , 'sign the paper marty or your fuckin ' dead . ' like that .

no shit , come on . how you gon na do that ?

i 'm just explaining to you what i 'm doing here . case you think i come to rob the place , rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has .

but first i want to know who i 'm talking to . am i talking to you , or am i talking to him ?

it 's not the kind of thing you do .

all i want in return is to work on the movie with you . fact i already got some ideas on how to fix it up .

it 's a different kind of deal .

i 'm already in town , but it do n't matter . we got dick in the bank . we dumped it all in harry 's movie .

i can hear you , but where the fuck are you , man ?

who is this ? i 'm the one telling you the way it is , okay , asshole ? that 's who i am . now you want your three hundred grand or do n't you ?

are you the guy they called ray bones ?

i 'm a producer .

do n't waste your time , harry . the guy 's not much of a movie fan . now c'mon , gim me the key .

you have it ?

yeah , he wants us to talk to buddy , set up a meeting .

how 's anyone gon na see anything from way up there ?

that 's the difference between you and me , harry . i say what i mean . i want something from someone , i ask 'em straight out . i want martin weir , i go get martin weir . i do n't fuck around with his trainer 's shrink .

you tell me you want these guys off your back . next thing i know , you 're saying yeah , maybe they can have a piece of mr. lovejoy . i could n't believe my fuckin ' ears .

because i need half a million to buy a script .

what i did till recently . after i get done here i 'll think about what i 'm gon na do next .

okay . i 'm listening .

guy owes me fifteen large and takes off , i go after him . the fuck you think i do ?

one of mine ?

no , i do n't . though i have to say i 'm curious .

you can keep what you won today . that 's yours .

from when ? you left vegas with four- fifty ?

i did n't know where else to keep it . where would you ?

we call you a taxi .

oh , shit ... i 'm sorry ... i thought that was ... i 'm so sorry ...

it 's not dave . it 's a movie .

continental , but it does n't matter . martin wo n't order from the menu .

definitely not martin . movie stars never pick up the check . they have no idea what things cost . most of them do n't know their zip code and a lot do n't even know their own phone number .

depends , who pays ?

you were supposed to wait for me with harry at the restaurant .

not yet .

i just caught the end .

how come you stopped making movies with harry ?

i know i 'm better than what i 've been doing the last ten years , walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps , waiting till it 's time to scream .

lem me get this straight , you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before ?

what 're you doing here ?

you gon na start that again ? you 're just like him , all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin ' thing .

in an armchair . or i go to a coffee shop , sleep there . sit in a booth , pull my hat down .

what i 'm thinkin ' is maybe momo could buy it .

hm ?

what 'emotion ' ? girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick .

yeah , what 'd he have to say ?

yeah , me too . he was a helluva good writer . and i would know . i discovered him . made him what he was .

harry zimm . you look like a wet kiss .

harry , what 're you still doing with those guys ?

he 's telling me an idea for a movie . it 's not bad so far . sit down , have a drink . tell karen , let 's see what she thinks .

harry , are you going down , or you want me to ?

yeah , well i turned off the set . i used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor . you know what could 've happened ? the dog came in and stepped on it , turned the tv back on .

hi , sweetface . you look great . and mmmmm , you smell good , too .

roger that , north island . arctic warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two . over and out .

when they find out what it 's carrying , they may not be so interested in what 's legal .

that 's what it says .

hell no . you think i 'm crazy ?

right . wednesday .

i 'm telling you , i saw somebody . i do n't know who it was . but i saw somebody .

ever heard of insurance , big boy ?

somebody 's probably looking for her as we speak .

you think that 's funny

tomorrow we 'll see if we ca n't find some line and tackle . use some of those bodies below decks for bait .

i do n't figure there 's much i want money ca n't buy .

what the fuck -- ?

take it easy , willya ? what about the radio ? !

i might be able to find something on the ship . but it 's gon na take time .

damn barbaric is what it is .

fresh ai n't the first word that comes to mind .

yeah , reconsider fucking his shit up .

we 'll stand a watch . four on , eight off . low man first .

not in the eyes of the law .

it looks like it .

so what 're we gon na do . that 's the big question , right ?

what , you think there 's something funny about it ?

three , four days .

how long , then ?

what about running number two by itself ?

but how long ?

it 's a bloody navigation hazard . one boat ca n't control a ship that size .

lights ?

headache , nausea , lights ?

he 'd let you off at the nearest port , that 's for sure .

morning everybody .

if the weather holds it might not be so bad .

over the gold .

epps ? you there ?

that much i think we 've already established .

victims of what ?

no . i think they are , were , just passengers . innocent victims .

could n't sleep .

what ?

only something must 've gone wrong .

so , we find this guy and make a deal with him .

of course i 'm sure . i saw him .

who ?

so what did happen ?

coffee ?

now hold up just a minute . let 's be reasonable here .

we 're still drifting .

drink up then .

we 'll have to take it easy then . i do n't think we 'll find much aboard the ship , but it 's probably worth looking around .

i say we off-load some of that gold now .

supposing he wants to get bad with us ?

whatever the reason , she 's adrift and abandoned . we 've got every right to salvage her .

sorry .

it 's funny .

too deep to anchor out there .

you got that right .

that cost me twenty grand at least .

i thought you say tuesday .

but i ca n't --

it 's nothing -- it 's just some hormonal thing ... do n't worry about it ...

have you seen my blue spatula ?

we 're almost done . hi . yeah ... no , it 's excluded . they 've already paid the earnest money ... well , let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through . right , great , sounds good !

dana ! hi ! uh , dana ... this is enid ...

really ? i never really cared for those . why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one ?

uh , no . i missed that one . but what do i know ? i like laurel and hardy movies .

uh , well , that 's okay - i do n't dance , heh , heh ...

here we are ... it 's mocha mint from lickety splits . oh , is n't that photograph just heart-rending ?

i 'm sorry , enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before i can nominate you . i had to give it to someone else ... but i 'm sure next year i can --

so what do you think ?

as far as i know it includes housing and meals and everything ... it is really quite an offer ...

i 'm not sure ... i mean ... i guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it 's so shocking ?

and how do you think this addresses the subject of racism ?

these are all valid comments , but i think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this .

and what was your reason for choosing him as your subject ?

well lose it ! and why are n't you pushing the large sizes ? did n't you get training about upsizing ?

what ? i 'm just kidding around with the customers ... it 's my shtick !

what the hell is wrong with you ? !

i 'm gon na let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way i can evaluate your performance while it 's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds .

how long have you been up ?

are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms ?

why ?

but this guy is like a one-of-kind , rare butterfly , and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat ...

it 's just an excuse for us to spend time with you .

who , doug ? he spends more time here than i do ...

i dunno ...

oh yeah , i can tell you really love it !

actually , i 'm just about to go out with some friends ...

hello ?

what thing ?

why do you care about this kind of stuff ?

i 'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we 're ever going to move . are n't these the greatest towels ?

look , we have to get these ...

no matter what happened it would be a big disaster ... let 's just try and keep everything the way it is .

yeah , but maybe one of us should at least try ...

yeah , i guess ... call me ...

well , are we still going shopping tomorrow ?

do you want to do something tonight ?

if it makes you feel any better , i do n't think you could 've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff .

what are you talking about ? what kind of loser gets fired after one day ? !

when are you finally going to get your diploma ?

yeah , maybe it 'll be okay . at least i 'll get to see every movie for free , i guess ... i had to lie and tell them i already graduated ...

or maybe ... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos ? maybe that 's why we spend so much time together .

i 'm working on it ... i 've got a few leads ... it 's just that right now i have , all these projects that take up all my time .

he 's a total asshole ... he does n't even need that wheelchair , he 's just totally lazy !

where ?

we still have to go in there sometime .

okay , okay , i promise ... jesus , you 're out of your mind .

not really ...

yeah , but ... you know what i mean .

i know ... would n't you be totally pissed off ?

he 's insane !

are you sure ?

shh , it 's his answering machine ... we hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint beep .

you know , the green cardigan guy .

what is this ?

wait ... i just want to see what 's on this tape .

we should call him and pretend to be the redhead .

i know ... and instead of `` dessert '' it says `` mindbenders . ''

just look at them !

why ?

it 's totally sickening . let 's see if they gave me the right diploma ...

if you really want to `` fuck up the system '' - you should go to business school -- that 's what i 'm gon na do : get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside !

i hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago ... there are no buses on this street .

fuck you , you stupid redneck hick !

you never paid me for that tape with the indian dance routine .

i-i never expected anything like this to happen ...

no ... forget it ...

... do you really want us to drive away somewhere ?

i used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place ... do you ever think about stuff like that ?

at least you 're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports ... they 're all such fags !

what are you talking about ? you 're disappointed every minute of your life .

you need a bigger place - this is like a little kid 's room .

what 's the matter ?

... what do you mean ?

oh , uh ... they were a present from dana .

so , what kind of stuff do you guys do together ? is she into old records and stuff ?

where have you been ? i 've been looking all over for you ... i 've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you ...

uh ... hello ?

seymour ! i promise you that was n't a joke -- you have to call her back !

never mind , it 's way too complicated ... did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you 're totally confused all the time ?

i know . it 's not like it makes all your problems go away .

i 'm starting to think that even if i did get a girlfriend it really would n't change anything .

it 's just my stupid back . i 'll be all right in a minute ...

we just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who is n't a total idiot , that 's all .

now i remember why i have n't gone anywhere in months . i 'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there . i might as well be from another planet .

just wait here .

please ? we have to !

i do n't think so ...

please , seymour ... becky and i have been dying to go in here but we ca n't get any boys to take us ... please ?

maybe i do n't want to meet someone who shares my interests . i hate my interests ! where can i go to meet the exact opposite of myself ?

i really did n't get a good look at her .

you think it 's healthy to obsessively collect things ? you ca n't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff ... i 'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers .

i ... i did n't think you would have any interest in this get together ... i mean if you had told me you were coming i would have warned you -- it 's not like a real party or anything .

yeah , sure , i guess ...

there 's some good stuff in here ... do you like old music ?

sure ! ... wait , maybe not 78s , but i can play regular records ...

i wish i could see him .

i agree .

it 's a tampon in a teacup ...

talk to us about it ...

what ? is she having some secret affair with josh ?

i do n't know ... where is she , then ?

are you sure she was n't there ? maybe she was just hiding from you .

uh , do you mind if i wait ? i really need to talk to her .

seymour ?

you think so ? fine . it 's best you get out . go . tell all your people to go , run home where they 'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done , they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here , they were the only ones to flee-

you were contracted to work-

you 're right . the devil has come . look at me . i am the devil .

awhile back he ordered some bibles- -i 've brought them . is he here ?

so work must be going well ?

i 've got a reason far beyond confidence : my wife is having our firstborn in five months and i promised i 'd be with her when the baby comes .

well , he got away , did n't he ? riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off .

a man-eater attacks and you 're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it ?

tell me about beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are , how lucky he is to have you ?

i tried to be late , john- it would have been easier if you 'd gone .

that is correct . nothing .

but it 's crazy- the lion should n't be that hungry this soon . samuel ?

in your honor , nigel . and you and singh will be in charge of building them- and you 'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you 'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks .

how lucky we are .

so that 's what a lion looks like .

i do n't suppose i could watch .

finish your tour ?

have you got that in writing ?

just that they fart through their mouths . must make kissing something of a gamble .

understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me .

i 'll be bait alone ?

where could it have gone ? how could it get across the water ? they 're only lions , yes ?

i can try .

somehow i guessed .

actually , no .

it 's all right , samuel- we all get hit-

afraid of lions .

thank you . why does he need you by him ?

get on ? they detest each other . obviously the africans hate the indians . but the indians also hate the other indians . some of them worship cows , while others eat them .

i hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul . i could never forgive what you 've done to me and my child .

time is running out , dana . soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and vigo 's . well , mainly vigo 's . but we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship .

does he ever mention me ?

that 's exactly what you said last week .

did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here ?

janine melnitz , are you kidding ? do i have a vase ? i brought some of your clothes . wear something intriguing . i brought along some interesting possibilities .

it 's janine melnitz , from my staff . she 's one of my most valuable employees .

be careful on that sofa -- it 's a butt-biter . but the bed 's good and i just changed the sheets so if you get tired , feel free . in fact , i think you should definitely plan on spending the night here .

sounds like another slime job ... no , they 're all right . they 're here now ... right ... let me know .

no , i just got in -- a couple hours ago . come on in . are we having a pajama party ?

you are personally responsible . if i can get conjugal rights , will you visit me at sing sing ?

there 's no doubt about it . he 's got his father 's looks . the kid is ugly -- extremely ugly . and smelly . you stink ! it 's just horrible . you are the stinkiest baby i ever smelled . what 's his name ?

so what happened to mr. right ? i hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to europe .

you know , dana , i 'm very very hurt that you did n't call me first . i 'm still into all this stuff , you know . have n't you ever seen my show ?

i received this information from an alien . i was at the paramus holiday inn , i was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking . then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that 's where he told me about the end of the world .

according to my sources , the world will end on february 14 , in the year 2016 .

now you 're talking .

i do n't think we should leave her alone .

tonight ?

motherhood is a very natural instinct for me . i 'd like to have a baby myself . would n't you ?

well , good night , louis .

have you made any plans yet ? you know tomorrow is new year 's eve .

not . do n't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities . we 'll be back .

i await the word of vigo .

-- the sorrow --

-- the sorrow of moldavia --

yes , the scourge --

maybe they just want to appeal .

who are they ?

your honor , may i approach the bench ?

come on , sherm . you 're my cousin . do this for me . i 'm begging you .

hi , welcome back to the 'world of the psychic , ' i 'm peter venkman and i 'm chatting with my guest , author , lecturer and of course , psychic , milton anglund . milt , your new book is called the end of the world . is n't that kind of like writing about gum disease . yes , it could happen , but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it ?

so , dr. venkman , please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street .

yes , i did . we were city champs .

yeah , you would . is that for personal or professional reasons ?

hello , venkman .

something good --

hey , i did n't imagine it . there must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there .

good idea .

some crank . looking for goat hooves . come up with anything ?

and it 's all flowing toward the museum .

is the line sinking ?

do n't tell me , let me guess . all-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the sizzler ?

this is an incredible breakthrough , venkman . a psychoreactive substance ! whatever this is , it clearly responds to human emotional states .

this is what you do with your spare time ?

if he was n't dead he 'd be an olympic prospect .

hold on , ray ! half-price ! have you gone crazy ?

careful , winston . he 's a mean one . and to celebrate our grand reopening , we 're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'welcome back ' service plan .

who ? who ? who ?

oh , hello , perhaps you could help me . i 'm looking for an aerosol love potion i could spray on a certain penthouse pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request .

oh yeah ? anytime , anytime . just go ahead and try it .

yeah , i guess so . it was the strangest thing . i knew what i was doing but i could n't stop . this really terrible feeling came over me and -- i do n't know -- i just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all . whew ! sorry , boys .

no , i 'm fine . i just got light-headed for a second there . let 's go .

and decent .

so we 'll put a warning on the label .

is it a star ?

i 'm innocent ! honest , dana . i never touched you . not that i remember anyway .

okay . i 'll take a raincheck . i always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods , but you know that . listen , that reminds me , i 'm having a party for all my clients . it 's gon na be my fourth anniversary as an accountant . i know you fill out your own tax return , but i 'd like you to come being that you 're my next door neighbor and all ...

oh , no , i feel great . i just ordered some more vitamins . i see you were exercising . so was i. i taped `` 20 minute workout '' and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and i got a really good workout . you wan na have a mineral water with me ?

really ! is it gone ?

nothing ! we just got rid of that thing in your kitchen .

you think i enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients ? i 'm making an exception because i respect you as an artist and as a dresser .

who 's the stiff ?

okay . then i 'll go .

do n't scream .

i want to help you .

so what do you think it was ?

barrett . dana barrett .

yes ... well ... i 'm not sure . what i have to say may sound a little ... unusual .

thank you .

it 's a great game ! you should play sometime . i bet you 'd be good . you seem very athletic . do you have any hobbies ?

oh , really ? well , i 've quit better jobs than this one , believe me .

of course ! ivo shandor , i saw his name in tobin 's spirit guide . he started a secret society in 1920 .

all right . i 'll try .

yeah , yeah . i was just thinking . it probably would n't be a good idea for them to get together at this point .

what is it ?

wow !

easy ... easy ... i 'm going to throw in my trap now .

we 'd better adjust our streams .

as a duly-constituted representative of the city of new york , and on behalf of the county and state of new york , the united states of america , the planet earth and all its inhabitants , i hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension .

all right . let 's cool the negative vibes . these things can sense them .

so far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a puerto rican bellboy .

so do i .

everybody can relax . i found the car . how do you like it ?

you 're not going to lose the house . everybody has three mortgages these days .

ray , i apologize . i guess my confidence in the regents was misplaced . they did this to galileo , too .

if anyone deserves it , it 's spengler and me . we 're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment .

what do we do now ?

i told you it 's real .

no , this one 's for real , peter . spengler went down there and took some pke readings . right off the top of the scale . buried the needle . we 're close this time . i can feel it .

sure . that 's great , ray . i think you should get down there right away and check it out . let me know what happens .

stantz ? you okay in there ?

judgement day ...

mmmhmmm .

do n't you think you should at least wave ?

on what charge ?

we have to stop the germans now !

i 'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the danube .

you and my father have become very close . perhaps one day i may say the same for us .

i would say there 's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right ' is .

of course , but not now . however , if he continues to be unwell , you may report to me .

maybe it 'll crush gaius .

at the opening of the month of janus , i will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship ...

how can they ? who else is there ? i have no heir ...

quintus will tell the army that you are being called to rome to celebrate your victory . they will hear that you are living in luxury . he will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life . and soon the army wo n't even remember your name .

it 's because he comes off as the underdog .

marcus aurelius has died .

gladly , caesar . and , if you 'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light .

caesar , i did my best . the colosseum is n't under my control ...

that makes his birth sign ... virgo ! why that 's the sign of a little girl ! can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with emperor commodus ?

so tell me , what happened between you and the emperor ? what really happened on the german front ? you know the senate 's arguing your case ...

my only visits to rome , senator , have been through books . but the war 's over , time to close the door of war once and for all .

god of passages and changes ?

is this rome ? are we just going to be executed ?

he killed his father and then my family ...

do you remember your epictetus , that little homily we recited when we were children ? the one that was supposed to remind us we were romans ?

narcissus ! terrified ? you ? the only thing he 's scared of is me .

you 're too hard on him . he is a strong young man , with you as his guide ...

if i 'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule i would have ... no , again , it 's my own bullheadedness . narcissus , i should have adopted you years ago . and now the gods are begging me to make you my son !

there 's no reason to say that . everyone knows you 're going to be well . i had servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light .

well , we can try ...

what the hell do you think it was about ? there 's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others .

i see the emperor 's little boy has finally caught up with the army .

when you get to ostia , use this -- bribe passage to africa or spain . save my family . you should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to egypt then to numidia .

i do n't even want to imagine the things you 've seen ...

commodus must hate you . free your gladiators and come with us .

fantastic ! wonderful ! but posters are very expensive .

they want to dump tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot , right ? they do n't waste time ...

such nobility from such an ignoble mouth . take my advice and make that bet .

as , what , 'the galloping gladiator ? ! '

what would the poster say : `` narcissus would kill for a taste of golden pompeii olive oil ? ''

i 'm not a gladiator . i refuse to fight .

legate narcissus meridas , general of the spanish felix legions ! i 'm proud to have you in my school ! now , show them what you can do !

what ?

who -- that guy at the zoo ?

i just do n't think it would work .

i might .

you wo n't ?

then you took her upstairs and you raped her .

here he comes .

no . i just sit in . they do n't seem to mind . they 've been very congenial about it .

benjamin -- i would like to know what you 're doing here .

no .

because i want to know what 's happening .

what 's the matter ?

all right .

what is the matter ?

is anything wrong ?

yes , i do .

no .

no -- why should i ?

well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son 's wedding , but i 'm sure it 's over by now . he should be checking in any moment --

plastics .

get out !

who screamed ?

will you bring up my purse before you go ?

is anything wrong , sir ?

the singleman party , sir ?

what ? oh -- no -- i 'm just --

you ca n't stop me from seeing her , mrs. robinson . i 'll find her .

mrs. robinson , do n't wreck it . i 'm asking you please not to wreck it .

well look -- i was kind of upset there . i 'm sorry i said those things .

do n't start acting hurt .

let 's drop it .

well look . i have no intention of taking her out .

so old elaine robinson got started in a ford .

really . i want to know .

but i thought you -- i guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then .

why are you asking me all this ?

wait a minute . wait a minute . so how did it happen ?

i ca n't see why you did , unless ... you did n't have to marry him or anything , did you ?

well i ca n't .

i never did , benjamin . now let 's --

well you loved him once , i assume . when you first knew him .

wait a minute . so you would n't say you loved him .

no we do n't .

thank you .

but what about the noise from the car . what if --

benjamin , this is n't a very interesting topic .

you walk right out the door .

what ?

can i take off my clothes now ?

mrs. robinson . if that 's the best we can do let 's just get the goddamn clothes off and --

inadequate !

is this -- what ?

no -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together , mrs. robinson -- would you like to go to a movie .

you 're welcome .

oh ? you 're absolutely right . absolutely . it 's 512 .

well -- goodbye then --

well -- do you want to go up first ?

why do n't i get it ? well -- i will then . if you 'll excuse me .

have you gotten us a room yet ?

benjamin -- i want you to know i 'm available to you . if you wo n't sleep with me this time --

where is it ?

is that what you 're trying to tell me ?

i do n't see why . i 'm twice as old as you are . how could anyone think --

but i just -- look -- what if mr. robinson walked in right now ?

what are you so scared of ?

have you ever seen elaine 's portrait ?

what is wrong with me ?

sit down .

like what ?

mrs. robinson , you did n't -- i mean you did n't expect --

mrs. robinson -- if you do n't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange . now i 'm sure that mr. robinson will be here any minute and --

what do you think of me ?

right .

what ?

oh -- no . i 'm just sort of disturbed about things .

is what a girl ?

how are you , benjamin ?

goodnight , sir .

about an hour ago .

well -- when did you decide all this ?

it 's pretty embarrassing . i really do n't know what to tell mr. robinson . it 's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up elaine .

goodnight , benjamin .

well this is your business , benjamin . if you --

ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked .

no . actually -- she does n't know about us getting married yet .

come on , let 's call the robinsons . we 've got something to celebrate .

i 'm going to marry elaine robinson .

why ?

i guess -- about my future .

i am trying to tell you i have no personal feelings about you , mr. robinson . i am trying to tell you i do not resent you .

i am not threatening you .

is there something i 've said that 's caused this contempt ? or is it just the things i stand for that you despise ?

because i just think you two would hit it off real well together .

i know .

could i speak to you for a second , dad ?

ben says he and elaine are getting married .

it 's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends .

i have an idea working in my head ...

how ?

i could take care of her .

have you got that skeleton key ?

no -- i told you not to come in this lobby .

going ?

then dance the next number with kringelein .

you were very different yesterday .

all right . we 'll dance .

yes ? -- tomorrow ?

did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on ? -- one that she 'd bought herself ?

have you seen it ?

whoever is keeping you waiting .

suzette will be back here any minute .

shall i see you again ?

yes .

but now , you must go ... i give you the pearls . but now you must go -- -

and then , in the war , to kill and hide . that 's all .

really , i have n't a bit of character . none at all .

i 'm not going ... you know that i 'm not going ... do you think i could leave you alone here ? after that -- ?

because i can see something in the mirror that you can not . my dear --

that is not so -- you do n't want to be alone .

a man who could love -- that is all , who has forgotten everything else for you .

i never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman 's room when she 's alone .

not quite strange now . it is as if i had been expecting you . you know , once when the grand duke was alive , i found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --

i 've no luck .

is that too much , baron ?

ready , baron .

if i could get into a game i might win some .

yes , quite .

please , baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is .

it 's always so quiet here .

good evening , mr. pimenov .

i 'm going to call the police . i 'm going to watch you play the great baron with the police . aristocrat ! aristocrat !

i do n't know .

the night clerk has already gone -- you are late .

telegrams ?

well , mr. kringelein , are you getting what you 're looking for ?

do you like me better ?

nonsense ! we 'll find a great doctor , he 'll cure you . they can cure anything these days .

oh -- i was thinking -- poor baron -- lying there , his eyes so open .

what 's the matter ?

yes .

here , hold up !

come here .

oh , yes , mr. preysing ?

tomorrow morning .

with the same friend ?

a man ? -- to switzerland ? -- that must have been nice -- for him .

moreover ...

movies ?

gentlemen , i am now free to announce ... ... that the deal between my firm and the manchester cotton company has been successfully negotiated .

all you have to do is phone for it .

we are here to discuss our merger . naturally i can make no statement at this time . we must begin at the beginning .

what ?

thank god we 're beginning at the beginning .

good morning , suzette .

yes , pimenov . one minute , suzette , i will call you .

good morning , gru -- your --

that theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- i was frantic -- i finished -- the last beat and ... ... i waited -- i listened -- but the applause did n't come -- nothing . a man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed , pimenov . we are dead -- it 's finished .

my best friend -- poor , baron -- dead -- just like that .

what is this insolence ?

oh -- you must know me -- kringelein at the plant . assistant bookkeeper , building c , room twenty-three -- third floor .

i certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one .

did i say i wanted a cheap room to live in -- when i came here did i ask for a cheap room ? did i ?

but the situation is perfectly clear , if you will allow me --

i want to dictate my statement for tomorrow . i ca n't speak without notes . i like to have things down before me in black and white .

i saw gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer i made it my business to broach the matter -- -

i know -- i know .

waiting -- i 'm waiting for news from manchester .

yeah ? you really think so ? a lot of people been telling me the same thing .

that 's right . take a little , leave a little .

my son was in the hospital --

you wan na talk to me straight up ?

good evening . i 'd like a single for tonight .

the kids beat him up , because his home life is , uh , different .

oh , cole , please . please come out of it . what would i do without you ?

every once in a while , a major change comes through . we have seven seconds to take advantage , put our buy order , our sell order , into the computer in new york before the tokyo data comes in .

mrs. dillon , your son was in some sort of accident . he 's had an internal hemorrhage , he 's bleeding to death inside .

maybe i 'll swing around los ang gleez on the way .

nine hundred . bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time . come on , lilly , you do n't argue with bobo .

you are a valued customer , as you know .

a well-rounded life . i respect that . but it has to have a center , roy , something you care about , something you can think about .

makes no difference to me if they 're only on commission . if they do n't make good money , they 're not giving us good representation , and we ca n't afford to have them around . ever supervise salesmen ?

i have to have that money , roy . what do i have to do to get it ?

well , uh ...

that 's right .

no , but i 'm goddamn thirsty . ice water ?

what ?

not any more . lilly , listen , i 'm giving you good advice . i 'm following it myself .

that 's pretty funny , all right . what happened in phoenix ?

she must have been the one that blew me off with bobo . i guess to get me running . did you tell her about my stash ?

you 're dead , lilly , it worked .

going somewhere ?

well ... nice to see you again , lilly .

i just give you your life . what you do with it is up to you .

you do not ! roy dillon ? cornball clown pictures ? commission salesman ? it 's all a front , is n't it ? you 're on the grift , i know you are . you 're working some angle , and do n't tell me you 're not because i wrote the book !

and that dump you live in ! those clown pictures on the walls !

my wife sent me here , myra . for the money . she 's waiting .

the last i looked , we were just talking things over .

yes or no . they 're both easier at home . okay ?

come on , myra , do n't talk business here . this is time out .

) if you could have seen your face when i told you good night ! you looked so , so ... ah !

what ? what for ?

take a hike , you mean ?

is that right ?

you were right , i had to get out of that hospital . nothing wrong with me any more .

oh , yeah ? thanks . how long do they say i 'm in here ?

roy ?

no question , huh ?

ate the gun . oh .

sure . let 's get it over .

not that it matters . this is the morgue ?

it may be lilly , but it is n't suicide .

we never know when and we never know why . we never know how . the only blessed thing we know is , it 'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time . just when you 've got tickets to the world series . and that 's the way the permanent waves .

sickness comes to us all , mister dillon .

we 're sorry to startle you , miss tate .

where ?

it 's blake . meet me at grand view .

one set of muddy shoe prints .

... i think it would be best if you both left .

i 'd prefer you did n't . i 'm very busy .

does n't look good .

well , dad thinks it 's okay .

yeah .

alright . i 'll come out . just be quiet .

well , i 'm not going until i talk to you .

okay ... thank you .

we 've got to get these kids out of here ...

are you going to leave , too ?

you 're right . it does sound strange .

there 's something i have to tell you both . it 's going to sound strange ...

nothing a good stiff drink ca n't fix .

wait .

have enough fun for the both of us .

very insightful .

linda , you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus .

nope . hey , you think i 'll win scariest costume ?

you think they 'll let him in dressed like that ?

you 're unbelievable .

there 's nothing to be scared of , baby . it 's just another storm . try to get some sleep .

you 've been watching too much tv .

i 'm getting the children out of here . at least until we know what we 're dealing with . john , i want you to come with us .

what makes you think he 'll come here again ?

danny ? ! danny !

black magic ... 'in ancient times , thorn was believed to cause sickness , famine and death . translated literally , it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the celtic celebration of samhain . '

here . let me try .

you stay away from him !

sam , you know you never fail to amaze me . yesterday happily retired , today right back in the thick of things . somehow i knew you still had it in you .

any word on the location of the strodes ?

i 'm here now , jamie . you 're going to live . you have to .

it was her voice . on the radio . it was jamie . calling for me .

only me -- -- and dr. wynn .

if i had n't done it . if i 'd said to myself , `` screw it . i 'm going to let all those people down there live . ''

if what ?

i know you think that .

me ?

i would n't want to be married to me . we 're too crazy . you know ?

i dunno . you know . i used to really love that alice . do you know that ?

it helped more than you know . down deep , people were deeply affected .

when i was a naive young recruit in spain , i used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings , shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos . i now understand : it was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform -- uncontrollable fear . to our women .

oh . i 'd forgotten .

when we were up in the tree so long -- with the bats .

when ?

one of them is the doctor , whose weapons are compassion , unselfishness , peacefulness -- maudlin concern .

go home !

i 've been looking at motorcycles .

something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone .

you know what gets me ?

that 's the point ! walk in there and find whatever there is to find -- before alice can cover it up .

go home .

go home ! show them how rich you are for a change !

at least !

how everybody says `` fuck '' and `` shit '' all the time . i used to be scared shitless i 'd say `` fuck '' or `` shit '' in public , by accident . now everybody says `` fuck '' and `` shit , '' `` fuck '' and `` shit '' all the time . something very big must have happened while we were out of the country .

i suppose .

no matter what you say to me , i still think you 're the greatest guy i ever knew .

out ! out !

i would n't drop my gun .

you invited me .

what ?

fifty years ?

i just want one true adventure before i die .

are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die ?

it 's mom .

she was killed in the park two months ago -- in the daytime .

the germans shot everybody who lived there , then leveled it , plowed it , planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground . they wished revenge for the slaying of the beast of yugoslavia . to their twisted way of thinking , your father had butchered an eagle scout . play lots of contact sports ?

go on .

as in `` death , where is thy sting ? '' he killed at least fifty men , wounded hundreds more .

`` the sting . ''

dad was never in england ?

big ones , little ones , teeny-weeny ones -- just and otherwise .

aha ! he has a brilliant military record , i 'm sure .

college ?

ah ! and what sort of man is this worshiper ?

you think you could find me a pencil and paper ?

dr. woodly .

anybody home ?

norbert -- you come , too . let him go , harold . let him go .

how do i load ?

then you 'd better fix your bayonet , because there are n't any bullets in the gun .

this is suicide . go get the police .

but it 's all balled up in your head with death . the highest honor is death . when you talk of these animals , one by one , you do n't just talk of killing them . you honored them with death . harold -- it is not honor to be killed .

rifle ?

things .

he had hoped that someone would be playing it still -- two hundred years from now .

i 'm dying to hear of his reaction . the thrill of smashing something is n't in the smashing , but in the owner 's reactions .

i came for my clothes .

why not ?

and no one 's there now ?

yes .

and what is his most cherished possession ?

well -- part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long , and make awful messes while they 're there .

well , i can . some injuries , spiritual or physical , can be excruciating to me . i 'm not a silly carhop any more . maybe you 're right about fish . when i was a carhop , i did n't feel much more than a fish would . but i 've been sensitized . i have ideas now -- and solid information . i know a lot more now -- and a lot of it has to do with you .

fish ca n't feel .

you do n't know you want . that 's the way god built you !

what a honeymoon .

a trip , you mean ?

say hello to your mother .

i do n't know . this is a new disease to me .

we adjust to what there is to adjust to . perhaps paul , being young , can adjust to joy or grief immediately . i hope he can . i will take a little longer . i 'll be as quick as i can .

you were well adjusted to my being dead ?

give us time .

i 'm engaged .

do n't shoot .

can i beg for mercy -- on my knees ?

you 're too modest .

i hate crowds , and i have no charisma --

poison .

king arthur .

i can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers . but he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish harold ryan with words . the truth ! correct ?

this little corpse is intended as a lesson ?

are you 've seen it work cures ?

are -- are you crying , penelope ?

i came back .

ahh -- then she 's still alive .

you startled me .

i dunno . marry the first whore who 's nice to me , i guess . get a job in a motorcycle shop . so long , you guys .

colonel harper , retired now , dropped an atom bomb on nagasaki during the second world war , killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash .

that is sad .

premature ejaculation .

you were harold ryan 's third wife . right ?

aha ! hello ! you 're mildred , right ?

what a relief !

thank god !

everybody talks about how rotten kids act . grownups can be pretty rotten , too .

and i wish you 'd quit touching me all the time . it drives me nuts !

it 's my father 's birthday -- that 's all . that 's all . who cares about that ?

do n't know .

then who flushed the toilet ?

i did n't know that .

how did she lose her feet ?

he is n't ?

maybe it 's supposed to end now . maybe god would n't have it any other way .

i 'm saying no -- and thank you .

is he coming home ?

did you see him ?

i know .

i keep having this nightmare -- that he catches us .

everything 's going to be beautiful .

you fool , you fool .

you know each other ?

he can make the sound of human footsteps -- which is a terrifying sound .

i 'm amazed .

every night , penelope , for the past two years , i 've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight .

meaning ?

i 'd be dead by now if that were the case .

oh no ! wear a coat of cotton -- wear a coat of wool .

i must take you to an emergency ward sometime -- on a saturday night . that 's also fun . i came to see selma , as a matter of fact .

i am dr. norbert woodly -- a physician , a healer . i find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society . gentleness must replace violence everywhere , or we are doomed .

minors are n't allowed at fights .

that 's not true either -- or need n't be , unless we make it true .

you bet ! `` the harold ryan fan club . '' pink , eh ? with a yellow streak up the back . we got very good tailor shops up here . they 'll make you any kind of uniform , any kind of sweatsuit you want . judas iscariot -- he 's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart . he walks around all hunched over , and he never looks anybody in the eye , and written on the back of his jacket are the words , `` go take a flying --

no . i do n't think so .

i do n't really want ... 'body to body contact . '

two officers have been assigned to the case . i ca n't keep them on indefinitely , but we 'll go through every lead .

there 's something wrong here . kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave .

the boy your daughter was talking to did n't work at the park . we 've interviewed everybody there .

big threat . tv would ream you .

if he has anything to say about it , yeah . i 've been asking a lot of questions and i do n't like the answers i 'm getting . he 's made a lot of people nervous , including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star .

i heard you the first time . we had nothing to go on with this kid . just a runaway . do you really think he 's in danger ?

wait ?

wait a minute , that 's going to cost you more than forty bucks .

i 'm getting angry .

that 's cool .

you 'll be fine .

do you have any particular choice of girl ?

that 's all you got , three girls ?

yeah .

overpowering ?

pavonine . it 's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric .

my man . 'pimp . ' i split 'cause he do n't treat me for shit . thinks he 's so cool 'cause he 's black . i once tried to take my clothes but he says , 'you ca n't take 'em 'cause they 're my clothes -- i bought 'em . ' yeah , with my fucking money ...

do n't get upset . i lied too . i do n't make no five hundred dollars a week . everything i make goes to granville .

on your own land ?

wait , wait . i 'm trying to figure this out . this is like rona barrett . before you become saved , god already knows who you are ?

i is for irresistible grace . god 's grace can not be resisted or denied . and p is for the perseverance of the saints . once you are in grace you can not fall from the number of the elect . and that 's the 'tulip . '

i can stop if you want .

you have to believe in something . what do they believe in -- the whatjamacillit church ?

tijuana .

i care about my daughter .

do n't knock it . a girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money . then you 're free . you can go off to europe , meet somebody , get married . my girlfriend 's going to buy her own beauty parlor . not me . i 'm gon na travel . 'keep movin ' that 's my motto . would you rather work at copper penny at a dollar-eighty an hour , having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you ? i can make more money suc ... doing what i do for five minutes than i can all week at another job .

what rate ?

you do n't drink ?

i do n't drink , but you can go out .

i thought you were going to bed ?

tonight . when you get out , we 'll go . why did n't you tell the other detective ?

when do we start ?

here ? what a joke . there was some detective asking about that girl .

nah .

sure . like in mikey and niki . did you see that picture ?

she thinks so . what do you do ?

who ? the whore ? no . she 's just a victim . a dime a dozen .

i just heard . who is he ?

i felt like such a shit , pilgrim , after what i did to you -- not that i did anything wrong -- that i kept investigating , poking around . there 's some poor s.o.b . in l.a. with his face all bent out of shape who you 've damaged his movie career . lucky for him , people do n't look at his face .

oh , fuck off . you should stay where you belong .

i hate it . but you got ta know , buddy . a lot of strange things happen in this world . things you do n't know about in grand rapids . things you do n't want to know about . doors that should never be opened . i 've known more about this sort of thing than a man should . do n't ask me why .

wait . slow down . a film like this , 16mm , cost two three hundred dollars , sold outright , shown in peep machines , maybe theatres , maybe not , is almost impossible to track . 'nobody ' makes it ; 'nobody ' shows it ; 'nobody ' sees it . it 's like it does n't even exist .

who made it ?

i bought it at a store in l.a .

there 's a little stall theatre up here . it 's closed now , but i 'm borrowing it for an hour . i think there 's something you 'd better see .

i do n't know .

what have you found out ?

mast ?

i suppose . but i 'll tell you , jake , i 'm like a little animal . when i get my teeth into something i never let go . if your daughter 's here , i 'll track her down .

andy .

wes , do me a favor .

i called every l.a. hotel . the holiday inn gave this as a referral number . your office said you had no business in new york , so i figured you had come out here . what 's happening , jake ? what are you doing ? nobody 's heard from you . anne 's worried sick . we did n't know if you were dead or alive .

you ai n't goin ' nowhere alone .

you wait here . i 'll find out where she is .

i want to know where my daughter is . her name is kristen , or joanne . she 's with you .

meet me here today at seven o'clock . with the money . then we 'll go see the film .

what you got in mind ?

no .

i 've got fifty thousand dollars to invest .

no . i walked up . do n't ride elevators .

well , a boy goes like this , see .

jake 'll take care of me .

no , andy . do n't know the kid .

at least i improved myself . what 's up ?

thanks .

'was . ' he and that shitheel ratan went down to t-j . maybe i should n't say that . anyway , i hear he 's back in frisco now .

oh , < u > yes < /u > ? well , that 's all right . i 've got a brother who 's a real cut-up , too . i 'll never forget the time we had this old tv set with no parts in it . well , tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family . we were all hysterical . and here 's little tommy pretending to be walter cronkite .

yes , that 's good planning . tell me , are you a regular , candy , in this computer club ?

he seems very nice . is harold interested in , eh , what 's going on ? i think it 's such a super thing to study . and then , of course , i can always fall back on home ec .

how do you do . i 'm mrs. chasen . come in .

i suppose they are in the truck . are you going to take a lot of time with this ?

lady , let me get this straight .

is n't this your vehicle ?

lady , you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone . could i see your license , please ?

harrison . harrison feed and grain ... at hamilton and fourth ... i 'm in charge of the invoices ... and i type up the schedule for the trucking fleet ...

maude , please . do n't die . i could n't bear it . please , do n't die .

why are there no photographs in these frames ?

- end where i began .

but they have .

maude , do you pray ?

and beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos .

me ! when i look around me i know i know nothing . i remember though , once long ago in persia , we met a wise man in the bazaar . he was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay . his specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin . `` the wisest , '' he said , `` the truest , the most instructive words for all men at all times . '' frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel i peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - `` and this too shall pass away . '' well , the wise man was right - if you remember that , you ca n't help but live life fully .

oh , big issues . liberty . rights . justice . kings died and kingdoms fell . i do n't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but i do miss the kings . when i was a little girl i was taken to the palace in vienna , to a garden party . i can still see the sunshine , the parasols , and the flashing uniforms of the young officers . i thought then i would marry a soldier . later , frederick would chide me about it . he was so serious . a doctor at the university . and in the government .

thank you .

oh , it 's all right . it 's organic .

well , i really do n't drink ...

an ice sculpture . it 's venus - the goddess of love , the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream .

do n't you think we should get some tools , maybe ?

but what ?

over there by the courthouse .

oooh , but they are not . look .

what do you think ?

me ! no . of course not .

she seemed yare to me .

all right .

thank you , but it 's an appointment . i really should n't miss it .

no , thank you . i have my car .

eh , no .

eh , no . thank you .

this is insane .

love ? love ? what do you < u > know < /u > about her ? where does she come from ? where did you meet her ?

an ancient japanese ceremony .

is sunshine your real name ?

i burnt down the chemistry building .

i go to funerals .

that 's very interesting , harold , and i think very illuminative . there seems to be a definite pattern emerging . your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state , your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction . what do you think ? and of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with . recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution . but tell me , what do you do for < u > fun < /u > ? what activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others ? what do you find fulfilling ? what gives you that certain satisfaction ?

i would n't say `` benefit . ''

harold !

of your kill - ears , nose , scalp , privates .

jeez ! that 's a great story ,

let 's examine the facts on it . i say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war . i say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy . hell , world war ii gave us the ballpoint pen . that 's common knowledge .

was that the one with the st. christopher medal on the dashboard ?

oh . no boxes . such a shame .

i 'm a girl who keeps her promises .

she certainly has .

are you crazy ?

so you slept o.k . ?

kirsty , i 'm sorry ... do n't understand . i ...

yeah . doctor malahide 's got her doing these jig-saws and things , though . says it 's helping to bring her out .

i have to go back . or it 'll never stop .

the past , the future , whatever this object holds .

see what ? ?

oh , right --

did n't even buy me a drink .

from where ? ? ! !

if he 's here , this is worse than i thought .

half transmission . nonsense -- german ghost stories !

no . it was red . bright red .

it 's almost over ! !

i worry about you .

how hard can it be ? i punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch ! !

you 're doing fine .

abe possesses a unique frontal lobe . `` unique . '' that 's a word you 'll hear quite a bit around here .

the day abraham lincoln died . hence `` abe '' sapien .

try not to stare . he hates when people stare .

they 're not speaking . professor broom had him grounded .

you will never fulfill your destiny . you will never understand the power inside you .

anung-un-rama ...

that voice --

yup .

we 've installed a very handy timer . set it , walk away . cable pulls the safety pins , k-boom ! easy to clean , easy to use ...

what was that ? ?

no . i never was .

goodbye .

no , no , no , it 's fine : i do my job , i take a break .

oh-n-no -- i --

those comics -- they never got the eyes right .

marco ...

but i understand what you do n't like about me . i do . what i am makes you feel out of place -- out there --

hi .

it 's nothing . just a list -- it 's not finished --

um ... liz -- i -- there 's something i 'd like you to -- something i need you to hear .

goodnight .

you better have that looked at .

hit me .

strong .

where 's my father ?

we 're leaving .

uh-huh .

you can keep them .

we 've got such sights to show you --

stay the fuck away from me .

no tears please . it 's a waste of good suffering .

no .

do n't you care ?

yes . they 'll never find us .

they took my body , but my spirit ... they left that here . in the boards , in the walls . watching the world , but not able to touch it .

you would be . they tore me apart .

it 's not any box . it 's called the lament configuration . it 's a puzzle .

a box ?

you promised me an explanation .

you 're hurting .

poor larry . obedient as ever .

the blood brought me this far . i need more of the same . or i 'll slip back ...

back from where ?

i said : do n't look .

well can i come in or not ?

you look terrible . have you had an accident ?

what 's the problem ?

kirsty .

it 's better you see for yourself --

sure .

what have you done ?

you mean we 're moving in ?

oh christ .

you know , you 're very beautiful .

no , not much .

i suppose that 's right .

well , if you change your mind . what 's this friend 's name ?

what a pretty tune .

i have to get out .

yes !

poor frank . he 's better off dead .

maybe all she needs is some company .

maybe you should give it some time .

i love you too .

i 've forgotten .

do you want me to come over ?

you 'd like the house .

what did you say ?

i found a room .

who 's there ?

sure . why not ?

i 'll come back later , huh ?

if i make it through the day .

she 's so damn ... english .

technically , i 'm number one . i went out with her a week before kevin did . her first boyfriend . me .

you got ta be kidding me .

do i know you ?

barry , you 're over thirty years old . you owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called sonic death monkey .

the little skate-fuckers .

because it 's in the big chill .

it was jan , and it was a long time after --

ooh . drag .

what band ?

ha .

... but the word `` yet ... '' yeah , you know what , i 'd get the impression that you wanted to see it . otherwise you 'd say you did n't really want to .

to me , it would mean that you 're a liar . you saw it twice . once with laura -- oops -- once with me and dick . we had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the fourteenth century .

what am i missing ? what do you have to be happy about ?

nice , barry .

but it 's my new tape . my monday morning tape . i made it last night just for today .

i do n't want to hear public enemy right now .

what are you doing ?

anna .

what are you talking about ?

`` music for old people . '' what does that mean ?

i 'm caroline fortis from the reader . i want to do a story on you .

yeah , sure ...

rob , hi , so sorry i missed your call . in la on business . you know how it gets .

yeah ... well ... i 'll see you tomorrow , rob .

rob -- !

marie lasalle is in the store ! here , she 's here , and now !

rob .

yeah .

i always hated this song .

i 'll start with your news before i tell him mine , obviously . mine is n't much , really , just about marie lasalle playing at lounge ax tonight . i like her , you know , she 's kind of sheryl crowish ... but , you know , good . so i 'll tell him before that . good news and bad news kind of thing .

can i help you ?

laura ? are you okay ?

so shall we leave it at that then ?

shut up . i 'm only trying to explain .

i 've changed my mind . that 's the most romantic thing i 've ever heard . i do . i will .

what are you going to talk to me about ?

it 's no joke . i 'm responsible for what happens , you know . embarrassment aside , there 's a lot of money and effort in this , at least by my standards . i have to put down a deposit for the room . i have to pay the pressing plant for the records , sleeve them , sticker them --

and hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and ...

but it was n't supposed to be like this . when i met you we were the same people and now we 're not , and ...

oh , great ...

c'mon . i want to know .

what about ian ?

so if you had a bit more energy we 'd stay split . but things being how they are , what with you wiped out , you 'd like us to get back together .

no , no . it 's not ... are you still on the pill ?

i want to feel something else than this . it 's either that or i go home and put my hand in the fire . unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm .

mmnn .

pig died .

are you alright ?

i ca n't talk right now .

i got it . you like sting but you do n't like gram parsons , because you 've never heard of him .

those are n't mine .

you know that i can cook my ass off when i feel like it .

ray . i hate ian .

those look heavy . where 's ian ?

nothing .

oh , rob . what do you want me to say ?

i guess .

i told you i slept with him .

so , how are you ?

will you please just go ?

you really think it would make a difference either way ?

look . maybe you 'll grow up and we 'll get it together , you and me . maybe i 'll never see either of you again . i do n't know . all i know is that it 's not a good time to be living here .

what ? gim me a fucking break . is that what you think ? that your not big enough a deal for me ? jesus , gim me a little credit , rob .

had to work it out for myself , though , did n't i ?

i think you know that .

yes . look at me . look at our -- the apartment . what else do i have , other than records and cds ?

i should be so lucky .

what difference does it make ?

what 's the -- hey , liz --

and so it is . i 'll talk to you later .

you share a place with t-bone ?

thank you .

it 's a great song .

everything go alright ?

then what are you getting so upset about ?

so so . up and down .

how 's the store ?

fine .

that 's why i 'm trying to compromise . what about fifteen-hundred ? they 're worth five times that .

look ... i ... i 'm sorry . i do n't want to be any part of this .

i must have nothing . their my husband 's .

give me fifty bucks and they 're all yours .

whatever .

uh , yes i , like , do ... it 's simple . you make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut , the master is then dubbed to submasters , which are the `` mothers , '' as their called , for each press in the plant . you press the cd 's or records , put in your cover art , and that 's it .

happy birthday .

there was this one fella . asked a lot of questions . i was out of town but i heard he spent near a full day in the records office .

taupin , richard marshall . born march 16 , 1945 in church hill , maryland . received first driver permit 1967 in philadelphia .

will i see you again ?

all of it finished .

damn you .

come here , brenna .

he knows about you .

i hope i never get that old .

at least .

i wish i could .

you want me to front for you .

our cars were seen together in felton . they 're calling me an accessory to murder .

you 're wrong .

i 'm a witness to a murder . that seems to put me pretty high on your friend 's chop list .

tradition .

i do n't know what you 're talking about .

good reflexes .

charming guy , basil . once after beating an army of serbians he blinded all but-

basil the ii .

just for laughs we raided wonder boy 's house . there was a gallon of one of the corpse 's blood in his carpet . i think it was about then i withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year .

what makes you so sure he 's the one ?

you 're an asshole , moran .

well , the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town . and all of a sudden the smithsonian 's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons .

i liked the bit you did about baltic chastity belts . too bad no one else did .

yeah .

all i need is for you to check the name .

hang on a sec , you did your little favor for the boys downtown , i 'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here .

requiem acer'nam donaei-

that is not me .

it does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds . but the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening . for it gives you great strength . the strength of _knowledge_ . the ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be .

all living things pay dues , conor . they must be respected for that .

what is the fascinatioon ? it is only a leaf .

muy bien !

again . try again .

it is as you are .

when i was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me . all thought i would die or be maimed for life . but i healed quickly . and like you i paid the price for being different .

you 're a long way from inverness .

why are you here ?

how can you know this ?

i did at that .

five years past me clan fought another over some- thing i can not even re- member .

leave me alone , conor . please .

me father has taken back my hand .

i do n't know , conor . it 's not natural . maybe something has touched you .

finish yours ?

finish your prayers ?

have you time for some- thing to eat ?

thanks .

not yet . called fbi yesterday . thompson 's going to try cia this afternoon . y'never know .

any other i.d.s come up ?

smith . carl smith .

i do n't know .

no , seriously . we used to shoot pool together in rangoon .

i love zoos . ever since i was a kid .

he always did .

i 'll never forget the look on that papal commander 's face when his `` heretic stronghold '' turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over neuvich .

sit .

what 's the point ?

my quarry grows clever with age . and the others , incompetent .

give me an address where i can forward miss cart- wright 's head .

he 's mistaken .

a mystery .

i presume it 's a sword .

yes .

steven , conor did n't die .

ah steven , it is good to see you .

i 'll send them right up .

i 'll keep you in mind .

sort of a jack london style ?

hello , bensinger .

i 'm taking the nine o'clock train , hildy . and you can meet us at the station .

did you give her the money ?

where 'd she go ?

well , the story 's practically finished . i 'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger .

i ca n't imagine who did it . i ca n't think of any enemies i have .

the check , bruce !

wait a minute , bruce . what 's commission on a $ 100,000.00 policy ?

say , what 's happened to burns ? he looks sunk , does n't he ?

he comes by it naturally . his grandfather was a snake .

i 'll come a-running , pardner .

i said -- uh -- i said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you .

and now i do n't know where my mother is . she may be lost .

no -- i was just talking to one of the guys at the office .

anything the matter ?

that 's right . -- rubbers , too , i hope ? a man ought to be prepared for any emergency .

you 'll ask me to what ?

sure , i can . look at the policy i gave him ! `` with this ring i thee wed and with all my worldly goods i thee endow : and thereto i plight thee my troth . ''

now do n't argue , hildy . how about it , judge ?

thanks .

the greatest yarn ever written by anybody . my hat 's off to you , hildy !

that 's all right , walter . it 's as much my fault as yours .

we 've certainly been in some swell jams .

when did you deliver this first ?

yes .

hello -- hello ! is this the lying -- in hospital ? did you have an auto accident in the last --

lafayette two-one-hundred .

shut up , will you ? you sure ? nobody ?

i ca n't hear ... you got who ? speak up ! a what ? ... you ca n't stop for a dame now !

who ? hello , butch ! where are you ?

if it was my own mother , i 'd carry on ! you know i would . for the paper !

i killed her . i 'm responsible . oh- h ... what can i do now ? how can i ever face him ? oh , i hope he never comes back !

you been in a fight ?

i 'm finished .

listen , did you impress it on butch that i want him and his gang here right away ? you did ? every minute counts . all right . duffy 's getting old !

all right , walter .

how much do you want on it ?

we 'll lower it out of the window with pulleys . quit stallin ' .

let me get at that typewriter and i 'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write !

well , think it then , because it 's true ! we 'll crucify that mob . we 're going to keep williams under cover till morning so the post can break the story exclusive . then we 'll let the governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him .

let go o ' me ! i 've got to get bruce out of jail ! oh , walter , why did you have to do this to me ?

well , this expert dr. egelhoffer , from new york , decides to make williams re-enact the crime --

never mind that . what 's the story ?

we 're not interested .

all right , hildy , i 'm licked . but i 'll make you and bruce a business proposition .

so -- sweeney gets twins -- and earl williams gets hanged tomorrow .

his wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord . they ca n't even find him . i tell you , drink is the ruin of this nation .

better .

all right then , come on and let 's see this paragon . is he as good as you say ?

afraid ? i should say not !

oh , better not , walter . would n't do any good .

too bad i could n't see this guy first . i 'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries .

you ca n't sell me that , walter .

do n't mock , hildy , this is bigger than anything that 's happened to us . do n't do it for me ! do it for the paper .

it 'll bring us together again , hildy -- just the way we used to be .

there 's nobody else on the paper who can write ! this 'll break me , unless -- hildy !

holy mackerel ! look , walter , that 's what divorces are for .

divorced me . it sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself . it almost gives him a feeling he was n't wanted .

how long is what ?

what ?

i 'm busy , duffy .

let 's see the money .

you know you are to be executed , mr. williams . who do you feel is responsible for that ?

are you gentlemen all through with me ?

better let us in on it , mollie .

beats king up .

say , that 's old prissy bensinger 's desk .

well , if she 's gon na write fiction , there 's nothing like being a reporter .

probably goin ' out to get williams .

i 'll call .

oh , i 'm sorry , gus ! my foot must have slipped .

you can send somebody with me if you do n't believe me !

let me go ! fellows , something 's happened to my mother-in-law .

just one second --

i 'm sheriff hartman . you want me ?

all right . tell 'em to shoot to kill .

we 'll fix that , too .

well , there 's a lot of communistic sympathizers around --

that gives you an idea of what i 'm up against !

if there was any way out ...

i wish you would n't talk like that , pete .

you can let him out on bail , ca n't you ?

oh , i ai n't doing that any more . i 'm retired . i 'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man .

i 'll go right after it .

well , hildy , we were only saying that a swell reporter like you would n't give this up so easily .

what 's the matter ? getting yellow ?

look out , you --

but , bruce , do n't keep it in your wallet ! ... well , you see -- -- there 's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat . that brings you good luck for ten years .

certified , eh ? who is it -- your milkman ?

huh ?

here !

four hundred and fifty and i 'll cut your throat if you try any tricks !

any dope yet on how he got out ?

sure you could , earl -- but you would n't want to do that , would you ? you would n't want to kill anybody .

very simple , earl .

yeah , i 'm feelin ' fine .

are you all right , now ?

i understand perfectly , mr. pinkus , and as long as i am mayor --

get out of here !

is it hard ?

for heaven 's sake , why not ?

i could n't work in the city . you see , i 've got my family in the country .

forty dollars .

look out where you 're aiming , will you ?

the door was locked .

it 's true .

so it was . sheila . this boy will go far .

ok. you 're in .

i only know one .

what are you doing here ? this is our territory

bruce , look ! dad got some german jam .

that 's not the point .

mind that shrapnel dawn thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in bill 's face .

... and six ...

did n't you feel the house rock ? you must have seen all those shell bursts .

and i 'm still just a lad myself .

i will if you will !

i do n't understand . is there any point to it ?

how 's your war , mac ?

propaganda . we 've been had .

... it was a toss-up . his company went to india , mine went to france . flip of a coin .

i was n't too old when i started the course . i was too old when it finished .

you mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission ?

you joined up .

i do n't believe this is happening to me .

you go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick .

the ideas you get in your head .

you were never apart , you and clive . he kept asking and asking . and i waited and waited for you to say something . and you never did .

it seems to have survived .

am i ? maybe i am .

i do n't mind it . it was harder before the war . trying to keep up appearances . now it 's patriotic to be poor .

it 's not fair on them . it 's selfish to keep them with you .

huh ... what cone ?

cone .

deadwood , is that what it 's called ? cool , will you show us ?

yeah , i know where that is , it 's right by my house . it 's dr. satan 's tree . i can show ya .

enjoy your last night ... ... where 's otis ?

no , i told you ...

that 's not something to joke about .

i wonder what time it is . seems kind of late .

you sure do a lot of guessing .

oh yeah , the tree .

what ?

nice .

ummmm ... two hundred and eighty-five dollars .

no , no i think it 's really interesting .

and the spare is safely sitting in jerry 's garage .

well , technically i did what ya said .

gee , ya think it would n't be too much trouble .

ok , let 's relax . i 'll check it , maybe i 'm wrong . do n't everybody freak out just yet .

oh yeah , i heard about that . i always thought it was bullshit .

it 's a hitchhiker .

i 'm not exactly sure ... it looks close . did we pass an abandoned school bus yet ?

hell yeah .

how awesome ?

i 'll pump the gas . go inside and see if it 's worth thinking about .

then the devil says , `` are you gay ? '' guy says , `` fuck no '' ... devil says , `` well then , i guess you 're gon na hate thursdays . ''

dude , talk about baggage , that ai n't no carry-on shit , that 's some heavy duty samsonite shit .

as far a hot ... goes i got ta go with ... ruth ann moorehouse .

drive through it !

well , i got some bad news and some bad news .

there 's a dog in the road .

sounds like a magical trip through the heartland .

and i gave 'em directions out there , up by the old farm row ... i figured what 's the harm . stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit .

aw , she was with some nosey , smartass high-rise kids . they were poking around ... asking stupid questions .

what 'd you see , who was she with , where were they going ?

you seen this girl ? say ... within the last 24 hours .

can i get some stamps off ya ? did you fix the toilet yet ?

nova , yeah she looked pretty sweet .

naw , he do n't do anything else with 'em , but he did get caught once with a planet of the apes doll hanging out his asshole .

yeah , does n't hurt himself , just spins it around next to his eyeball .

fascinating .

you got ta be kidding me . this chick is wasted .

hey , i 'm just waiting for cousin itt to show up .

thanks for coming to get us . little brother almost scared us to death .

i do n't want to see that .

grab mary and come inside .

hopefully i can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home ... yes , dad i 'm kidding .

bill , why do n't you ask her ... she 's your special friend .

yeah , she said we looked queer .

let 's just skip it . it is probably nothing anyway .

if i never eat at another waffle house again , i can die a happy girl .

you find something , georgie ?

i 'll bet you are ... you are a naughty little thing are n't ya .

oh , really ... ... well , i 'm a pretty good dancer if you know what i mean ... i bet i got a few moves you ai n't never seen .

oh , right .

his name is rufus , rufus jr. , but we all call him r.j .

i 'm with denise , ca n't we just walk to someplace , this is getting fucking stupid .

well , even though i know it seems childish to you all . tonight is halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner .

oh really , well i hope something changes your mind some day .

well , bill ... he 's a good guy , he 's been great help to me ... a real blessing ... i could n't have asked for a better specimen . i mean you do n't know what a dry spell i 've had , total block ... ... total block ... but bill he 's ok .

oh , you are very welcome ... lord knows how i love a man in uniform .

oh , alright ... i guess i can trust you ... being a man of the law and all .

please , could i please come in and talk to you for a minute ? maybe you could take a better look at the picture ... might stir up something .

well , i ... mmmmm ... no , i ai n't seen her , sorry .

i appreciate your cooperation . i 'm looking for a missing girl ... ... this girl here , denise willis ... have you seen her ?

questions ? well , heck , i 'll tell you anything you want to know .

well , go get her .

wait , i want to say good-bye .

i 'm the one who brings the devil 's brandy ...

i do n't know . i only saw one .

where we headed ?

what about the body you found ?

excuse me for a second .

i 'm gon na see if anybody 's home . you and mr. willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything .

sounds like a bad idea to me , probally just get in the way .

aw , fuck .

i always favored the hulk .

your spidey senses tingling .

i hope you 're right , but my guts are telling me different .

it 's embarrassing , okay ?

lila , what are you doing in there ? i need to get ready for my date .

that bitch . i worked so hard . we worked so hard , you and i. he would 've made us famous .

hunh .

that 's not how he tells it .

that goddamn neanderthal ? i 'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen ! did you know that ? !

i 've been seeing johannsen in chemistry .

well , i think ...

what for ?

please . just one minute of your time .

take me , darling ! tame your little monkey of love !

shit . hi , honey .

nothing , my darling . all is right with the world .

i am sleepy .

no . i just got distracted . i 'm so sorry .

i like it when you say my name . is that stupid ?

i am a foolish little thing . i am pink in my face , no ? it is only that i have been so lonely lately and ... i am ashamed . i 'll see you tomorrow , okay ? unless ... am i fired now ?

good morning , puff bronfman . i 'm dr. bronfman and this is my assistant gabrielle . we 're your mommy and daddy while you are here .

oui , doctor , oui .

but first i 'll live among them , just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind .

then i 'll live for both of us , lila . i 'll be the most free , truest animal in the whole forest . for both of us .

he 's dead .

nice night .

shut up , you .

i do n't know , honey . i do n't know . maybe he just did n't want to get involved .

how 'd you know where i was ?

rose , please go away .

and i think i 'm going to .

my brother says things are going really well between you and nathan .

somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine . mr. handsome , animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you .

oh yes , honey . getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over . smooth as a baby 's butt .

aha ! finally . i 've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern ohio .

and what did you do tonight , honey ?

yeah . puff and i got into a big , philosophical discussion . he 's really quite well read , considering he 's only been literate for a month now . he 's going to make us famous , lila .

should i come with ?

bravo to you , puff !

i had sold my fucking soul .

oh , baby . i 'm sorry . ca n't you hire somebody else ?

... the back door of a movie theater . yes , indeed .

i 'm sorry . please do n't be mad at me for this .

you 'd be taking away his freedom , nathan .

look at him . he does n't understand english . he moves like an animal .

come on .

perfectomundo ! we are ready ! say , would n't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block ? think of all the time one would save .

it 'll be wonderful ! i 'll show you my old stomping grounds !

you did n't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother 's stupid , tasteless , cruel animal jokes .

i 'll be out in a minute .

i do n't care . i do n't care ! like what , for example ?

oh , i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry , nathan . i never really learned those things .

you look wonderful . i 'm on top of the world tonight , lila . work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...

it looks wonderful .

quite well , really . it 's a lot of work . a lot of reinforcement , mostly positive . right now i 've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins . tiny napkins of course .

where ?

down from the tree . both of you . keep your hands where i can see them . do n't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur .

thanks to you , buddy . and your diligence and intelligence and perseverance .

i do n't think this aversion therapy is really necessary , doctor . i understand the problem .

this is great , puff . you 're doing fine .

i 'm an ape , mom . i 'm an ape . and apes do n't drop lines .

it 's open ... what 'll you have ?

right .

well , nobody has to sell .

i want to talk to you .

it 's all right , eddie . i 'm sure mr. gordon meant no offense . it was a figure of speech .

it always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind . are you sure you do n't want anything ?

will you take a check , bert ?

do you really think you can beat him ?

oh , about five hundred .

deal the cards .

could be .

i know when to quit . you do n't . win or lose , you do n't know when to quit .

all right , then . i 'll play him with my own money .

hey , bert . wait a minute !

all right . five hundred .

what 's the matter ? what happened ?

fine .

means i got confidence that he 's a loser . all the way a loser . you happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half , winner . i 'm finished .

how good is he ?

what ? and he -- he hustles pool ?

james findley is a very rich man . grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company .

sarah packard ... bert gordon .

the first match i got in mind for you is in louisville , kentucky .

maybe you oughta give me lessons .

everybody who can hurt me , everybody who can help me . it pays .

word 's out on you , eddie . you walk in the wrong kind of place and they 'll eat you alive .

whaddya been so far ?

a thousand .

maybe by that time you 'll die of old age . how much do you think you 'll , uh , need ?

i 'm buyin ' .

cut .

he thinks i care about the money . i care about you . do you care about me , eddie ? we 're together a long time , night and day . so how do you say goodbye ? you gim me the car and a hundred bucks . you think i care about the dough , the car ? i care about you . this boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw . a real high-class con man . he can charm anybody into anything . did he ever tell you how well we were doing on the road ? we had everything : we ate good , we slept late , we had money to burn . whisky , dames ... excuse me ... i 'll tell you what -- take her along .

i told you you 'd get your money back .

will you shut up ... just give me a drink .

the pool game is over when fats says it 's over .

how much we got ?

approximately ? one thousand bucks .

fast and loose , man .

i 'll be alive when i get out , charlie .

up the flagpole with the convention . c'mon , charlie . you 're into me now . i got my money on the table .

i 'm having some people over for drinks right after the races . why do n't you all come over ? then about nine , ten o'clock we can play .

i 'll bet you do , mr. felson . i 'll just bet you do .

yeah , i 'll play you a couple . just for kicks .

how much you playin ' for ?

where 's bert ?

fifty-seven .

i 'd know it , eddie . i 'd know . for god 's sakes , what are you trying to do to me ? i love you .

sarah , i 'm going to kentucky to play pool , with a guy by the name of findley . now , i need the action and i need the money . i told you i 'd be back .

first time for everything .

yes , i 'm glad .

yes , i need them very much . and if you ever say them i 'll never let you take them back .

yeah . yeah . it bothers me a lot . 'cause , you see , twice , sarah -- once at ames with minnesota fats and then again at arthur 's ... ... in that cheap , crummy poolroom ... now , why 'd i do it , sarah ? why 'd i do it ? i coulda beat that guy , i coulda beat him cold . he never woulda known . but i just had to show 'em , i just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it 's great , when it 's really great . you know , like anything can be great -- anything can be great ... i do n't care , bricklaying can be great . if a guy knows . if he knows what he 's doing and why , and if he can make it come off . i mean , when i 'm goin ' -- when i 'm really goin ' -- i feel like ... ... like a jockey must feel . he 's sittin ' on his horse , he 's got all that speed and that power underneath him , he 's comin ' into the stretch , the pressure 's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go , and how much . 'cause he 's got everything workin ' for him -- timing , touch . it 's a great feeling , boy , it 's a real great feeling when you 're right , and you know you 're right . it 's like all of a sudden i got oil in my arm . pool cue 's part of me . you know , it 's a -- pool cue 's got nerves in it . it 's a piece of wood -- it 's got nerves in it . you feel the roll of those balls . you do n't have to look . you just know . ya make shots that nobody 's ever made before . and you play that game the way nobody 's ever played it before .

is that what makes a winner ?

why did he tell you ?

would he know ?

sarah , do you think i 'm a loser ?

give it to me .

have n't you opened it ?

i 've got something in my bag .

oh , cut my finger .

i got my things over at the hotel . i 'll bring them over later ... come here .

okay . so what 's your name today ?

no , not always .

do you always ask so many questions ?

same reason you went : at that hour of the morning you have n't much choice . besides , i only live three blocks from there . where do you live ?

how come you did n't catch your bus ?

what time does the bus leave ?

since four .

preacher , gim me my coat , will ya ?

twelve . cross side .

well , you shoot big-time pool , fats . i mean , that 's what everybody says , you shoot big-time pool . let 's make it two hundred dollars a game .

hundred dollars ?

yes .

humans .

yes .

what choice did i have -- ? !

yes .

that is not now , human !

yeah , but when your mother came what 's the first thing you showed her ?

hell of a night .

need some gas ?

was there anything over the hill ?

let 's see what 's on the other side . maybe we 'll find some copper .

wow . there 's the town . and there 's the air base . this is a great hill .

is the hill ours too ?

you 'll meet new friends . i know ... it 's rough . but i have to move , son .

what 's wrong , ellen ?

why , yes . why ?

i 'm not particularly interested , < u > ms. < /u > magnuson , in what you think is correct . my wife and i are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want jimmy with us . keep him in your office until we arrive .

do n't go in .

but you saw -- the men go under the sand ...

damn .

all their lines were busy .

did you call the state police ?

we 'll be very careful . but we have to see . if something landed there , there would be a big scar in the ground . would n't there ?

this shows how to get to my home . i 'm giving you back roads and footpaths , so there 's less chance of you being seen .

yes . i can even read star maps .

do you know how to follow a map ?

yes .

oh , i ca n't remember . but people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed .

i have school .

what ?

jimmy 's father is on the phone . i wonder if you 'd take the call .

it 's really nice of you to help us .

you bet it did .

i wanted a career . did n't you ever want to be part of something special ?

you still believe in him .

you ca n't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons ?

walk to the window . right in front of you .

in case you have n't noticed , we 're in a little bit of a crisis here .

we 're losing them .

he used to run the nasa . he knows where all the bones are buried . comes in handy .

not really ...

have n't you been watching ?

what 's the bad news ?

david , david ! what the hell are you doing ! ?

it 's air force one for crying out loud . still he gets sick ?

yes . i can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the white house .

spunky ?

you think an important person like constance is going to be listed ?

all i 'm saying is they 've got people who handle these things , david . they want hbo , they 'll call you .

pops !

you have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose ?

how do you know ?

a meteor ?

dick-weed .

you 're late .

butt-munch .

look , after your shift tonight , why do n't you grab dylan and come stay with me on base .

he 's trying to impress you .

was his father stationed here ?

command , eagle one . switching to `` sidewinders . '' we 're moving in .

i thought you said you were doing to break it off .

yeah . what would you think if we went there to live for a while ?

how ' he doing ?

we should leave too .

troy 's still my son no matter how you feel about me .

i 'm not leaving .

these three died in the crash . their bodies are as frail as our own . you just have to get past their technology , which is , i 'm sorry to say , far more advanced .

peace ? no peace .

may we go home now , please ?

egyptian mail . morning edition . run !

oh , what ? ... your servant , sir .

oh , sallah ! what a relief !

what about you ?

yes . now we know .

where ?

call donovan , marcus . tell him i 'll take that ticket to venice now .

but if you want facts , indy , i have none to give you . at my age , i 'm prepared to take a few things on faith .

the name of god ...

i 'd rather spit in your face . but as i have n't got any spit ...

we 're through !

i 'm through !

as what ? a nazi stooge like you ?

my name is donovan . walter donovan .

it 's ours , indy . yours and mine .

i 'm like a bad penny . i always turn up .

yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think ?

my father did n't want it incinerated .

what are you going to do ?

this .

my room !

i said go around !

what ?

do n't wander off .

look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork .

bingo .

the last time i saw your father we were in the library . he was very close to tracking down the knight 's tomb . i 've never seen him so excited . he was as giddy as a schoolboy .

looks like the best parts have already been spoken for .

ready .

what did you find , junior ?

the penitent man will pass . the penitent ... the penitent . the penitent man ...

now , who are all these people ?

it happens to me all the time .

i did n't know you could fly a plane .

what you taught me was that i was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country . and i learned it so well that we 've hardly spoken for twenty years .

do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink ? i had a milk shake .

that 's not all we shared . it 's disgraceful . you 're old enough to be her fa ... er , her grandfather !

good .

you do n't need the diary , dad . marcus has the map .

brody 's this way .

what ?

dad !

feels like a cigarette lighter .

you said he had two days ' start . that he would blend in . disappear !

no ! do n't shoot !

yeah ?

rats ?

if only i could have been with you .

found it .

right .

that car belonged to my brother-in- law .

no , doctor jones . it 's yours !

because you 're looking for the holy grail .

why are you trying to kill us ?

as i said before , we 'd be happy to escort you to delhi .

the british worry so about their empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children .

something magical . a sacred rock .

this is a different situation , dr. jones . these people are like children . we have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century .

thank god all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing .

interested in local curios ?

who ?

what ?

finally !

his highness has not yet taken a wife .

they will escort you to your rooms now . you will be provided with fresh clothes . tonight you will be dining with his highness .

the plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible .

you understand what he tells us ?

exactly what we have here , dr. jones .

maybe ... but how do you explain the thuggee shrine i saw right below the palace ?

well , i do n't know ... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the pankot palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil .

yes , very fine . but not all of the pieces look old . some were carved recently and look like images used by the thuggees to worship the goddess kali .

a very fine collection of very old pieces , do n't you think ?

dr. jones ? the eminent archaeologist ?

lost ? no , we 're not lost . we 're on our way to delhi . this is miss scott -- and mr. round . my name 's indiana jones .

let up on the brake !

what does it mean , indy ?

just a statue .

mola ram -- you 're about to meet kali -- in hell !

that 's far enough !

that 's what you 've got these children -- these slaves digging for ?

it is why krishna brought you here .

i do n't understand . what 's happened here ?

has n't the pankot palace been deserted since the mutiny of 1857 ?

yeah -- this time you 're gon na help !

let 's go ! let 's get out of here !

a what ? !

get us out ! willie , shut up and listen ! there 's got to be a fulcrum release ! look around !

there 's bugs ! bugs all over ! help ! help me !

what ? !

please -- oh please , i 'm going to die ! get it off !

no -- do n't you see -- crawling --

five minutes ... you 'll be back over here in five minutes ...

i 've never been so hungry in my life ...

she might get away with that act here , but she 'd never make it in a real nightclub .

what about the future ?

well , when my nightclub career was run over by the depression , some pinhead convinced me that `` a girl could go places in the orient ... '' so , look where i got .

he 'll be okay . he 's a good kid .

i know the feeling ...

oh -- my -- god -- it 's going to crush me !

just one arm !

what ? !

a snake ! !

he told me they knew i was coming here .

no ... i 'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead . oh no ... i ripped my dress . where are we anyway ?

are you crazy , a lift raft ? ! we 're not sinking , we 're crashing !

siam .

the airport ... no , look out , short round ! left , left !

sending what we know back to u.s.t . via satellite .

do n't worry , i owe you a lot . i 'm not gon na let us rot here . i 'm gon na find us a way out .

yeah , sure .

you were the one who was always suspicious of her !

rene ?

dieter asked where i was . he expected me here . maybe someone was assigned to bring me here .

i can always flush you down the toilet .

we are in a dungeon . how do we get out ?

never mind that , where are we now .

what exactly ?

holy ...

are you alright ?

well ... ?



never mind , just say it .

drink lots of water .

what next !

do n't touch a thing .

wait a minute . wait a minute . al , you leave my heart alone ...

where are you going ?

osaka .

what if she says something important ?

you 're doing great with her .

ca n't tell . every time i try her , you look away . or you make noises . maybe you do n't want to know .

even rene ?

i feel like an idiot .

it is my business . it 's my name .

mind your own business .

maybe they wo n't stand on ceremony .

where are you going ?

wait .

what ?

do n't just stand there , say something .

what do i do ?

what can i do ? you 're on your own .

she does n't seem to understand .

you 're out of shape .

al , are you doing anything in there ?

for chrissakes , it 's only sand . you should see some of the stuff that 's floating around in here . that sand 's the cleanest thing in you , including me . now eat it !

why not ?

how else do you get seaweed under your nails ?

now what ?

we 'll change your appearance .

what about money ?

what is it ?

good . get to a phone .

nothing !

the man .

who did ?

we have to get out of here .

we 're a team ... my ... talent . your ... mobility .

no . do n't tell the guards .

get your breathing down . you sound like a cement mixer .

he 's not the problem . it 's the van in the back .

behind us ?

you 're not crazy .

well ... if you 're in my head ... to you , i 'm ... god !

nerve bundle ! what are you doing ? you just leave the nerve bundles right where they are .

what street ? ! we 're walking down queer street . we coming to dopey drive . we 're about to be put somewhere quiet where they wo n't mind that we talk to ourselves .

i see ...

yes .

... reporting ... .him ... ventriloquism ... on a bus

what 's going on ?

you 're not gon na believe this ...

al ? ? ? ! ! !

who 's you ?

ryuji bandaio . grown near here .

you just got a mickey .

joe go to , what the hell does that mean ? ! !

then what ?

what kind of a deal ?

i insist .

sorry ...

what a nerve !

me .

we 'll let you go . you leave the pods and the pem .

i dyed it . we 're all getting old .

that crazy guy ?

we insist .

much better now , thank you . just sit here quietly ... see there 's nothing to worry about ... just be my old self again ... .soon ...

of course you 're not . we 'll take good care of you .

you 'll feel better

i feel fine .

do n't you want to get out ?

well what ?

how do i look ?

who ... are you ?

sir ?

you did . joe no i did n't . you said something first .

he should do it in person ... i mean ex person .

we 're not moving fast enough for him .

that 's twenty feet high .

does n't matter . i 'm on your side .

her ?

i 've never met anyone like you .

it was my choice .

maybe i 'm wrong . then gruner wo n't be here .

where would you go to sell a chip ?

where what ?

what 'd he steal ?

we 're very close .

no .

why ?

you 're talking to me .

you talk to yourself .

promise you what ?

are you alright ?

you are .

you again .

must be a fulfilling occupation .

i ca n't get it out . it would take hours .

it 's alright .

why not ?

what 'd he say , how 's he know about al ?

screw the pem ... what about al ...

i heard them .

hi , honey .

p.j . 's .

get me wigand .

when 's the air date ?

what are you cooking ?

the new york times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors ! you fucked us !

you 're taking `` no '' for an answer ?

c'mon , what are you ? and are you a businessman ? or are you a newsman ? ! because that happens to be what mike and i do for a living ...

lunch ?

`` tortious interference '' ? sounds like a disease caught by a radio .

i heard wigand 's deposition got sealed .

and what are you implying ?

yes . yes , i do . yes , i get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox ... !

do you have a history of emotional problems , mr. wigand ?

yes , sir . what caliber is your gun ?

they own the information he 's disclosing . the truer it is , the greater the damage to them . if he lied , he did n't disclose their information . and the damages are smaller .

hi , baby .

use the bathroom .

an interview ! do you know what they will do to us ... ! i thought ... sorry .

why ? who said ?

try the car .

did you say berman ?

thank you , bob .

jeffrey wigand ...

i have to take a shower .

all right . see you ...

well , he may tape an interview with us . and , we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first , it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection .

that 's right ...

everything interests me .

i 'm not talking celebrity , vanity , cbs . i 'm talking about when you 're nearer the end of your life than the beginning . now , what do you think you think about then ? the future ? `` in the future i 'm going to do this ? become that ? '' what `` future '' ? no . what you think is : how will i be regarded in the end ? after i 'm gone .

in the real world , when you get to where i am , there are other considerations ...

give me a break !

i 'm going to tell you why . because when i tell someone i 'm going to do something , i deliver .

i think it was a disgrace .

i 'm with don on this .

lowell !

well , it is n't `` cigarettes are bad for you '' ...

you try and have a good time .

abc telemarketing company .

what ?

she did not sue me . we had a dispute over money ... i settled it , she dropped the complaint ... any other questions ?

b & w may have threatened litigation ... cbs is on the block ... but you , i mean , i know how ...

i do n't know what to do .

lowell , i ca n't afford --

... to talk about it . to think about it . i had a plan to ease her into it . but , i really -- i did n't know how to do that ...

words ! while you 've been dickin ' around at fucking company golf tournaments , i been out in the world , giving my word and backing it up with action .

i believe that ? yes , i believe that .

makes you feel good ? putting what you know to use ?

you okay ?

it was on c-span . yeah .

johnson & johnson . union carbide in japan . i was general manager and director of new products . i speak japanese . i was a director of corporate development at pfizer . all health-related . what else ? outside the `` zone '' ... ?

and , i 'm unemployed . so i have to protect my medical coverage . ... so i left them a message this morning . their expanded confidentiality agreement ? i will sign it .

and i do n't like paranoid accusations ! i 'm a journalist . think . use your head . how do i operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it ?

if you want to do it .

how much would i get paid ?

is there anything you want to know about me , mr. wigand ... ?

look , i really do n't have that much time ...

well , no , look ... i mean , there was a footprint . forget it . it 's probably not important at all . you know , i got a job now . i 'm teaching high school . japanese and chemistry . so , what were you calling about ?

in other words , you were charging sandefur and brown & williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously ...

a delivery device for nicotine . put it in your mouth , light it up , and you 're gon na get your fix ...

object !

and , he gets out there and he has five strokes on us . he has more concentration than anybody i 've ever met . it 's spooky how he can concentrate .

therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet howard -- i wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement .

you know , miles , after my wife -- wife 's mastectomy -- things were never the same . this might sound cold , well , maybe not to you , massey , but ... i like my women with two boobs .

muh -- well , uh -- huh ?

you 're in a rush .

oh joe , be happy for us . i 'll pay you the twenty thousand .

whoever sent you , i 'll pay double .

he was rex rexroth 's personal attorney .

doyle oil ? a massey pre-nup ? she loves him .

what ?

i should be in therapy .

not this one . not unless her hmo covers plastic surgery , which , incidentally , she does not need .

except for two years when he was in the navy , in korea .

i said yes .

you should have tried to get pregnant marylin -- solidify your position .

i thought so .

hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us .

wait ! he works for you ?

you do ? you do love me ?

hello ?

you ca n't prove anything .

arty farty stuff . lithographs and pre castro cubans . watches and mileage on private jets . stuff , miles . stuff you get from grateful clients .

comfy !

i 'd just like to pick up a few of my things

i do n't know . maybe i should grab my mace . i 'm a civil attorney . i have little experience with `` the criminal mind . ''

may i come in ?

fabric and fringe .

honey , i could sit ...

no . stay . i want you close to me . this couch is wrong . it 's not a `` married couch . ''

no .

you do ?

yes ? yes , you do have more experience ?

no .

that is bullshit ! mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho . i ca n't believe you 're saying this , marylin ! there 's nothing wrong with us . we 're attractive and charismatic and successful and ... i like us .

she did n't love you ?

and your mother was very beautiful . she must be proud of you .

you look like you were a very sensitive child . you have expressive eyes .

me . yes .

a little . you get out of the car . that 's right , fuctard . i 'm talkin ' to you !

to victory .

yes . he 's a diamond in the rough . and i have a feeling that someday soon you 'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough .

no , that 's not all .

marylin ! listen to me .

yes . i loved my husband , rex .

all right , miles . let me tell you everything you think you know . i was married to rex for a long time . i was an excellent wife , a partner , a lover , a hostess and a friend . there was only one thing i did wrong during the five years we were together . i got five years older . think he should be able to ditch me for that ?

have you ever been married , miles ?

ruth says you 've been too successful , that you 're bored , complacent , and you 're on your way down .

i assume this is on rex ?

not according to mrs. rabinow .

these are yours .

he told me to -- he said he wanted me to --

i guess .

i want to be exposed .

we do have a man for you .

yes ?

wait . i know you .

i 'm sorry , mr. massey , but i felt certain you 'd want to know -- marylin rexroth wants to see you .

please ! no calls ! i 'm feeling very fragile .

i 'll have you suspended . i 'll have you disbarred .

... the fault , dear brutus , is not in our stars ...

oh , just a routine mammogram . she said to say hello . she 's going to positano with your brother 's family .

she brought my digestive enzymes .

the fault , dear brutus , is not in our stars , but in ourselves . well , let me ask you this : what kind of settlement do you seek ? what are , for you , the parameters of the possible ?

miles massey . please sit , relax , and consider this office your office , your haven , your war room -- for the duration of the campaign .

miles .

is she going through with it ?

what the fuck ... ?

nothing .

it 's not so bad these days . kids like joint custody . two sets of toys .

muriel rumsey .

what i 'm asking is n't impossible . my daughter is somewhere between here and miami . i want her found !

how is she ?

the reward .

what 's the matter ? is n't it cheap enough ? a trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars !

you have n't heard from him , have you , dad ?

yes . peter warne .

well , under the circumstances , do n't you think we ought to call this thing off ?

well , what are we going to do about it ? where is he ?

you 've been acting so strangely since you returned . i'mi 'm worried . i have n't bothered to ask you any questionsi is n't all this what you wanted ? you have n't changed your mind about king , have you ?

what 's the matter , ellie ? what 's wrong ?

oh , yes . i heard .

well , everything 's set . creating quite a furor , too . great stunt king 's going to pull .

sorry . must have been day-dreaming .

you ought to know why . because

lower the boats !

sock her !

what would you like to have me do ?

you 've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment . well , it has n't bothered me for a minute . ellie and i got married because we love each other . and she 's proving it ; as far as i 'm concerned there 's going to be no annulment .

do n't want to talk todo n't want to talk to anybody . do n't want to see anybody .

what do they say ?

maybe they doand maybe they do n't .

i would . but i 've got a weak stomach .

why do n't you stay and watch the fun ? you 'll enjoy it immensely .

you bet i did .

better go back to your bed .

that 's swell !

any luck ?

come on ! come on !

come onget in .

you 're such a smart aleck ! nobody can do anything but you . i 'll show you how to stop a carand i wo n't use my thumb .

oh , that 's nothing . now take number three , for instance . that 's a pip . it 's the pathetic one . when you 're brokeand hungryand everything looks black . it 's a long movement like this with a follow through .

expert ! going to write a book on it . called the `` hitch-hikers hail . ''

hayin my teeth .

what 'd you say we 're supposed to be doing ?

yeah . i was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy .

really ?

here . eat your head off .

knowbut

this looks like the best spot .

you did n't give that boy all your money ?

i was never built for these moonlight strolls . why did we have to leave the bus ?

peter warne , you 've gone far enough . i wo n't stand being insulted like this another minute .

he did n't make a pass at me ! i told you a million times !

do n't get excited , peter . they just asked a civil question .

it has its moments . it got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father 's detectives . ii did it once ; actually went shopping without a body-guard . it was swell . i felt absolutely immoral . but it did n't last long . they caught up with me in a department store . i was so mad i ran out the back way and jumped into the first car i saw . guess who was in it ?

yes , you do . you think i 'm a fool and a spoiled brat . perhaps i am , although i do n't see how i can be . people who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way . i never have . on the contrary , i 've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom . would you believe it ? this is the first time i 've ever been alone with a man !

why , you do n't have to apologize , mr. warne . you 'll never know how much i appreciate all this .

well , i hope you 're not going to dictate whom i can talk to .

heyyou 're little , are n't you ?

smart aleck !

now is n't that just too cute ? there 's a brain behind that face of yours , is n't there ? you 've got everything nicely figured out , for yourself , including this .

i just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband .

hey , brat ! the view moves to the rear door of the bus . ellie stands on the bottom step .

what 'd you do ? wire one of your friends for money ?

i never thought of that .

you 're doing a pretty sloppy job of it . here 's your ticket .

remember me ? i 'm the fellow you slept on last night .

oh , my heavens ! it 's gone !

yes . tell that man to drive slowly .

you sound like a hobo .

happy ? why should n't i be happy ? i 'm getting the handsomest man in captivity . here you are , king . let 's drink . let 's drink to us . we finally made it , did n't we ?

oh , thank you . thank you very much . here .

if you do n't get out of here , i 'll slap that fresh mouth of yours .

oh , excuse me .

that 's it . dyke 's auto camp .

what ! say , listen you ! when you get back to new york , take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this officeunless you do n't care what happens to that funny map of yours .

hello , joe . sorry . just a little gag of mine . thought i 'd have some fun with you .

oh , boy ! what a yarn ! what a yarn ! get me hank on the phone . got ta hold up the morning edition .

huh ?

well , you got one now . come on , fill 'er up .

all i 'm asking is enough gas to get me to new york . the bag 's worth twenty-five dollars .

blamed if i know . i just brung 'em a trumpet .

yeah ?

if you ask me , i do n't believe they 're married .

funny couple , ai n't they ?

zeke . git !

yeahthe `` big boy '' the boss of the outfit .

that 's all right . i got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase . i 'll let you have one of them .

i 'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you do n't mind .

hey , you !

if this is oswald , it must be our third oswald .

a bullshit president ! i do n't see any weeping for all the thousands of cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the bay of pigs . where are all the tears for the russians and hungarians and chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by kennedy 's communist buddies - all these damned peace treaties ! i 'm telling ya jack , that 's what happens when you let the niggers vote . they get together with the jews and the catholics and elect an irish bleeding heart .

or a cover up ! jesus , bill , do n't you have enough proof of the fbi 's complicity now ?

i do n't know if it 's coincidence , but oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the u2 program from his days at atsugi air base in japan . six months after he arrives in russia , francis gary powers ' u2 spy flight goes down in russia . that plane was untouchable . powers hinted that oswald could 've given the russians enough data to hit it . as a direct result , the peace summit between khrushchev and eisenhower failed . i ca n't help thinking of that book seven days in may , maybe someone in our military did n't want the peace conference to happen , maybe oswald was part of that . it gets weirder .

hey , where y'at , frank ? you 're wasting your time here . big jim gave strict orders . no fbi allowed .

not unless we go for shaw now .

fuck , yes . hell , i 'm already in jail . i got no reason to lie to you . i ai n't no nigger .

julius caesar : `` brutus and cassius , they too are honorable men . '' who killed caesar ? twenty , twenty-five senators . all it takes is one judas , bill - a few people , on the inside , pentagon , cia ...

yeah .

i know this , bill - lyndon johnson got $ 1 billion for his texas friends , brown and root , to dredge cam ranh bay for the military in vietnam . that 's just for openers .

there 's a word - orders .

he had his palm print on the weapon .

lord , wake me , please . i must be dreaming .

mr. goldberg , you claim you met david ferrie and clay shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in new york , you had drinks and , under the influence discussed killing kennedy , is that not so ?

... and have you ever met david ferrie ?

it leads farther than that .

yeah , yeah . but leave me alone for awhile . i got to make some calls .

shaw 's an `` untouchable '' , man - highest clearance . shaw , oswald , the cubans - all agency .

no particular reason . just to go somewhere .

oh , it was just a spur of the moment thing ... the storm was n't that bad .

i do n't remember his name . you must understand it was quite crowded , and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the president who is dead , you do n't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are .

as a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death , was it not ?

i want the truth .

no , i do n't think i am , susie . anyone else ?

this is interesting - are you ready for this ? oswald went to see the fbi two weeks before the assassination . it seems special agent hosty made three routine visits to his house , supposedly to keep an eye on marina oswald .

bugging the district attorney 's office of new orleans ! it 's outrageous !

do n't get sidetracked ! how does he get back to the states ? that 's the point . does he have any problems ?

please answer the question .

you really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters , do n't you , mr. garrison .

mr. shaw , did you ever meet lee harvey oswald ?

naturally . are you claiming , mr. garrison , that mr. oswald also had dinner with me ?

i would n't imagine where .

i know , but mr. garrison , the fbi is just not doing their job .

mrs. mercer , as a former fbi man , it 's difficult to accept this .

that 's right . when i saw him on tv , i was shocked . i said to my family , `` that was the man i saw in the truck . ''

i 'll take them up to my mother 's if it 'll make you feel better . spend a week . i 'll change the locks , the phone lines , i 'll even get a bodyguard , all right ? elizabeth , get a hold of yourself .

honey , come on . the government wants you to be scared . they want everybody to be scared to speak out . they count on it . but there 's nothing to be scared of .

i 'm leaving . i 'm taking the kids and i 'm leaving ! i wo n't stand it anymore .

just a crank making phone calls . happens a dozen times a day at the office .

did you enter virginia into a beauty contest ?

i can not believe this . it 's four- thirty , jim garrison . i have five children are gon na be awake in another hour and ...

you sure got it . you 're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch d.a . and you 're making one hell of a mistake !

it was a texas live oak , boss . it sheds it 's leaves the first week of march . you try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker , the world 's worst shoulder weapon . no way . the fbi tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match oswald 's performance . not one . and oswald was at best a medium shot . the scope was defective on it , too . i mean this is the whole essence of the case to me . the guy could n't do the shooting . nobody could . and they sold this lemon to the american public .

i 'd say the opposite - hypertension .

... take a good look , chief , do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember ?

i ca n't say that comes as a surprise anymore .

sure , three experts and not one of them could do it ! they 're telling us oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin ' to his marine buddies he got maggie 's drawers - he was n't any good . average man would be lucky to get two shots off , and i tell ya the first shot would always be the best . here , the third shot 's perfect . do n't make sense . and then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits kennedy and connally seven times . one `` pristine '' bullet ? that dog do n't hunt .

i sometimes feel things 've gone downhill since john kennedy was killed , senator .

i keep thinking of that day , tuesday the 26th , the day after they buried kennedy , l.b.j . was signing the memorandum on vietnam with ambassador lodge .

i have n't yet . i do n't have much of a case .

well , i just hope it was worth my while , mr ...

i 'm glad you came . i 'm sorry about the precautions .

nobody knows what we 're talking about , jack .

there was one guy , i do n't know , big guy , business guy , white hair - i saw him come into the office once . he looked out of place , y'know - like a society guy . ca n't remember his name . oswald was with him .

often ? he practically lived there . it was real cloak and dagger stuff . they called it operation mongoose . the idea was to train all these cuban exiles for another invasion of cuba . banister 's office was part of a supply line that ran from dallas , through new orleans to miami , stockpiling arms and explosives .

i did n't say that . all i know is he died suddenly just before the warren report came out .

if you buy what you read in the paper .

it 's a means to an end . this war has two fronts - in the court of law , we hope , against the odds , to nail clay shaw on a conspiracy charge . in the court of public opinion , it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out , but at least we 're going to strike the first blow .

you just need some sleep , lou . it wo n't look so bad when ...

even my own wife , chief , who 's wondering where i am ?

and what would i have to do ?

that 's it .

how many men are working with you on this ?

i imagine because this is the criminal district court building this is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence . we ...

i 've done quite well in denver , mr. garrison , but i have to admire someone like you - and i have the means to back up what i say .

that sounds fun .

then you do n't stand a chance , mr. chief justice , you have a lost cause . all i want is a lie detector test , and you refuse to give it to me . because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - pentothal - whatever it is . they will not give it to me , because i want to tell the truth ... and then i want to leave this world .

yes , max , i understand .

but the only way to help you was to do that , so i did it . okay , how 'bout this ? after we 're through fuckin ' with these koreans , i take you to roscoe 's chicken and waffles . my treat .

well , my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful , peanuthead niggas outta jail , but i do it --

fuck that shit , man . i ai n't shootin ' anybody .

hey , c'mon in , man . i was just -- you know -- smokin ' a fatty , watchin ' tv .

and you did n't tell the police ?

she knows it 's my case ?

four thirty . i 'm meeting a woman .

can you do it or not ?

but now you 're telling us now you do .

thanks .

take your time .

oh , i would n't be so sure . what with all the cash , i think i could go with conspiracy to traffic .

beauty products .

what 's in it ?

arrest me .

i 'm just tired in general .

madrid or barcelona ?

they 've confiscated all his other stuff . but this one 's sorta left over . the registration 's in the glove box , the keys were under the seat ... what 's a matter , have n't you ever borrowed someone 's car ?

everybody wants him , he 's a homicide suspect . it does n't matter who brings him in , he 's gon na name you as an accessory .

that 's why you do n't make a move till i come out of the fitting room .

then you 're out and you get nothing .

in the bag underneath .

oh , yeah . i got them thinking ordell 's real nervous . they love thinking he 's scared of them .

i told them ordell 's changed the amount he 's bringing in .

i believe i said i 'd be tempted .

more or less .

hi , i 'm max cherry . your bail bondsman .

no harm in that . he 's a young guy havin ' fun being a cop . i know the type , trust me on this . he 's more interested in ordell than the money . if he 's gon na do anything suspect , it 'll be cutting corners to get the conviction ; but he would n't walk off with the money . it 's evidence .

you know some interesting people .

has he hinted around ?

yeah , we were goin ' over everything . that 's why all the bags .

bring the money in and they follow it ?

for now . these relationships never last too long .

`` american president ''

same way i been doin ' , but first they got to let me go back to work .

i do n't know yet . i 'm going to talk with dargus and nicolet today . do what you suggested . offer to help and see what happens .

you went out this morning and bought a gun ?

i felt a lot safer having it . my milk went bad when i was in jail .

what'dya think ?

if you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law , why not pack a hundred grand ?

cash poor ?

i have a pretty good idea . ordell ai n't no bootlegger and i doubt he 's smugglin ' cuban cigars . so that only leaves one thing an a.t.f . man would be interested in .

it was the other guy who busted me .

yeah , but that 's not what this was about . they were fuckin waitin ' for my ass . they knew i had that money , they even knew the amount . the one who searched my bag , from l.a.p.d. , dargus , hardly even looked at it . `` oh , i 'd say there 's fifty thousand here . what would you say ? '' but all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to customs , and i could tell they did n't want to do that .

she was more helpful than the fuckin ' public defender . i do n't know -- i guess what i need is a lawyer , find out what my options are .

that 's why i do n't quit . if i ca n't fly anymore , i 'm gon na have a bitch of a time gettin ' my brand .

is it dark ?

what did you do after that ?

you took the time to pay the saleswoman .

where 's the bag she gave you ?

you did n't . i would think with all this on your mind , you 'd wait till after .

i never have . it 's not my money .

well , it 's true , is n't it ? after this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else . what do you think ?

what 's her story ?

ever meet her , or they talk about her ?

we 've been following mr. gara , and he 's definitely working for ordell .

what are you doing ?

we 'll just be a minute .

are you getting that black suit ?

uh-uh .

who ?

i ai n't your partner , i 'm your manager . i 'm managing to get your money out of mexico , into america , in your hands , and i 'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops . that makes me your manager , and managers get fifteen percent .

can you cover that ?

i do okay .

i just came here to talk .

shut your raggedy ass up and sit down .

i 'm tellin ' you , those cops been fuckin ' wit your mind . they turn black against black , that 's how they do .

i think it 's a gun pressing against my dick .

yeah ?

how you doing , ms. jackie ?

is it this aisle , lou-is ?

lem me have the bag .

are you sweating ?

we shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it had n't been for your fuckin ' around !

uh-huh ?

yeah , that really hit the spot .

you lived in japan , when ?

no .

detroit .

were you a disco girl ?

where at ?

why should i think anything 's weird , if i do n't know nothin ' about them knowing each other ?

i did n't really think anything of it . no -- i did wonder what he was doing there , but did n't think it had anything to do with us . you know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend .

or ... ... she gave it to somebody else first , before melanie went in the dressing room .

okay , so it was jackie brown .

louis , you tellin ' me the truth ?

so you light , ai n't you . you light about a half-a-million .

maybe forty , maybe not that much .

when i see you . pick me up at sam 's . you count the money ?

i got it . listen , there 's something else i have to tell you .

you ca n't trust melanie . but you can always trust melanie to be melanie .

what does that mean ?

yep .

over half-million dollars worth of merchandise .

uh-huh .

i 'm going to wait in the car .

i got me five m-60 machine guns . these came straight from the gulf war . i sold me three of them so far , twenty grand a piece .

are you serious ?

yeah .

she will .

uh-huh .

well , bully for that nigga . you say she wants to give me the money , huh ?

how 'd you find me ?

looky here , i know you helped her and i know you know what i want . jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers . long as at the end of that story , she hands over my money . she do that , we 're still friends . now , she do n't wan na be my friend no more , tell her to think about ol ' louis . and if she tries to turn me in , i 'll name her ass as my accessory . we 'll go upstate together . hand in handcuffed hand . now that shit 's a promise , understand what i 'm sayin ' ? you tell her that , and i 'll call you back .

you still there ?

where is it ?

i got it . i just do n't got it on me .

somebody already did .

before we start talking about stewardess , let 's get beaumont out of the way first .

the bond for possession is only a thousand .

comfortable ?

man , he wo n't like that . beaumont do n't got a doin ' time disposition .

have n't a clue .

you go wait in the car . wait a minute .

we been shoppin ' . ca n't have my boy running around lookin ' like a bum on the street .

hey , hey , hey . i think somebody 's got some new clothes .

then what are you doing here ?

like della .

what do you want from me ?

they 're not interested , jake .

it 's hard to explain .

wait ... daddy .

mom , it 's ...

there was a bang .

i do n't have to do any such thing . i 'm eating my lunch , okay ?

it means that you and your buddies are whacko , that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in thailand .

what the hell is that supposed to mean ?

you need ... a doctor .

nobody 's been talking to nobody . you do n't have a case , you hear me ? it 's pure and simple . now leave me alone . okay ?

maybe that 's the only way to get through . besides , six heads 'll be better than one .

dr. carlson 's dead ?

what ? she threw me out , remember . she wanted some professor to carry her far away from brooklyn . only we did n't make it . she ca n't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in .

she says she ca n't get them new coats because you have n't sent the alimony for three months .

ah , good . now turn to your left .

i know very little about demons , ja- cob , fleshy ones anyway . i know them as literary figures , biblical ones ... dante , milton ... but jacob , this is the 20th century . we do n't see demons now .

i 've got a problem , prof. more augus- tine than kierkegaard , if you know what i mean . i need to know about ... demons .

last i heard you were offered a posi- tion in the west somewhere . tuscon was it ?

oh , you 'd be surprised . they just do n't have their doctorates , that 's all .

are you in the service ?

goddamn it ! i do n't want a social worker . carlson knows me .

i do n't want to know .

how many times have you asked me that ? how many times ?

goddamn you !

sit down , jake .

oh ? where you going ?

you can have anything you want .

jake , what is it ?

i 'm okay . i just do n't want to lis- ten .

hold me , jezzie . hold me .

with wings . you transport me , you know that ? you carry me away .

no ! what 's going on ? where 's my family ?

reasonable ? reasonable ? jake ... you 're gettin ' me angry .

no . things are too hot . later . i 'll send for you .

it 's amazing , you know , that a drug could change things like that , destroy a life and then give it back . it 's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next .

what 's gotten into you ?

hello ... no . he 's not here . i have n't seen him all night ... i do n't know when ... what ? tell him what ? vietnam ? ... what experiments ?

he said you did n't have one .

it 's gone to the top .

hey , i 'm here .

we 're at della 's .

why do you bring her up ?

i do n't know . one of these days , i 'm gon na see louis . my back 's killing me .

what 's wrong ?

how 's it going ?

look at her face . a real bitch .

what do you mean you can see ?

they 're biblical . they were prophets .

who ? jed ?

no . have you seen my glasses ?

you up ?

what ? you want the plaza ? do n't be foolish . here . take this , too . this is my place on prince street . it 's got my phone , everything . call if you need me ... but you wo n't . everything 's gon na work out . you just get outta town as fast as you can . the new york police can be effective when they want to be .

glorious . i 'm not surprised . i fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven . i 'm just glad you came back .

one drop ?

the truth can kill , my friend . five hundred men died out there . this is n't a story they 'd ever want out . when paul 's car blew up i realized the scope of the thing . i knew they meant business .

surprised , huh ? i told you you 'd know me . i 've been tracking you for a long time . i just wish i 'd spoken to you before tonight .

that 's what i 'd like to know . if you see him on the street somewhere , tell him he 's fired .

excuse me , do you know if we 've passed nostrand avenue yet ? excuse me . look , i 'm asking a simple question . have we hit nostrand avenue ? i fell asleep .

for what ? for seeking the truth ?

this is not a dream ! this is my life .

last night ! they were as real as you are !

we 're doing everything we can .

yeah .

i do n't know .

you tellin ' me ? how many times can you die , huh ?

count 'em on one hand .

pour it in .

bring it in .

yeah yeah i better call the labs , see what the hell is going on .

alright , asshole .

yes it does .

watch it punk , i 'm armed .

remember , stay calm , use your thrusters . we 'll be fine .

done ?

we made it ?

if the ship goes , so does jaso .

just make a break for the door . he 'll get some of us , but that 's the breaks .

where have you been ? ! !

i 'm coming , i 'm coming .

thorgan , quit screwing around and come on !

what are you gon na do , tell me ?

rizzo ! can you hear me ? !

where 'd you get the gun ?

it bought us some time .

i do n't give a shit . this one 's prime for decryonization . we 're brining her back .

damnit , yllo ! i do n't like it .

not an option . i 'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down .

lab two , relax . what 's the matter ? he 's dead .

teach ! where the hell are you ? ! where 's our visuals ? ! !

pull me in !

no thank you , you crazy old woman .

eat me .

where are you going ?

we must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey .

more time ... shit , she 's had 400 years ...

i ... i do n't know what i did ...

and what 's with the headgear ?

maybe she tripped .

you killed him ?

no ... that 's the sound of the men working on the chain gang .

you need to get laid !

i am now . i missed you , thorgan .

you did good , kay-em . i 'm proud of you .

kay-em , you okay ?

sorry , sorry .

it 's just you and me , then .

now wait a minute ! i do n't think you should open that door .

what ?

it 's okay , he just wanted his machete .

why do n't you get it ? he 's going to kill us all !

of course he is . he 's the most relevant find in 400 years ... except for you , of course . look if you 're worried about pr do n't be . you 're walking and talking . he 's a stiff . you 'll get the publicity .

we need to do some tests ... i 'd like to ask you a few questions .

jason ? ! where is he ? !

nano ... but nanotechnology is impossible .

listen up duck fuckers , you ca n't kill this thing .

no ! no ! no ! swing around ! after him !

c'mon . middle appendix --

you hired me , remember ? it 's my $ 10,000 . it 's my shark ...

we got a barrel on him . we ca n't lose him . we stay out here until we find him .

what do we do ? get some help ? radio in ?

what i do is trick him to the surface , got that ? then i can jab him , understand ? think i 'm gon na haul it in as if he 's a catfish , like everyone else does ?

do n't tell me my business ! quarter-mile , that way . full throttle .

it 's my charter . my party .

what 'll i tell the kids ?

i 'll see you back soon . there 's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks , and there 's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit .

can you do that ?

thank you .

like you 're from n'yawk .

my kids were on that beach ...

we have got to close the beaches . we have got to get someone to kill the shark , we need non-corrosive mesh netting , we need scientific support ... it 's gon na cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have .

larry , if you 'd see these clowns leave , you 'd never believe they 'd come back with anything . but they got him !

i ca n't stand here doing nothing !

it 's a whale out there .

what 's that , a ship ?

out there is a perfect engine , an eating machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that 's all . look at that ! those proportions are correct . i know sharks .

we will . there 's something i 've got to find out .

how can you tell ?

what ? what ? !

yeah . like the kid on your beach . i wish i could 've examined that shark they caught ...

dynamite ! how was your day ... ?

pretty stiff .

what d'you pay for a place just for the summer ?

christine what ?

what 's the matter with my printing ?

get out of there take these back to the office and make up some 'beach closed ' signs , and let polly do the printing .

i ca n't believe that people pay money to go fishing . this is really dumb . this is n't even relaxing ... it 's just boring .

screw lamb -- let 's shoot the sirloin !

you wan na call it a night after here ?

you love sharks ?

so would i. come on in .

hi . i 'm matt hooper . if your husband is here , i 'd like to talk to him .

he 's busy .

i just wanted to know if you were all right ... the coast guard let me use their radio . is chief brody there ?

power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate . if i can hit him . i can kill him . but i got ta be close . very close .

he 's under !

and i 'll drink to yours .

ever see one like this ?

aye , aye sir . stand by to repel boarders . poop the mainsail . argh , jim boy .

nothing . nothing , nothing , nothing .

who 's inside , you or the shark ?

i 've been to sea since i was 12. i 've crewed three trans-pacs --

that 's it ! i 'm standing here arguing with a guy who ca n't wait to be a hot lunch . goodbye .

i do n't have it .

that 's disgusting ! this is the largest , meanest , most vicious shark ever landed off amity island , and a known maneater !

you 've mentioned it about fifty times .

that 's all i need from you . that 's more than i could ever ask for . you 're just golden , dude .

i think it 's because my heart starts pounding when i see you .

what ? are you ashamed that we did it ?

yeah , i did ask her if she wanted to go . a bunch of us from the team are going to benihana , then the prom , then vijay 's parents ' cabin .

jesus , bleek .

oh , i could n't copy your work .

my mom uses color-safe bleach .

me neither . but i 'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count . see you .

they could be utterly negligent . maybe they 'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would . have you considered that ?

you 're not going to be a pop-pop . and juno 's not going to be a ma . somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from jesus in this garbage dump of a situation . i friggin ' hope .

oh , go fly a kite .

the term `` deliver '' is so weird . can we not say `` deliver '' ?

so , juno . first off , how far along are you ?

yes they are , josh . since mankato , they have been lying eyes .

you know , you 've been acting like this ever since i went up to see my brother at mankato . i told you , nothing happened !

god , you 're so young .

please do n't get a divorce ! god , mark , just do me a solid and stay with your wife .

this is n't what we agreed on . you guys have to take care of ... this ! you are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump !

oh man , i can just picture you slow dancing like a dork !

yeah , this song 's older than me , if you can believe that . i danced to it at my senior prom .

you do ?

cute ?

hello ?

why ? what the big deal ?

oh yeah . it 's herschel gordon lewis . he 's the ultimate master of horror .

the wizard of gore ?

i know what junk is .

yeah .

nuh-uh , 1977 ! punk volume 1. you were n't there , so you ca n't understand the magic .

blood and guts .

whoah . i do n't want to see pictures . i do n't need to be notified of anything . ca n't we just kick it old school ? i could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way . you know , like moses in the reeds .

so , let 's discuss how we 're gon na do this ... thing .

wicked pic in the penny saver , by the way . super classy . not like those other people with the fake woods in the background . like i 'm really going to fall for that , you know ?

congrats .

my partner uses these every time we have intercourse . they make his balls smell like pie .

well , of course . your old d-a-d ! you know i 'll always be there to love and support you , no matter what kind of pickle you 're in .

i 'm losing my faith in humanity .

did you say you were thinking about adoption ?

maybe you 're having twins . maybe your little boyfriend 's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice !

prom is for wenises , anyway . once you 're old enough to go , it 's not cool anymore .

i wish my funbags would get bigger .

right , seriously .

you sound shocked or something .

the penny saver sucks .

maybe they 'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to cabo san lucas for spring break .

oh , gruesome . i wonder if the baby 's claws could scratch your vag on the way out ?

so , you were bored ? is that how this blessed miracle came to be ?

well , are you going to go to havenbrooke or women now for the abortion ? you need a note from your parents for havenbrooke .

is this for real ? like for real , for real ?

well , have n't you ever felt like you were born to do something ?

you do n't say .

it 's a loft .

i know we 're prepared . i just do n't know if ... i 'm ready .

well , i do n't mean to be a pest . it was just that i was looking at you . and you look upset . i liked looking at you , but your face looks upset . and i was wondering if i could be of any assistance ? maybe i could cheer you up or somethin . help make you happy . who knows ? somethin ' maybe .

four-thirty in the morning ?

nah .

you want a wip-it ?

you set yourself up tonight when you attacked kathy , you crazy fuck !

you ever do any hunting , peter ?

you think you 're going to catch him on a trace ? everything he does is planned out well in advance . the only way we 're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up .

not what -- who . morpheus . the greek god of dreams . look at the next line . `` her god has gone and left his home . ''

meaning , it looks like his victims are chosen at random .

that 's crazy ! why would i draw attention to myself like that ?

you are ! i do n't like you .

what are you saying ?

sanderson ?

check with the state . if he 's never killed outside of washington the f.b.i . would n't have it . nolan ?

he 's one of the best chess players in the world . who better to play a game with ?

i was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but i 've decided it 's better if you do n't know exactly when i kill her . good-bye peter .

no . as usual you 're wrong . it is her i want . killing you would be easy . living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat .

the game 's over . you lost .

by that time the game will be over .

i could n't tell you that . it would ruin the game . not that you 're playing it very well .

i did another one last night . you might have saved her , but you did n't want to play .

no , only the path she chose to travel .

yes , i do . i found your file . i know what happened .

can we correlate data ? look for specific things , like player 's ages ... stuff like that ?

you 're losing me .

yeah -- that 's what we 've always thought -- but what if he was n't ? what if i had nothing to do with the reason he came here ?

why did he ?

the police came to me for help . what could i do ?

i 'm kathy .

you ready ?

has he gotten through to any ?

that has nothing to do with it .

same as the others ?

i 've got a room at the institute i use when i stay late .

you do n't have a shred of evidence !

and what if he 's wrong . if you were one hundred percent sure it was peter you would 've arrested him . if it is someone else then he 's going to kill again tonight and you 're sitting here ignoring the message .

yes . why disguise your voice if no one knows it ?

it could have been a tape . a prerecorded conversation between sanderson and himself .

it 's important .

it 's over , peter . let 's stop the games . i 'm not sending a car .

how can he be playing chess with you ? you 're not making any moves against him .

we 've already met . have n't we ... doctor .

she called to give me my schedule for tomorrow .

here . i played gregory lutz .

yeah . just let me grab a shower .

what do you see here ?

whatever 's on your mind .

you 're always in the middle of a match .

i suppose you have something in mind ?

what are they , please ?

you beat him .

he did n't tell you either .

frank told me .

because she killed herself ! !

but i do .

you 're wife died . you ca n't feel responsible for that .

peter ...

because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid ?

in a fierce magazine you 'll find a hint of my actions to come ... why does he set this line apart ?

i thought you said the line was busy ?

you can turn everything around so easily . this is not just another game , is it ?

you 've got to face the things you feel .

have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games .

oh , but it is . he 's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him . that 's a game . it has rules and objectives .

you sound like my mother .

it 's going to be a long night . it could take hours before we know something . you should try to eat .

what are you looking for ?

well , i think i 've had enough .

it seems like such a complicated game .

because i love them , but they drive me crazy . you know how parents are ?

i 'm not nervous .

all directions are the same here .

well , you 're beautiful .

me too .

you do n't understand . i 'm just so < u > relieved < /u > . i was < u > sure < /u > you 'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy .

i must follow the slayers . they 've taken lyssa .

you 're coming with us .

no . we will find another way to locate the fortress .

she was very faint . i was barely able to reach her .

the fortress moves ?

but there is another entrance to this place .

i found the body of the seer in the stream .

one night is no betrayal . have pity on me . please , i beg you , do not refuse me . you do not know the price .

i can not take comfort when she has none .

i do n't think that .

i have need of friends .

he saved our lives .

colwyn , do n't be a fool . you ca n't do battle with that thing .

naturally .

lad , you have an unnatural desire to pay for things . it stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination .

you 've eaten nothing .

i 'm not hungry .

they burn many villages . even walled cities fall to them .

i compel no man to follow me on this journey .

no .

tonight and every night , my friend , for this is the second time you 've saved my life . i am ergo the magnificent , short in stature , tall in power , etcetera , etcetera .

i do n't think it 's working .

i 'm hungry .

they 'll trample him to death !

he will not come . you will be my queen .

then he will die !

they will have the life that you and i might have had .

i knew .

it is important to assure the succession .

lord rowan is one of lyssa 's godfathers . he will defend her in the ceremony . i wish that lord modred were here . he is a godfather of her own blood .

the dark ones will appose you with all their power .

go now . quell was wise . he knew that a man can not ask more of his death than it help his friends .

we must reach the valley of reeds before the next dawn .

she has the power of vision .

there 's an emerald circle a few leagues from here . we 'll find her .

you will come with me .

you can not stop time . go now , before it runs out .

then the other lyssa will share your fate . she will grow old in the fortress as you have grown old here .

you lie !

do not try your trickery on me !

yes .

... not at all .

stop , mathilda ! do n't talk like that !

there are just two things i 'm interested in : love and death . for the moment , i have none of the two !

... shit ! ! we 'd found him . we waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window .

of course , so kiss me quickly , or they 'll notice us .

... this is what i do n't like , you see : you do n't refrain me , but at the same time i ca n't get out !

you see , five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me ... but i prefer this !

it 's incredible ! how did you do it ?

the yellow and pink .

wow ! it 's brilliant !

what if you ca n't approach the car or he changes car ?

huh ... 500 meters ?

... one second .

excuse me , mister ... i 'm looking for mister rubens ' apartment , but it 's dark out here and i got lost ...

yeah , but he 's not exactly my father ...

is he still alive ?

he probably just went somewhere .

i 'm completing the walk . i 'm almost there .

if you ca n't redo these six hundred miles when you 're rested and ready , how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition ?

no it 's not .

a couple days to a few months if untreated .

when i was ten , my family lived in pacifica for a year . i used to go to the beach everyday that summer . i never felt so happy , carefree . it was a magic place for me ... that 's where my heaven will be .

did you have a dream ?

i think it 's a different place for each person .

no it 's not . he should be here with me now , not trying to find some fucking bottle of johnny walker . he 's never been there for me . i 've always been alone .

you can change .

i 've changed my mind .

please tell me .

i do n't follow .

you do n't have to prove anything to her .

and that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them .

his name is maurice . he 's dancing around everything else .

that 's me .

there was a boy named isaac who wanted to play baseball , but he was too small and no one would let him play ... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting ... he went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove .

you know what ... i remembered you were here and i woke up .

maybe .

what are you saying ? this story is too big for this paper ?

do n't do this .

are they standing ?

i have n't been too punctual with the rent .

ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast ... everyday . now that 's about a quarter mile each way ... 17 years ... that comes to about three thousand miles ... and you know what kris ?

why know ?

she knew you loved her .

write from your heart . that 's why the classics are great .

pulitzer , here i come .

which hospital ? did you take me back ?

what ? who are you ?

water .

one drink minimum per show . everything 's ten dollars . now ... tell me what you want or i 'll eighty- six you .

no .

they would n't know .

ok , but remember that they wear it because they have to . i wear it because i want to . that 'll make me look different . let 's get a drink .

you were ok for a while , so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck , but i think even you knew that was n't going to happen . we got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store , even though i told you that we had plenty at home . in the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change . i asked you if you knew it was a hundred . you said you did , so i let you do it . we got here , you fell asleep on the couch and i covered you up and came to bed .

how are you doing ?

tomorrow night as a matter of fact .

then come . i 'm going to change . watch tv . i 'll be half an hour .

sera , i love that name ... s.e.r.a . before we proceed onwards , there is something i need to say . ok ?

ben ?

you can never ... never ... ask me to stop drinking . do you understand ?

let 's face it , ben , we 're having fun here . i 've never done so much talking in my life .

first . it 's our first . i 'm just concerned . so ... why are you killing yourself ?

i 'm rambling . i really like you . you make me want to talk ... i do n't know what time it is .

you ok ?

you ok out there ?

this is the home of an angel .

are you serious .

if i was i 'm sorry .

yes , that 's right .

of course .

what did they look like ?

do i look that obvious ? my name 's paul .

i will keep you safe . we are both older .

i have a 4.0 .

are we done for today ?

to me it is . he does n't trust me . why should i trust him ?

enrique 's gay . i 'm sure of it .

who could better understand than me ?

no .

because they got wet .

did you hear a shot fired ?

not that i saw . but like i said , i went straight upstairs to take a shower .

i do . i 'm not allowing it .

yes , i am .

i 'm sorry , but --

good work today , ms. woods .

what are you talking about ?

just the love in my heart .

so she was distraught that her husband was dead ?

forget it . i 've already spent too many hours crying over you .

i do n't know .

i think so ...

have you ever considered asking him if he 'd like a cold beverage ? or perhaps a neck massage ?

is she as pretty as you ?

you 're asking the wrong girl . i 'm with my guy eight years and then one day it 's `` i met someone else . move out . ''

after you went to all that trouble ?

i 'm her sister .

licensed attorney or family member ?

i know . i thought that was very -- classy of you .

i believe her , too . i do n't think she 's having an affair with enrique .

although mr. huntington makes an excellent point , i have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life ?

i ca n't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important . i 'll make it up to you after finals , okay ? i -- promise . i really want to do a good job .

keep june first open -- you 're one of my bridesmaids . and give warner our love .

up for a celebration dinner ?

that 's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should .

no , she ca n't move for an hour .

and d ) brooke is obviously hiding something .

aside from that .

uh , for starters , she wo n't give us an alibi --

my money 's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife .

well , in all likelihood , she 's completely guilty as well . she was seen standing over her husband 's dead body .

you know -- mixers , formals , beach trips .

uh , no . maybe you should try the lido deck .

i gave her my word , warner .

if you tell him , you 'll probably make summer associate . who cares about brooke ? think about yourself .

i did n't mean --

that 's because i spend all my time with case studies and hypos .

you go where ?

no .

yes .

i ' m sure that was very awkward for chutney . much as it is for me , hearing you tell about it .

so , i hear the tart from california shot heyworth .

you passed spanish because you gave professor montoya a hand-job after the final .

you 're right . phew !

fool 's magic .

birdies ... pretty ...

delusion ... a kind of magic which works against the magician .

now i want to live forever . i 've never felt so strong or happy .

and i with you ... i never dreamed life held such pleasures ...

might we watch , too ?

you 're a beast !

what will become of me then ?

yes ?

and then ?

your moans seem almost pleasurable , my dear ... developing a taste for the lash ?

jack ... oh , jack ... help me ...

i 'd soon die .

why have you brought me here ?

then why hide behind a mask ? you are ashamed !

oh , no , never ... nothing like that ... never crossed my mind .

you come stealee tleasoo ?

where 's your joy if you can not sing ?

i 'm not denying it 's a joyous day --

do n't get too far !

tis a delicate operation , lad . requires a bit of engineering ... next !

mean you to seek him out below ?

the wound is mortal .

nonsense ! course it matters .

never mind . just do it ! retrieve the arrows somehow .

wait !

i pray always to be worthy of it .

gump , you 're putting words in my mouth .

my god ! look !

aye . said to follow it to the edge of night . but is this the right bird ?

careful , lad .

there be no finer victuals than worm flesh , lad .

the princess is dead .

do n't get caught , that 's what ! she 'll suck your bones like honey- comb .

are we here ?

jenny greenteeth ? who 's she ?

course we care . what good 's the world locked in a season of death . frozen up , no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer 's night ; no babies to tickle ; no more spells to cast ... think that 's an enjoyable prospect ?

do n't you care about what 's happened ?

if you 're looking for enchantment , jack , that i can give thee ...

do n't you know ?

aye . honeythorn gump 'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer .

generally known ! what general ever knew more than to lace up his boots ?

well ... i ... i do n't want to be rude , but ... it 's generally known that --

and how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk ? is me music not to your liking ? mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure .

how 're these ?

rise , screwball , and into the basket with you .

aye ... my lord ...

screwball ! be quiet ... ! we have friends live 'neath the needle . they 'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night .

keep me belly full , jack . kill us another worm .

i ca n't see a thing .

but ... i am a green man . i have no title , nor lands ... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body .

sweet jack . i 'm so sorry you found me asleep . do n't know what came over me .

oh ! green jack ! what a dream i 've had ... proper nightmare .

that 's why he goes masked during the day ...

sunlight ... it destroys him .

what if i answer yes ? will my wish come true ?

do you wish it , jack ? wish you this our wedding band ?

if i were your bride , would the kissing ever stop ... ? do you wish to marry me , jack ?

not even the birds sing sweet as you .

i did n't know ... i did n't ... it was so lovely ... he was in my lap like ... like a baby ... and ... i ...

what happened ?

not if you be chaste . tis an awesome test of virginity .

i am a princess . you have no right to order me about .

all right . i 'll show you something sacred .

sport , indeed .

or perchance ...

another hero 's hand-me-down ... thurgis , note the armor ; tis greek work .

what a fine meal you 'd make , be the rest of you sweet as your tongue .

as a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom .

nay . tempting as your invitation be . tell me one thing more .

couer de noir ! a demon if the devil ever made one .

the moon is too round of face , methinks .

think me fair , do you , jack ?

i bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness ... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty .

heading north still ?

wondrously so .

i had no thought of offending you , oona .

never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday .

were i a mortal girl , jack , methinks i 'd be in love with you .

this is not the time for squabbling .

maybe there 's a better idea ... what about birds ... get a lift from some friendly bird ...

in a dream .

much good we do the world , for all our noble quest ...

no hurt jimmy , sir ... oh no , please , sir ...

it 's so beautiful .

i checked everywhere . he 's not there .

we can work .

he has n't called ?

who are all these people ?

i do n't know ... more like when i kissed sam .

i want you to try something with me , okay ?

i had them in my pocket .

is that legal ?

sorry i got you into trouble .

where are you ? !

i do n't wan na go .

you 'd hate him for the trick .

hey , i can get you three hundred cash for two hours .

what are you talking about ?

are you sure you 're totally into guys ?

he can peddle over anytime he wants to for it .

his parents took his car . they 're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer .

turn over .

no . that 's okay .

i ca n't even take a shower here .

i do n't know .

i 'm supposed to be in tahoe .

he wo n't leave my room .

he 's at work while i 'm here .

just , i mean , well , you 're here every single day .

he wants the entire roof taken off and lowered .

george just never really ... aimed that high . even with not hitting a rabbit . i knew you were doing that , by the way . that 's why i stopped doing it with you . you were no fun . it was always like you were frightened . quiet and boring .

this is such a street of whiners .

that would take weeks .

if that 's what it takes .

i 've been dreading you .

from the day i started ... to today . ca n't stand it .

maybe that 's too long .

oh ... nothing . thirty pounds . i just have n't been very hungry .

i 'm sorry .

she did n't really say .

is alyssa home ?

george , this is the third time .

i do n't know what that means . what kind of problem ?

everything would have been better if you had . you 'd have liked your grandmother . and there 'd be a girl out there that 'd have her mother . i remember reading about her in the paper . they could n't find her father and her mother was dead . i still feel guilty about that .

we have n't build shit . you 're just tearing down your father .

do n't . i do n't want it .

twenty years of hating what you live in ... what you are . this is the end of it , sam . i 'm gon na build something of me here that i can be proud to give to you .

the gloves on the table are for you .

i 've been using since i was twelve ! you 're all so unbelievably stupid . you did n't give a shit about anything i did until now !

i might have a solution .

it 'll be fine .

goodnight .

probably in the bible .

are you totally insane ? !

good for you .

we just were n't very much alike , i guess . i do n't know . i liked your dad more than i liked you .

three .

what ?

back . neck . back .

let 's not do this , okay ?

i 'm married .

going on ?

what is it with this ? they would n't spend less time with peter if they lived here ! he has no time !

it 's just that there 's less that adam and ryan can do anymore . i 'd hate to have them bored .

maybe you should n't come everyday .

or wound . let them keep their eyes and fingers .

you head was pressed against my chest . i could feel your heart racing . and i remember i kissed your hair .

george --

i did say he could go .

hey , hey !

no , you do n't . trust me .

not for the weekend . for the summer .

why would they tow your truck ?

you 're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion !

you should lock your doors .

it 's just a joke . a stupid joke .

he already knows everything about what he ca n't do . you can tell him not to even look at you , if you want .

she would n't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen . i mean , that 's not even a rule , just her own thing . she like figures things out on her own and then that 's it .

i was n't sure .

no .

the payoff .

i feel in love with george again .

i know .

so am i , robin . i 'm working at something , too . i 'm even talking . do you want to be around for it ?

i ca n't go right now .

to shave your chest ?

what would you be if you asked adam and ryan to run in now and hug you ?

it would worry me .

a man he respects .

either do you .

i guess i could teach you some things .

you got a dog ?

nigger .

no , nigger .

is mae rose okay ?

we played down in jackson yesterday . heard a rumor you 've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton .

well , alright then . what do you think about this new tie ?

oh , no , ray . not tonight . spanky 's not happy with you .

i 'm too old for you . besides , i 'm not much in the mood .

she 's alright , is n't she ?

goodnight , mr. wilkins . mr. pike .

yes , boss .

here !

i know you 're not talking to me ...

gim me that damn thing .

you did n't get ketchup ?

just put some mustard on it and eat it .

do n't call me soft , i hate it when you call me that .

what 'd you say ?

i know . simultaneously , they shake and zip . claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo , placing it on a tray next to an identical one .

i do n't like it , i do n't like it one bit . we shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity . we 'd be half way to new york by now .

damn , it was getting hot in there .

you and wilkins sure are getting chummy . you two planning on going steady , or something ?

i know , but since we 're talking , i thought i 'd mention it .

that was five years ago .

well , if that 's the way it is ...

my plan is on his way to pittsburgh right now . that congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us , but we ca n't seem to do nothing for ourselves . do n't you feel a little disgusted right now ?

i do n't see you coming up with any plans .

i 'm not gon na let it go . the man needs to explain himself . makin ' promises .

you want to hit ? yo , claude . give ca n't get right a shot .

hey , man , is babe ruth in the lineup today ?

absolutely . the map is very clear .

new york 's a long way 's off . let 's just keep moving , okay ?

i 'm sure it do n't .

getting a map from a chubby chef named cookie ? dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat ? that ai n't a plan , that 's a vacation for two in the hole . when you 've got a map to new york city , you get back to me .

what do you know about boats ? i bet you ca n't even swim .

cookie drew me a map to greenville .

spanky 's gon na be pissed ? poor spanky . fuck spanky ! what the hell kind of a name is spanky , anyway ? you 're responsible for this situation . i blame you for everything . if it was n't for you , i 'd be home having a hot meal right now .

hell with him then . if he ca n't share the driving , he ca n't ride in the truck .

he even got my daddy 's watch .

there are people down there having fun . i want to be one of them . i want you to be one of them . on monday you can be a bank teller if you want , but tonight you 're a bootlegger with a truck full of puerto rican rum and a fistful of cash .

what are you complaining about ? it worked out . everything 's cool . now , come on , let 's head down there and see what 's shaking . we deserve a little reward .

yeah , i want some pie .

i call it like i see it , and what i see is definitely soft .

what 'd you say ?

like this ?

that 's right , a loan officer .

do n't i know you ?

at least he did n't kill santa claus with his bare hands .

what is that ?

life , huh ? they step outta line again , we 'll shorten up that sentence real fast .

looks like we got a couple of live ones . how long these boys in for ?

too hot , huh ? well , you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of mississippi ai n't interested in his meteorological assessments .

where am i at , man ?

my corn bread ? oh no , my friend . i love corn bread .

i seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up . them fellas sizzled up good . looked like some shit from the x- files . damn , that shit 's nasty .

hell of a way to get out . heard they burned up in that fire yesterday .

come on , old-timer , hook the brothers up .

of course nobody believed ray and claude .

old man wilkins ' never came out of that bathroom . died right there on the crapper .

ray 's special recipe . he always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned .

they gave me life , mama .

hey , where 's claude ? i do n't see claude !

respect ? well , is n't that progressive .

i believe in treating the convicts with respect , if that 's what you mean .

lemonade ?

appreciate it .

jenny ?

you should have come by last night , radio . you woulda had yourself some fun .

hey , ray , you ever been to the cotton club ?

couple years back , cookie made it clear to greenville .

that 's natchez-under-the-hill .

all i need is the front money and a truck . i could be back in two , three days tops if i had somebody to share the driving .

let her go .

adrian !

do n't do it !

all right . let me out .

why should it end ? who 's gon na stop us ?

yeah , get out of here ! beat it !

um , excuse me , we 're having a private conversation here .

i 've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years .

oh , nicky , i 've missed you . come on out and say hello ...

i would totally love to go there . but i hear it 's really hard to get in .

you know , we saw you save your girlfriend 's life .

i remember that night , you had like four daiquiris .

i got ta help her . i got ta help dad . i got ta help everybody .

valerie 's crying !

my brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat . which would explain my chronic halitosis .

this is baloney !

maybe you love her . but what do i know ? i 'm baked out of my mind .

come on , there 's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking .

you 'll be alright . go on . big day tomorrow . do n't forget to do that sleep thing i told you about .

can i take him with me and have sex with his head ?

in exchange for eternal damnation of your soul ? you 're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you , mr. marino .

how bad ?

hey .

i ca n't enjoy anything . i go fishing . i catch nothing . i go to orgies , i catch everything ...

you 're not saying it 's up to me ?

of course you do , tommy tune .

`` octopus people ? ''

i 'm sorry . i just assumed . your accent maybe . where are you from ?

that 's okay . i get messed with all the time and when i saw him doing that to you i just lost it . i hate when people take advantage of tourists . it ruins it for the rest of us .

why ? did she hurt you ? do you miss her ? need a shoulder to cry on ?

and sorry , man , but no dogs allowed .

yes . i would like my flask back .

i 'm a sandman !

do you think everything 's going to turn to ice ?

i hate outside ! i hate it !

he 's good , is n't he ?

yes , but they wo n't know that ... or care . they 're hunting you , logan . maybe me too , now ...

when did you begin to question lastday ?

i have .

maybe they 're angry because they 're grown in meccano-breeders .

why not ? maybe she 'll help me . you wo n't . you 'd better stay here .

i wish i could help you .

it 's different now . help me .

of course .

jessica .

yes ...

i like your face . would you mind if doc took a picture ? i 'd like him to give your face to somebody else .

oh ... i did so look forward to seeing all those people .

stay ? they lived together all their years ?

my father was the husband and my mother was the wife . `` beloved '' is a word they used -- to stay together .

thank you . tell me -- what do those words mean ? `` beloved husband '' ... `` beloved son '' ... `` beloved wife '' ...

thousands and thousands ... as many as my cats ?

all right .

it is n't fair . i 'll give you one of my favorite cats ... a jellicle cat . `` jellicle cats have cheerful faces , jellicle cats have bright black eyes ; they like to practice their airs and graces and wait for the jellicle moon to rise . ''

why not ?

no , one of us is always here to let the maid in . nobody else has a key .

no .

has anyone made any threats to either of you recently ?

alice , i ...

what if andy tips off mr. eddy ?

'cause that 's how long it 's gon na take , baby .

andy ?

we should stop seeing each other .

hello .

i do n't know .

but dick laurent is dead , is n't he ?

did you tell the police this ?

the night before you showed up in the slammer ...

i 've got men searching the building and the grounds now .

warden , it 's not him . it was not fred madison in that cell .

no ... i do n't feel so good . i would like some aspirin .

i did a routine once-over , and gave him a sleeping pill . i 've never seen this man before . neither have the guards . i do n't think he 's in the system .

i wo n't ever tailgate .

tone deaf .

let 's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom .

alice who ?

no ... of course not .

i thought there might be somebody inside .

i told you to stay in the car !

yes , i just found it on the step .

from the club . you did n't answer .

oh . oh , yeah . no . this is a different one .

good book , huh ?

i do n't know ... there 's no return address on the envelope ... in fact , there 's no address on it .

you do n't mind that i 'm not coming tonight ?

do they aim for the head or for the heart ?

did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces ?

that 's good , pete . hey ... i want you to talk to a friend of mine .

mr. eddy ?

you know who it is .

hey , pete ... how ya doin ' ?

her name is alice . you know i love that girl to death . if i ever found out somebody was makin ' out with her , i 'd take this ... ... and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth ... then you know what ? ...

how ya doin ' , pete ?

what ?

at your house . do n't you remember ?

go home , sheila .

hey ... sheila .

you 've been fucking somebody else have n't you ?

why do n't you like me ?

last time i saw you .

cable from gainsford .

why ? why 'come on ' all the time ? what 's the matter ? are you going to be a fuss budget all your life ? here , drink it up ! are n't you having any fun ? where was i ?

yeah . you know .

okay , lovey .

yes .

that 's too bad . i got a half million shares . my whole foundation ! and now look at me !

how about you lovey ? come on . let 's you and i play a game of honeymoon bridge .

some layout they got here . did you get a load of the rooms ? you could n't do better at the ritz .

i just feel as though i 'm being made ready for the executioner .

look at me . look at what they gave me to wear .

will you stop squawking !

mr. barnard , i do not like this place . i definitely do not like this place .

is it ?

good morning , lovey .

do n't call me brother .

oh - that ! that can wait . nobody 's going to run off with it . say , i 've got to get busy . i want to show this whole layout to chang . so long . do n't you take any wooden nickels .

not for me , thanks . no , i 'm too weary .

nothing . why ?

say , you 're an american , are n't you ?

right this very minute ! the porters are waiting for us on the plateau . and that chinaman thought he could stop me . come along .

there you are ! barnard , you 'd better get your things together . we 're leaving .

hey - look !

it 's weird . chang , how old are you ?

no thanks . not tonight if you do n't mind .

i mean , your amazement . i could have understood it in any of your companions , but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds . or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it ?

very often .

forgive me . i should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age . climate , diet , mountain water , you might say . but we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live . in your countries , on the other hand , how often do you hear the expression , `` he worried himself to death ? '' or , `` this thing or that killed him ? ''

yes , yes . they were very sincere about it too . you see , a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here . they 've never known anything different . so what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here .

that would suit me perfectly . i 'm always broke . how did you pay for them ?

but mr. chang , all these things - books , instruments , sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters ?

why , we have no crime here . what makes a criminal ? lack , usually . avariciousness , envy , the desire to possess something owned by another . there can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything .

shall we go inside ? i should so like to show you some of our rare treasures .

you know , that 's the fourth time you 've said that today . you should have a record made of it .

i 'm sure you were . when would you like to start ?

why , no .

oh , i 'm so glad .

you 've very kind mr. lovett .

i 'm afraid that would n't help . you see , we have no porters here .

you 've been lying to us ever since we got here ! apparently it 's worked with some people . perhaps it 's because they lack the courage to do anything about it . but not me , chang . you 're up against the wrong man . i 'll get out of here , if i have to blow this fantastic place into the valley ! i 'll get outporters or no porters !

a fine trick ! smart , are n't you ? what a pack of lies you told us about those porters ! of course the minute they arrive , we can make arrangements to leave . if they take us . but you knew very well you 'd tell them not to !

pardon me

you 're lying , are n't you ?

i 'll die if i have to stay here another minute ! i 've waited a long time for this chance to go , and you 're not going to stop me now . if i have to , i 'll go alone . it was i who bribed the porters . if it were n't for me , you 'd never get out !

it 's all your fault ! it was all arranged until he spoke to you ! why ca n't you leave us alone ?

that conway seemed to belong here . in fact , it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here .

what was that ?

all right . i 'll prove it to you ! you believe everything they 've told you - without proof ! i 'll prove my story !

she 's going with me .

what else can i think after a tale like that ? good heavens , bob , things like that do n't happen today . we 're living in the twentieth century .

did n't you find out anything about the porters ?

do n't you ever want to see what 's on the other side of the hill ?

do n't worry , george . nothing 's going to happen . i 'll fall right into line . i 'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be . i 'll be the best little foreign secretary we ever had , just because i have n't the nerve to be anything else .

just you wait until i 'm foreign secretary . ca n't you just see me , freshie , with all those other shrewd , little foreign secretaries ? you see , the trick is to see who can out-talk the other . everybody wants something for nothing , and if you ca n't get it with smooth talk , you send an army in . i 'm going to fool them , freshie . i 'm not going to have an army . i 'm going to disband mine . i 'm going to sink my battleships - i 'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft . then when the enemy approaches we 'll say , `` come in , gentlemen - what can we do for you ? '' so then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think . and what will they think , freshie ? they 'll think to themselves - `` something 's wrong here . we 've been duped . this is not according to form . these people seem to be quite friendly , and why should we shoot them ? '' then they 'll lay down their arms . you see how simple the whole thing is ? centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants and i 'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum .

hurray for us . did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated ? no , you would n't say that . they do n't count .

yes .

just what i needed too .

the next time you 're in wild country like this , keep in touch with the british consul .

come on ! quick ! this way .

bob , these are all that are left .

come on ! we 'll burn the hangar . that will make light for them !

well , mr. conway , for a man who is supposed to be a leader , your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing .

where are we going ? huh ?

you mean to tell me you 're not going to do anything until we land ?

i guess we 're in for it .

brilliant ! can anyone here fly a plane ?

why are n't you registered through our office ?

it 's the most annoying word in the english language . did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it ? mother 's little darling mus n't stick her fingers in the salad bowl . why ? because it is n't lady- like to do that . why ? because that 's what forks are made for , darling .

struggling , why ?

oh , the usual reasons . a world full of people struggling for existence .

ouch !

all of it . father perrault and his magnificent history . this place , hidden away from the rest of the world , with its glorious concepts , and now you come along and confuse me entirely .

i really only brought you here to show you my pigeons !

a man whose life was empty !

yes . hold this pigeon .

my name 's sondra .

how about you ? do you want to go ?

english !

you 'll tell me some of the things i want to know , wo n't you ? you 'll tell me who runs this place . and why we were kidnapped . and what they 're going to do with us !

i guess i lost :

yes . that 's true . actually , at this point , i just want a job . wait . what do you mean ... yet ?

sir , before you boot me , i just want to explain . i mean , okay , you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head ...

obvious ? why do n't you and i have a little talk about the obvious ... outside .

you shot an eight year old girl .

hesitated , sir .

sir . i thought those records were sealed .

you do ?

then where did it -- ? sir . forgive me , but it makes no sense . worked my ass off to grad --

mikey . hold it , mikey -- i want you to talk to me . mikey . i 'm telling you.. do n't make me ... mikey gim me the 140 .

three , huh ? really ? cause a cup of coffee says we 're talking about ... number ... four ? huh ? no ?

why ? what are you gon na do ?

this is a neurelyser . it was a gift from some friends from out of town . i need you to look at it . this red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain . more specifically , the ones -for memory , which it will then block . i said i need you to look right here .

do n't `` sir '' me -- you have no idea who you 're dealing with .

pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui ! take the van and go .

ins , washington . special services .

i have n't been training a partner -- i 've been training a replacement .

do it ! shoot him !

actually , it is a shotgun . hold onto it --

maybe they did n't get here . maybe they 've been here .

we 're rising .

that 's the loch ness monster . and ... kay -- that 's ... 444-eyes ?

what 's going on , kay ?

hold it .

then would n't we also know if he 's here ?

a signazoid 's eleven thousand pounds . i think we 'd know if held left .

you do n't know me at all .

well , first of all ... i got ta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a ferrari testerrosa . i mean , there is a lot of ` em on the street these days , and ... uh ...

so what 's the problem ?

kay . seriously . what if he actually means what he says ?

yeah . his dream and our worst nightmare .

or what 's no horrible down here that everyone 's trying to avoid it ?

out of focus ?

what do we do ?

it would 've had to have been recently -- within a few weeks .

well , first of all , it 's entomologist .

it 's hard to find . it 's an old civil war cemetery . nobody ever goes there . so ... what is it you say you do ?

do have any idea what i just said ?

i 'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt .

and i 'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me --

and i 'm arranging deportation papers .

not bad . briliiant , actually . you come unarmed , and alone . cause your army 's been growing underground for what ? 100 years ? 150 ?

how could it not ?

yeah , i 'll talk to you .

found it .

they 're not even gon na be your enemie-a if you do n't give that to me really soon .

wait -- listen --

i got a planet check on that bug . it 's from way the hell out in the third belt . it 's organic , formed in the same blast that made our solar system .

and i assume you 're bringing this to us because we 're the most powerful country on the planet ...

run !

she 's still alive ?

she died ?

ca n't you see ? she just wanted her little girl back .

i am going back . i see myself there .

please --

he 'll turn around .

what ?

take it .

is it now ?

i 'm sorry , but i need your help . you contain information . i need to know how to get it . can you just tell me who leo crow is ? can you tell me if --

i 'm setting up a timer . when it goes off tomorrow , take off your bandages and get the hell out of here . but not before then , or you 'll --

and put them out . some not as quickly as others , but let 's change the subject , shall we ? the future is much more interesting than the past . do n't you think ?

why ?

no ... we have the two previsions from the twins right here , but ... ... i ca n't pull up any data from the female . probably just a glitch .

huh , we do n't seem to have her data .

i just wanted to congratulate you . you did it . you 've created a world without murder . so what if you had to kill someone to do it .

john . just tell me , who 's leo crow ?

we 're years from that . john , i 'm asking you : please , come in , we 'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out .

we wo n't let them .

what if danny witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run ?

i understand . what 's the other thing ?

do n't apologize , john .

do n't run , chief . you know we 'll catch you . you trained us .

i show a cop on horseback .

get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside .

uh , sir ...

still scrubbing ... looks like there 's a third party , somebody wearing shades just out the window ...

the victim 's name is leo crow .

now look at him ...

no maglev system .

we ca n't grab it ...

just a nickname .

really ? you 've never been inside ?

speaking of interfacing , i 'd love to say hello .

the fact that you prevented it from happening does n't change the fact that it was going to happen .

because it was going to fall .

uh , i 'll try ...

rufus , play it back ...

stop --

i 'm your son . i 'm you .

i wanted to .

oh , sean --

do you know who i am ?

sometimes in order to see the light , you have to risk the dark .

i used to joke with lamar that we were the mother and father of precrime . well , in my experience , parents often see their children as they want them to be , not as they are .

not if i stay away from him .

oh , god , what did you do ?

no . i do n't think you do . the other day , when he came to the cottage , he talked about a lot of things , but danny witwer , the man he was supposed to have just killed ? he did n't mention him . he did n't say his name even once .

i thought you were retiring ?

it 's insanity around here .

yes ... it 's called an echo . the act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the precogs .

this murder is happening at two different times .

he told me about this . you got this from containment ?

lamar , i found something .

near death 's real popular right now , which includes everything from getting hit by a car , to falling off a high building to plane crashes . it 's a big rush , you come out the other side without a heart attack .

if you were a child killer , you took these pictures , would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find ?

sure . raincheck .

i 'd love to , but i 've got an open house today at the ressler place .

no , but then i do n't talk to john that much anymore .

i do n't have any cream . sorry .

nice to meet you , wally .

no thank you .

do n't worry about me getting in . just tell me where it is .

phone , room service , mini-bar . any additional expense . if you need anything you can push the button marked 'concierge ' , and they 'll be able to help you .

what 's 'incidentals ? '

we used to take baths together .

i know .

i do n't know . do whatever you want .

he 's okay .

i got news for you , bobby , he do n't give a shit .

what time is it there ?

chloe ?

take her .

fine . you want to help ricky , talk to maxie yourself .

they 're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face .

i 'm ready .

they requested her . it was her gig . max put me on as a favor .

i do n't get it .

dude , listen , man . i 'm cool . how much for the treatment ?

look , man , i 'm the bachelor , alright ? i gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --

whu --

nah , man . no one is . they got some puerto ricans and a new crop of fuckin irish immigrants .

ruiz tied in out there ?

where is this happening ?

shit .

to be honest , man , i do n't know shit either . all i know is it ai n't drugs and it ai n't now .

he making the drop ?

yeah . where is he ?

ricky ? ricky ' i lost the truck ' ricky ?

not driving jess , you wo n't .

bobby , i love jessica like she 's my own daughter . i would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter , but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in beverly hills and wants i should buy him an implant . your silverback horseshit 's gon na cost me eight grand .

me ? no . not really .

i did n't tell him shit . he worries too much . i love that old jew , but he 's gon na kill himself worrying . we started this shit , and we 're gon na finish it .

jesus christ , where the fuck you been all night ? you look like you got shit out in the gorilla house .

what 's that ?

thanks a lot . do n't worry about it .

you 're not getting a gun .

let 's just go now and wait .

eighty .

all the more reason .

i listened extremely carefully . nothing was even vaguely implied . he even laughed in your face when you asked him

he said it 's being arranged . he said jimmy will know .

i swear to god , i did n't do anything .

fuck you . go then . i 'm taking the car .

yeah . what vibe ?

no . they asked who i was , then told me what corner .

nothing .

it 's on west broadway . we can walk .

we 're here representing max . you 're acting like a puerto rican on the fifteenth of the month .

what are you doing ?

forty-six .

who you calling ?

we 're not supposed to get drunk . we 're on call .

see , man . maxie fuckin takes care of you when you 're in . beats cleaning carpets .

this paint sucks . the white shows through .

oh , give me a break . look at her . she do n't even know where the hell she is . she 'd have more fun at bordner 's .

please . i got three inches on you . you would n't have landed a punch if i did n't let you .

do n't be shitty .

so ?

show me . show me where it says screech on the fucking list .

again with the fucking china club ! what do i look like a fucking persian to you ?

cardiff giant . just check .

you see a ricky slade ?

yes .

yes ?

dude , you just got ta settle your shit down . you got ta go and say all that 'red dragon ' shit . make him think he 's on barretta .

i ... i just hired these guys to watch my back ...

i ca n't yet vouch for the amount , unless you want me to sit here and count .

that 's alright , man . it 's a little early for me to drink .

what do you want ?

no shit ?

you think it 's funny , motherfucker ?

ricky .

yes , sir .

you want ... why are you picking on me ?

yes . you 're going to new york .

that 's none of your fucking business .

so , we 're talking money laundering ...

take it easy . lay down and do n't think about it .

take it easy , baby .

and every cat 's watching , ai n't they ? it 's a toe-down .

i do n't want your money .

it 's me or you , ai n't it , pops ?

1 , 2 , 8 hit , did n't it ?

how 's it feel ?

is your papa west indian ?

the dirty yellow rat bastard .

the body is a holy repository .

allah has sent us a prophet , a black man named elijah muhammad . for if god is black , malcolm --

little .

start at the beginning . page one , the first one . here --

okay , okay .

i respect myself . a man cuss because he has n't got the words to say what 's on his mind .

let it burn . maybe you 'll hear me then .

you ai n't lying .

what did you give it to me for then ?

man , get outa my face . i ai n't nobody 's punk .

we need more young warriors like yourself , stick around and we shall see if your heart is true .

i admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly .

i just put them to bed . can we come to the meeting tomorrow ?

at the hilton . the girls asleep ?

the simplest thing in the world : i want to have a lot of babies with you . dear heart , i love you .

and dogged when i set my mind to something .

are you ?

oh ? purely scientific interest i 'm sure .

what ?

but we do know that the people of that region of asia minor , from the tigris-euphrates valley to the mediterranean , are dark-skinned people . i 've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels . i have never seen a native of that area who was not black .

then we do n't know that god was white .

that 's right .

you 've been talking about the disciples . what color were they ?

do you know what a friend you have in jesus , son ?

if you want to tell me .

'bout every other night , red .

save it , baby . save it for mr. right , 'cause your grandma 's smarter than ya think .

i ai n't stupid .

you 'll regret this , mrs. little .

let me die then .

lem me feed you , sweetie , while they hot .

what 's your story , baby ?

shhhh ! i do n't like women that talk .

do n't never try to cross someone who ai n't afraid to die .

head nigger in charge ?

good grades . fine athlete . president of his class .

he 's bright .

no .

how do i contact you ? we still do n't have the atm info .

he lives in a judicial compound . he travels by motorcade . he has better protection than george bush . even more importantly he is part of la hermanidad . his reach is far and wide .

[ so you 're married to him ? and this looks remarkably like his brother . ]

[ head of the anti-kidnapping division . ]

[ the ransom money . at the drop . he said tazinari , one of the policemen had taken it . he was crazy . ]

[ four-seven-four-seven . ]

[ romans , chapter 12 , verse 21 . ]

who 's he ?

[ i am the president of la hermanidad . ]

[ i want you . ]

[ please , do n't ... ]

i 'll probably kill them . is that likely ?

and what if amateurs try it ?

i 'll take the .45 and the webley .32 .

i wo n't kill again . hunt people . i gave that up . anything else ? it 's yours .

two days gone . they 're negotiating a ransom .

i mean nothing . the hammer came down and nothing happened . dimple on the primer .

a bodyguard ... who 's the guy ?

bullshit . i 've known you fifteen years . you do n't visit .

and what if , just say , there was a kidnap attempt ?

not for eight months . i was in columbia looking around , but , nothing seemed interesting .

everything happens once if you live long enough .

i could do it . remember the day you wanted the pencil ? i know why . and i saw that car again . i wrote the license number in my notebook . except i missed the last number .

frank . frankie .

my mom drinks , too ... why do people drink , creasy ?

it 's no wonder you 're late . why did n't she just come with you ?

good things happen , too , creasy . like meeting me .

remember you asked me what state i was from ?

does n't matter . i always finish second .

in a week you should be fine .

yes . actually , he was driving me crazy .

being unhappy is a state of mind . i never thought about it .

it was n't a school like yours and there was no sister anna .

not at all ?

that 's right .

time will tell .

then do n't come .

it is serious , mrs. ramos .

for an american she understands this country very well .

she 's young . she 'll get over it .

he has to go .

you realize that you 've brought a killer into the house .

our child 's safety is at stake .

[ is that good or bad ? ]

i told you she was n't especially attractive , but that she had a good deal of charm , and she 's really a real nice girl ...

brush her . listen , you wan na come with me tonight , or you wan na go with this dog ?

oh , i could n't eat nothing . my mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws .

all right , i 'll see you !

i 'm gon na take clara home . it 's close to one .

down there . that little one there .

what makes you say that ?

angie . he says she was a real scrawny- looking thing .

they 're the worst . college girls are one step from the streets . they smoke like men inna saloon . my son joseph , his wife , you know , she types onna typewriter . one step from the streets , i tell you . mrs. pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment .

that 's my son thomas 's baby .

okay .

all right .

waddaya doing tomorrow night ?

no ...

oh , you wo n't be so lonely . you 'll make friends right away .

i 'm afraid of being lonely .

i think you 're kidding yourself , clara . i used to think about moving out , you know ? and that 's what i used to say . `` my mother needs me . '' but when you really get down to it , that ai n't it at all . actually , you need your father . you know what i mean ? you 're living at home , and you got your father and mother there , and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life .

i think anything you want to do , you 'll do well .

thank you .

you got ta real nice face , you know ? it 's really a nice face .

i 'm twenty-nine years old . how old are you ?

sure .

well , i do n't know the people , of course , but as a rule , i do n't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple .

you do n't think my sister catherine should live in her daughter-in-law 's house ?

i 'll take you over , and i 'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine , and then i 'll cut out . because i got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck , and i 'll pay you five bucks .

what girl , what does she know ? why do n't you let her hold the baby once in a while ? ! your mother , boy , she wantsa take the kid for a day , that 's fine !

marty , see that my mother is nice and comfortable , eh ?

tommy , gim me a coupla minutes , because i promised mr. gazzara i 'd let him know tomorrow . see , what i wan na know , tom , if a buncha individual retail merchants get together , how does it operate ? on individual mark- ups ? you know what i mean ? say i 'm the butcher and aldo capelli , he 's the dairyman and grocer , so suppose i mark up thirty-five percent , but he works on forty , so ...

do n't worry about it .

tommy , before you go , i wonder if you gim me a little advice .

do n't bring her to the house no more .

sure .

how 'd you come home , ma ? thomas give you a ride ?

oh , we got plenny-a room here .

hello , ma .

i 'm coming home right now , ma . i 'll be home in about two minutes . tell thomas stick around , i wan na see him about something .

hello , marty , when you coming home ? where you now ? because your cousin thomas and his wife virginia , they 're here . they had another fight with your aunt catherine ... i do n't know ...

i ca n't do that , ralph , because somebody already brushed her off once tonight .

what nurses ?

right .

sure .

well , i do n't know what you want me to do , virginia . if you want me , i 'll go talk to her tonight .

she was here , you know , wednesday , and i said , `` catherine , my sister ... ''

so what happened , aunt theresa , about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law , she comes inna kitchen , aunt theresa , and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there , so then she begins telling me how i waste money and how i ca n't cook , and how i 'm raising my baby all wrong , so she got me so nervous , i spilled some milk i was making for the baby ...

waddaya talking about ? ! !

tommy !

okay .

what do you want me to do ?

i do n't care about the intention . i just know your cross action is a plus on our side . i 've seen it come through four times .

it certainly is n't henry 's fault hot lips houlihan does n't like her name .

there 's only one way .

she had this shiny black hair piled up on her head , but later on she let it hang loose and i 'll be damned if it did n't come all the way down to her ass .

epidural hematoma ?

you must open me up again ?

that 's okay . live a little , learn a little .

us . lead us not into ...

the door , frank , the door ! where you from anyhow , alaska ?

and get ourselves another touchdown to win . i wish to hell we knew what they were plotting .

we got to stop them right here .

when he sees a little running room , he likes to make a show ... you know , stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz . also he never learned to button up when he gets hit , so if you two can get a good shot at him once , you can hurt him .

screw it . we been earning our keep as respectable knife artists . why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle ?

but no short-arm inspection . i 'm with you there .

there 's no transportation anyway this time of night .

where the hell we going to get us a football team ?

we been had .

now that 's what i call real pretty . we can close up here and go into his belly .

and gets the wind every time it opens . no , thanks . i 'll take that one .

pretty near . what do you know about the outfit we 're going to ?

you got directions ?

wait a second ...

come clean with us , frank . were you on this religious kick back home , or did you start to crack up here on the post ?

the hell we wo n't ! you bastards pulled something , i do n't know what , but we 've been beating you without him . ane we 'll go on beating you !

neither does henry blake . but i 'll tell you what makes him the best c.o . you 've got in any of your hospitals . he leaves all the medical decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what meatball surgery is .

i 'm impressed , pierce . naturally , the kind of job i have , i do n't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the or .

now , general , i 'm going to sandbag you . do you think we 're ready to get out of this belly ?

what ?

i though you said we did n't have a drop .

so what makes you think he 'll play for us ?

on account he got caught in the doctor draft . he was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the eagles signed him .

be kind of rough on him if there 's no blood . why do n't we close up and sit on him a couple of days ?

oh , jesus .

dartmouth 's too big and too expensive . if he 's as good as i think he is , he can move into the big league later . but androscoggin first .

and if it is n't , why do n't we call washington on your telephone ? you tell your story , we 'll tell ours .

oh , you want to play it straight ? i guess i owe you an apology .

ho-jon , give the father some more martini .

no , thank you . i 'm not the slightest bit interested .

i 've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'hawkeye . '

major burns is far from satisfied .

we may be in trouble , i ca n't catch my breath . i 've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes .

how would he avoid it ... as if i needed to ask ?

you 're leaving tomorrow ?

it 's terribly hard . sometimes the temptation is just too much .

very happily married .

something else we have in common .

you have a certain modest charm yourself .

you 're getting a workout , you and captain forrest , your first night .

there 's nothing ridiculous about it . a kid like you ...

yes , reverend ?

let 's get his clothes off quick .

there 's only one worth noticing .

right , ho-jon . see you later .

there 's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another .

that 's all the commitment you 're offering me ? or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation ?

splendid , sir . no problems .

morning , radar . how were things ?

we 've got too many wounded for us to handle now ! get on the phone right away and ...

what 's that , henry ?

if i can make a suggestion , coach .

now ?

can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me ?

i been out of action since i got over here five months ago .

ease off on those tapes , and let 's see how much it bleeds . how is he ?

nice .

did you get it , too ?

john , please let me go with you ! please , john !

go ahead , driver ! ball park !

i guess so . then what happened ?

you know , i had a crazy dream last night . it was about you .

uh-huh . . .

hello , john .

no .

grab it , eddie , grab it !

um-hum .

yes . the john doe party .

yes , sir .

and , miss mitchelli think from now on you 'd better work directly with me .

a hundred dollars !

you bet i will , ma .

darling , there are so many complaining political speeches . people are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio . if you 're going to have him say anything , why do n't you let him say something simple and real , something with hope in it ? if your father were alive , he 'd know what to say .

well , yes , i know , dear , but these people are in such need and we have plenty now .

you remember those lovely people your father used to take care of ? i thought i 'd buy them some groceries . oh , ann , dear , it 's a shame , those poor

thank you .

listen . if that guy lays an egg . i want to get something out of it . i 'm getting a jane doe ready !

no , no , no . now that 's too much !

sure , it 's a meal ticket for me . i admit it , but it 's also a windfall for somebody like mr. norton who 's trying to crash national politics . that 's what you bought the newspaper for , is n't it ? you wanta reach a lotta people , do n't you ? well , put john doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em . he can say anything he wants and they 'll listen to him .

if you do , mr. norton , you 're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is ! excuse me .

i got it all ready . here .

right here . sit down .

anybody ! er , erbeany 'll do !

what john doe ?

uh-huh . you said you wanted fireworks .

yeh , d. b. oh , just cleaning out the dead-wood . okay .

no sense in going up there ! i been here for hours . he ai n't here !

no .

uh-huh . till my wing [ 4 ] went bad .

go on , go on , go on . and we 'll be at jim 's bar up the street .

yes , both of 'em ! but do n't let him out of your sight .

listen , sucker , yuh ever been broke ?

and let me tell you , long john . when you become a guy with a bank account , they got you . yes sir , they got you !

just like you said on the radio , mr. doe .

grubbel 's here . see ?

this is sourpuss . er , excuse me . er , mr. smithers , mr. doe .

john doe club ?

hey , stop worrying , colonel . fifty bucks ai n't going to ruin me .

and you 'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it , would n't you ?

listen , palthis fifth column stuff 's pretty rotten , is n't it ? [ 11 ]

well ?

look , d. b. i 'm supposed to know my way around . this john doe movement costs you a fortune . this convention 's gon na cost plenty .

well , the paper said there were some jobs around loose . thought there might be one left over .

did you write that letter to miss mitchell ?

what difference does that make ?

now , hold on a minute , young man ! hold on ! that 's rather big talk ! i started the john doe clubs with my money and i 'll decide whether or not they 're being properly used !

yeah . i , uh , well . . . no . it 'll wait . say , he 's a nice man , is n't he ? mr. norton , i mean . he 's , er , he 's done an awful lot for the

and another thing , what about all the kids in the country , the kids that idolize ball players ? what are they gon na think about you ? close shot : of the colonel . he has dropped his gloveflopped into a chairand has taken out his ocarina .

yep . there was a major league scout there watching me , too . and he came down after the game with a contract . do you know what ? i could n't life my arm to sign it . but i 'll be okay again as soon as i get it fixed up .

yeah , okay .

mind if we make a stop on the way ? we busted frank antonucci on possession . he gave us a lead on that polk street jewelry heist .

no -- you ca n't do that .

hello , guys .

used record shop down on turk street . i was in there looking for some robert johnson . memories ... memory lane or something ...

may i come in ? i would just like to ask you a couple of questions .

fuck you ! you know what he did to me ? ! ...

man , what 's this about ? ya know , you were robbing a store . it was n't personal . it was his job .

tell him what , what do you want me to tell him ?

tell my dad .

they have less power over you if you look into my eyes .

it 's not just the particles man , it 's the whole fucking machine , this is how they get assassins to operate . it 's been this way since the cuban missile crisis .

hold on a second here .

did you check out dmv for any vehicles registration ?

earl .

for now that 's all .

are you in charge , roper ?

good . i wo n't be armed . we got ta operate on trust here . we 're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible .

alright , roper . you want to come ... come .

that 's a chance i got ta take .

bullshit ! would it have happened to you ?

how much you wan na bet ?

i 'm just practicing my lying .

what did you see ?

tell me what you need .

where did you hear that ?

she 's back in jersey ... going to graduate school .

you living together ?

like it had to be done .

sorry ... habit .

i ca n't leave , ray . it 's part of my negotiator 's oath . once i 'm in the room with the hostage , i have to stay .

i 'm talking about ... what are you talking about ?

a deeper level ?

you 've changed you know . i do n't think there 's anything you ca n't do once you put your mind to it .

yeah .

hmm ?

yeah , i could get used to this paradise shit .

i 've been craving that stuff all week .

no . the kind from kraft , with the macaroni and the cheese .

something i guess i ca n't have anymore .

about 4 months old . i 'm working in a new style .

ronnie , forget this what's-his-name .

here comes the wire ... and ... backtrack gets up in the last jump . cozy girl a very game second .

we 've only seen and talked to one suspect . he calls himself `` joe '' . there 's two jewelers , two salespeople , the manager , a security guard , and an elderly woman . this particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair . they have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day , so they sure as shit did n't just wander in . they knew what they were coming for .

any verification on numbers .

what do we got ?

roper ...

i want to be put on this case .

and even if this does n't work , i want all the money . these swat guys do n't have the temperament . they do n't have the background ...

i 'll provide you with transportation .

are you going to make this hard for me ?

what ?

-- two million people lost in the digital night . what do they seek ?

it 's time to wake up .

and all dreams , no matter how appealing , must eventually end .

you were the one who was dying .

halden sent men to kill me in my sleep , but simple illusions won out . so he now sends the legend to finish the deed .

the patterns were moved around , but they were n't changed .

it 's his nature .

where the hell are you going ?

then where is she ?

why would i do that ?

what is it ?

you 're jumping to conclusions .

we can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system .

wo n't be time if he gets access --

he had keys .

and it meant something .

but i do n't know anything about programming .

you went to my high-school ?

-- katie .

try me .

access granted . male or female ?

destination ?

voice activate .

we 've got him locked !

we 've come all this way for a rock wall ? !

activating power beam !

... let 's take a look over there .

in a place that came to be known as angel grove .

about twenty seconds in your time .

it is said that to those who possess the power ... all things are possible .

you okay ?

we have to get out of here ! !

tommy , you are the falcon , winged lord of the sky .

it 's ... an eagle ?

couldn '' t stand them -- low-class all the way . and did you catch a whiff of their breath ? ! it 's like having a conversation with a couple of onions ! not to mention ...

mordant , go with them and report back to me !

mm hmm .

i love you , mom . i have to run . you remembered to call the limousine service , right ?

oh , it was such a big scandal .

who is it ?

i see . how much ?

nah , not dangerous . not that dangerous . not during the day .

but you did *talk* to mr. allen about that and -- ?

i did not --

it was done to stop me from talking about a section of the appropriations bill !

the war 's on !

take me home , diz .

susan ? nah !

nothing like -- uh -- susan -- or anything like that , huh ?

well , let 's get going .

i apologize .

mind , now ! keep don quixote out of here !

shut up , diz .

-- followin ' miss susan fass-pass around -- his little heart poundin ' away -- the sound of angels ' wings in his ears .

well , well -- yeah -- i got smart and thought i 'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting . i said , `` mr. president , about the monopoly investigation -- '' and he jumps right in and says , `` diz , if you were sitting in my chair , would you answer the question you 're about to ask ? '' he had me .

did you like the first act ?

ah . one of the supporting characters .

i 'm still asking myself -- what is he -- animal , vegetable , or mineral ? a senator ! a united states senator ! i thought i 'd seen everything but -- why , he does n't know what time it is , diz ! when i think of myself sitting around -- playing straight for all that phoney , patriotic chatter -- *me* , carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists -- no , i ca n't take it , diz -- i 'm through -- i quit !

you know -- mrs. diz moore .

that old standing offer from diz moore -- poet of washington correspondents .

well , because you 're doing all right at the minute .

no , not yet , senator paine -- not hide nor hair of the man . you mean to say the boys have n't -- ?

hey -- you 're into me for a buck already . i say -- mcgann . shoot the whole dollar .

how do you *like* this ! you do n't suppose that ranger met up with some kids -- and took 'em for a hike !

for instance , how to run the affairs of government ? no doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me -- with the greatest ease !

now , pet -- jim !

save that for the laying of cornerstones , hubert ! oh , that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman !

this is n't a home , it 's the crossroads of the world !

what is it ?

yup -- sweeney , flood , farrell -- waiting for you --

all set . foley 's rooms in the senate office building -- nice , big clean desk -- lot of senator stationery to write his little boys on -- and foley 's secretary , saunders , to make it look like the real thing --

oh -- oh .

jim -- if i fling a party man like horace in the face of those angry committees --

well , jeff put that out himself .

maybe you 'd like to come along and watch , governor ? jefferson 's done a wonderful job with that leg .

you have ? will you come in a minute , miss saunders .

boy ! my head 's like a balloon -- for two whole days . i never knew there was so much american history .

for one week !

i say it 's *your* parade , sir ! you 've *got* to come !

the gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his state . he has been waiting , as he so fancifully puts it , for them to come marching here in droves . would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say ?

will the senator --

will he *yield* ?

jeff ! you 're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up -- the reasons -- the benefits --

goodnight , miss paine .

nonsense , jeff .

what 's to stop you ? saunders will help you with it --

well , why not do it ? there 's a job for you . get a bill started to accomplish it -- present it to congress -- it would be a great experience --

jeff , look -- did n't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a national boys ' camp ? were you in earnest about that ?

his last fight was his best , jeff . he and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim . you know , they tried everything , bribery , intimidation , then -- well --

fine --

jerry ! blackie ! queenie ! let 's have it quiet , fellows !

i mean it . i -- without you , i could't 've --

oh -- *saunders* !

no !

i know . it 's -- violet .

you -- you 've *got* a first name , have n't you ?

i never met anyone more -- more intelligent -- or capable . i -- i do n't know where i 'd be on this bill of mine without your help --

well -- gosh -- that -- that is n't `` particulars , '' is it ?

do you really think we 're getting anywhere .

the steering committee .

good . where are we ?

you get to your feet in the senate and present it . then you take the bill and put it in a little box -- like a letter box -- on the side of the rostrum . just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in . clerks read it and refer it to the right committee --

i would n't know in the *day time* .

whose statue is that ?

the dome -- the capitol dome --

what is it ?

whoa ! hold it ! pipe down ! come on , now -- that 's enough of that .

well ! you do n't say !

uh -- mr. president -- you and i are about to be alone in here , sir . i 'm not complaining for social reasons , but it 'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this . mr. president -- i call the chair 's attention to rule five of the standing rules of the senate section three . `` if it shall be found that a quorum is not present , a majority of the senators present -- , '' and that begins to look like me -- '' may direct the sergeant-at-arms to request , and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent senators . '' mr. president -- *i so direct* .

well -- i have got *one* idea --

what does he want to -- ? what 's *he* doing writing a bill ?

that wo n't work , chick . this boy 's honest , not stupid .

i know that .

joe -- i 'm getting leery of this guy . we keep calling him dumb -- and he keeps winding up in our hair ! i 'm telling you -- when he finds out there 's a dam going up where he wants his camp , he 's gon na start asking questions six ways from sunday --

that 's dynamite , joe !

what do i *mean* , huh ? uh -- *i'll* tell ya -- world 's series -- a pass ! in a month it 's worth fifteen bucks !

every word that boy said is the truth ! i 'm not fit for office ! i 'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land ! expel me -- !

i thought i could , too . *my* business -- this fine future ! i have no future i *care* about , if this boy is broken ! i -- i ca n't sleep . the only important thing in my life now is to save what i can for him . i want him to get a start again -- i 'll see that he 's taken care of as long as he lives -- ! saunders -- whether you ever mean anything to him or not --

what are you driving at ? you want *me* to get him to sign that ?

i see . all right . you finish this job properly -- and you get a handsome bonus besides --

what do you mean ?

the ranger 's notices ? no idea at all .

he wo n't get started ! i 'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours . i 've done it all my life ! i 'll blacken this punk until -- joe -- your job is back in the senate -- keep those men fighting him *there* .

and if he can raise public opinion against us -- if any *part* of this sticks --

but -- if he *does* , joe --

anything *better* to offer ?

it 's in your lap , joe . keep an eye on him . if he gets to his feet and says anything --

well , then appoint miller -- if you 're sure he 'll take orders .

-- in other words , jim -- with this willet creek dam on the fire -- the man who goes to the senate now in sam foley 's place ca n't ask any questions or talk out of turn . we must be absolutely sure of him .

here , here , susan -- this is jeff smith -- our new senator .

i accuse this man -- by his tone -- by his careful denials -- he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct -- ! *i'll* tell you why we were in tht room . because mr. taylor , a respected citizen of our state , had brought with him the evidence against this man , later presented from this floor , and *we were urging him to resign* -- !

will senator smith yield to -- ?

we 'd like to get in touch with him . it 's very important .

yes , i

i say , my friend , do you know a fellow by the name of longfellow deeds ?

morning , neighbors . morning .

for no reason , i guess . he always does it . we always run into the house when we see him coming .

no , no children .

your honor , this is absurd . the woman 's obviously in love with him .

yes !

mary - i - excuse me

gosh , she looks better every time i see her .

sure !

i 'm from a small town too , you know .

what did you mean by that ?

oh , that

you 're worried about those articles they 're writing about you , are n't you ?

i say , to most people it 's a washout .

it 's wonderful .

have you seen the papers ?

do you always wear your hair like that ?

i enjoy it .

oh , i do n't mind .

feel better now ?

oh , did i ? i 'm sorry . . .

you started out to be a successful newspaper woman , did n't you ?

you have n't gotten very far , have you ? that 's where you were an hour ago . come on , let 's knock off and go down to joe 's . the gang 's waiting for us .

oh , as bad as that , huh ?

when 're you going to see him again ?

listen , babe - get me some stuff on this guy , and you can have

yes .

me , sir ?

who ? miss dawson ?

will you show mr. hallor to the front door ?

it 's a lie !

what was that you said he was ?

he 's what ?

you ca n't ?

make three reservations on the first train out to mandrake falls , vermont .

why not ? who is he ?

are you a married man , mr. deeds ?

buffer ?

oh , yes , i heard you all right . $ 20,000,000 . that 's quite a lot , is n't it ?

is mr. deeds in ?

oh , will you come in please , gentlemen ?

what about your knocking off for lunch ?

shut up !

just as i suspected , wise guy ! i do n't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me , too .

no , you do n't ! get this clear : socking people is no solution for anything .

i do n't remember . `` cinderella man ! '' what do they mean by that ?

what do you think bodyguards are for ?

name your poison and i 'll supply it .

entertainment ?

uh-huh .

he was the last baby my father delivered , arthur was .

oh , sure . sure . we do n't want to fire arthur .

oh , i do n't mean that . i 'm sure i 'm going to need your help .

i 'm chairman ?

ja .

here 's the order for the plows . we got a good price on them .

now wait a minute , buddy

what kind of wife did you say she was ?

mr. deeds , do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home ?

take the stand !

hear what he said ? you know how much twenty million is ?

i 'm kind of nervous . i 've never been away from mandrake falls in my life . kind of like to see grant 's tomb , though .

now you keep out of this !

nice day out - er , nice night - was n't it ? - is n't it ?

what , sir ?

who ?

twenty ! what did he do with them ?

tell me , walter , are all those stories i hear about my uncle true ?

every man to his taste , sir .

no , sir .

yes . jeremy will be home for the weekend . and you can meet the kids .

they said if i did n't get help , they would n't deal with me any more . what do you think about that ?

her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner . first time in a long time she 's been willing .

hello , mr. cook . i was wondering if sofie was around ?

ernest , what do you think ?

what an asshole !

what kind of doubts ?

how do you mean ?

i think i 've heard of him ... a disciple of rothberg , was n't he ?

right now ?

what are you doing for lunch ?

-- which i do n't necessarily agree .

what ? !

i never said that .

it does n't matter how i feel about it . it 's how you feel about it that matters .

you find it distasteful , do n't you ?

mr. follett .

i did n't see you there . can i help you ?

no ... i mean about althea . about her ... ... behavior . do you think you can fix her up ?

... people who have come to you with the faith that you know what you 're doing ... and that you are who you say you are ?

okay .

i do n't want you to be mad at skip ...

it 's a pleasure to meet you .

... and ?

doc . ainge ...

you know who that is , do n't you ? you really do n't ? that 's skip skipperton , man . he gets himself hit by a truck , this whole town shuts down .

... but it 's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it 's the school from the next district --

i just got my license two weeks ago .

got a license ? but no car ?

sofie . it 's so obvious ... you 're after my daughter .

good evening , mrs. cook .

oh ... not a real doctor .

i love you . more than i 've ever loved anyone or anything in my life .

what do you think i 'm after , mrs. cook ?

i 'm saying that since i 'm doing so much better -- which i attribute to you -- i 'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings .

i 'm glad .

is it something you 've heard about me ?

and he 's where ?

it does n't matter . go on .

you actually address yourself by name in your thoughts ? so you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage ?

there ... i 've given myself a real whopper .

so the headaches may not even be a part of this ?

sore throat ?

something 's bothering her .

can i ask you something ? did n't you tell my dad you did n't think it was a good idea to come to the patient ? so what changed ?

i do n't think i can afford it . i do n't want my dad paying .

that 's okay . maybe it is . my mother always says -- `` everything that 's wrong with you is in your head . '' i suppose that 's true .

what ?

feel free to lie down . most people do .

uh-huh .

what are you doing ? we 're not done . i just need to find the thing ...

it 's a really weird thing for a shrink to say ... and then you said maybe people 'd be happier if they 'd accept that some things do n't change -- that it 'd be some kind of a relief or something ...

pro boner ? pro bono , huh ? for whose good , supposedly ?

the school board does n't pay you ? what kind of deal is that ?

why do you think you tell me , nessa ?

in maybe three or four issues .

i guess that makes sense .

lily ... ... skip , that 's great ! you and lily .

everything flows from that , and what does n't ... can be easily purchased .

did you carry a gun ?

i can tell you anything else .

definitely .

slash what ?

it 's true , believe me . so ... do you know what i 've been doing , all alone , in my workshop , for almost two years ? ... mr. find-the-need-and-fill- it . how i spend my every solitary hour ?

-- skip . knowing what you do about me --

yep .

this is exactly what i wanted .

i 'm impressed . i could n't make three million dollars if i lived three lifetimes .

of course ! that 's exactly what i want .

can i ask you a personal question ?

it 's possible . i do n't know about that .

when ?

relax , i got him .

what are you looking for ? lie , and i 'll slit your throat .

it is better to be the right hand of the devil , ... than in his path . as long as i serve him , i am immune .

then you got no excuse for living . what the hell you doin , being buddies with this creep , beni ? what 's in it for you ?

just looking for you , o'connell ! i wanted to be with my friend !

altar boys ?

i got caught robbing a synagogue . lots of good stuff in them holy places ; churches , temples , mosques , and who 's guarding them ?

the key ! ? she has the lost key ! ?

i would n't trade ya for a brass spittoon !

for them to protect it like this , you just know there 's got to be treasure down there .

see ! that proves it ! old seti 's fortune 's got ta be under this sand !

are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find the city of the dead ? truly ?

three hundred pounds !

proceed !

i would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang .

you can either tag along with me , or you can stay here and play around with mister maggot .

you sure you outta be playin , around with that ?

are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy , and they slowly ate him alive ?

oh my god , i 've dreamed about this ever since i was a little girl .

unlike your brother , miss , you i do n't get . you 're a whole new brew .

a key ! that 's it ! that 's what he was talking about .

quarried granite with a cobalt lining .

yeah , that 'd bring you back to life .

that `` thing '' gets me excited .

well of course i can swim , if the occasion calls for it .

oh that 's comforting .

i know my treasure .

evil . the tuaregs and the bedouin believe that hamunaptra is cursed , they call it , `` the doorway to hell . ''

yes , i 'm hoping to find a certain artifact , a book , actually , my brother thinks there 's treasure . what do you think is out there ?

still angry that i kissed ya , huh ?

sorry , did n't mean to scare ya .

you swear ?

yes , well ... i know my brother .

no ?

what 's it look like ! ?

shut-up and get me off of here !

after all , you rode us night and day to win that bet .

way to go , evy .

that just makes you more gullible .

i 'm your sister .

he was the last pharaoh of the old kingdom , said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all .

two questions . who the hell is seti the first ? and was he rich ?

yes ?

right now , i only wish to join them .

yes , i know , i do that to people .

what are you going to do ? shoot him ?

lem me get this straight , they stuck a sharp , red hot poker up your nose , cut your brain into small pieces , then ripped it all out through your nostrils ?

awfully .

the jig is up , casanova . i 've spent six months watching you , and know exactly what you 're up to .

i know you did .

our guests are waiting .

what are you doing all alone in the dark ?

well we ca n't call ourselves the mystery people .

hey , do i look like a man ?

he was the last time i saw him .

they 'll think we 're just a bunch of weirdoes .

it 's late . i 'm headin ' home .

he was cute though .

hey ... can i buy you a beer ?

well , i give to the united way , and i feel that sort of covers --

they hurt ... but they do n't stop me !

let me guess ... bullets do n't hurt you .

too bad . plug him !

what are you talking about ?

i 'm going inside .

i 've thought of leaving , going to chicago or new york , but ...

roy .

being a superhero , wanting to save the world . it 's so ... unselfish .

or talk ?

come on , guys -- we 're fighting against evil .

yes .

so , let me get this straight . you have the power to become invisible .

and smell a little funny . we 're not bulletproof and we ca n't fly . but we 're superheroes -- and that means doing what 's right -- even when it 's impossible ... this is our city -- these are our friends , our families -- and if we do n't save them , nobody will ! so i say we take a ride up that hill , blast our way in there , destroy that psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they 'll never forget !

the wise snake coils before he strikes .

but i just do n't feel it .

this place is built like a fortress .

so what else has superman got ?

there 's just not enough of us .

so when are we gon na have an on night ?

leave him alone . she 's his mother , not yours .

look !

maybe she 's right .

let 's go .

what does it matter ? women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings . they want to know why you 're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there 's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just ca n't stand it anymore ! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it ! and then they dump you .

i ca n't .

and these are my associates , the shoveler .

we prefer to think of ourselves as unsung ... i am the blue raja , master of silverware ...

jeffrey ... this is wonderful .

but ... the silverware ?

jeffrey , you thief !

jeffrey !

right .

whatever our name is .

the disco boys .

i , personally , am convinced that he will withdraw his army from moscow , and attempt to establish himself in poland for the winter . in the end , he will not allow himself to be cut off from paris . but i believe that if he is offered any encouragement , by your majesty , he will postpone this decision as long as possible . he is a gambler and he will trust to his luck .

i hope you will forgive me , your majesty , for requesting an audience at such a late hour , but i have traveled all the way from moscow to see you , on a matter which can not wait .

fascinating ! tell me , leaving aside the question of grand strategy , for the moment , what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master ?

and , what a delightful idea !

and , what a great pleasure it is , indeed , to meet you , alexander .

in every practical sense , yes , but , officially , of course , i would have to retain command .

and where is joseph ?

i do n't know the details of the treaty , sire , marshal mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to , and he said that i was to take the army and make for fontainebleau .

unhappily , it is true , sire .

yes , sire ?

i have just had the most vivid ... dream ... about josephine .

i do n't know , sire -- she had the tsar 's personal physician .

excuse me , general bonaparte , but i believe this is an extremely urgent matter , requiring your immediate attention .

was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied madame bonaparte 's coach ?

i have n't been there for three years .

yes , sir . i hope you will excuse me for asking , general bonaparte , but are you corsican ?

but to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible ? it would take a carefully organized plan , tons of combustibles and hundreds of people .

we have already captured a dozen incendiaries , convicts , released just two days ago . they said they were acting under orders of the secret police .

i told mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting .

no one can say how the emperor 's thoughts work , ambassador , and unless we move quickly , he might change his mind again .

you realize , of course , that thousands of swords have been collected . how do you expect me to find yours ?

my father 's sword means more to me than any other possession i have .

you have made such excellent use of it ; i should think you will hate to leave it .

what 's your name ?

well , it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street .

well , one must do something to live , you know -- and i have an elderly mother who depends on me .

you must be chilled to the bone , standing out of doors like this .

to citizen general bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife . you should know , citizen general , that your wife has taken a lover , one captain hippolyte charles ... undated and unsigned .

i am delighted to be of service to you again , your highness . and i can tell you , my instructions came directly from the emperor , with a caution to be discreet .

i will be there in five minutes . go back to your guests .

open the door . it 's me .

i do n't understand you .

i can not promise you that .

and now ?

oh , it 's not the slightest inconvenience , general bonaparte . it is an honor to have you here .

may i offer you a drink ?

and was it so widely known that joseph had reason for such concern ?

yes .

that 's all i can say .

nothing . that 's all i can say .

well , anyway , sorry to call you away from the festivities , but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles ? i asked for it yesterday .

well , two nice little swiss boys , who are virgins , decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello .

i am sure you will enjoy the french countryside .

oh , then you are ...

yes , he has .

monsieur varlac , i will count slowly to five , and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then , i will carry out your execution , on the spot .

very well , citizen lieutenant . you have come to the right place , for i am citizen varlac .

come in .

is he alone ?

life is a burden for me . nothing gives me any pleasure ; i find only sadness in everything around me . it is very difficult because the ways of those with whom i live , and probably always shall live , are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight .

and i can go free ?

anything you need .

never ... but me and suga can get real nasty in that jacuzzi , though .

y'all never use it ?

well , let me in .

fuck , what 's his name ?

it 's something in that hydraulic pump .

come on , day , try it . for moms .

that 's fuckin ' poetic , craig .

what you mean talk to her ?

i 'll do it .

no , man , just wait .

what you see ?

no .

alright , roach , see you around .

i do n't know yet .

ai n't no windows in here .

i walked .

just a little .

who is that ?

you know it 's been over a year since we kicked it last ? up at the family reunion .

karla .

i 'll remember .

you coming in ?

what it smell like ?

ya 'll making me look like a punk .

that nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something ! that 's why moving wit'cha uncle elroy and cousin day-day is the best thing for you right now .

i do n't have no damn cover .

i ca n't get jiggy with this shit . where is the damn manager ?

why did he go in the house ?

who the fuck is that , day-day ?

i do n't believe this sugar shit . something ai n't right .

what ? ! this look like a 7-11 or something ? get the fuck outta here !

what the fuck you looking at ?

yeah .

hey , what 's going on ?

i thought you were taking me to see mama ?

well , craig , you 're welcome anytime .

shut yo ' ass up .

i threw my back , again .

what you doing to my nephew ?

huh ?

what ?

oh , san diego ? i 've thought about moving to san diego . it 's hard to make a living in this town . these short hops . ca n't make a dime on 'em . to lax , pasadena , then i can make a buck . these little hops cost me money .

you just come in on amtrack ?

what ?

what the hell are you saying ?

you were very nervous .

do n't you threaten me .

one thirty . california ballroom .

you fucked up .

then i have time for a drink .

it was n't loaded . i did n't put the bullets in it .

she is presently at the bonaventure hotel . that 's right near here .

yes . it 's ok , lynn . these are our friends .

yes .

what ?

my wife always said i had a problem trusting people .

no , that 's , ..that 's fine

all right .

i know you do , honey .

yes , sweetie , it 's me .

you never saw your mom and me kiss like that ?

we made it .

then why 'd you drag me into it ?

oh , jesus ...

that 's right .

what do you do , if i may be so bold ?

fuckin ' a .

he got onto the pool deck with a gun . how did he get past her security carrying a

he brought a gun onto the pool deck .

that 's good . that 's good , sweetie pie .

it goes in that little hole .

no , i did n't . i confiscated it . there 's a difference .

get moving .

it 's under control .

put her on .

look at 'em . he 'd do anything for her.-

right there .

what do you figure he done with it ?

keep talkin ' , preacher .

salvation is a last-minute business , boy .

can we eat him , uncle birdie ?

do you mind me cussin ' , boy ?

when 'll the skiff be ready ?

when 'll dad 's skiff be ready ?

here 's what you owe me . one , two , three , four , five ... where 's the other basket ? where 's ruby ?

aaa-menn !

ai n't heard from ralph since last christmas . do n't matter -- i 've got a new crop . i 'm a strong tree with branches for many birds . i 'm good for something in this old world and i know it , too ! we know that she will rout the devil .

draggin ' the name of the lord through the evil mud of his soul !

not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse . never caught the gypsies nor the horse .

a man of the cloth ?

all to pieces !

who ?

it 's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow !

that boy 's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep !

you 'll come right out and ask that man of god ! mr. paow-well ! clear that evil mud out of your soul !

you ai n't leavin ' in no hurry if we can help it !

get in the skiff , pearl , goodness , goodness , hurry !

someone is after us , pearl .

pearl ! you ai n't --

where ye from ?

she talks to herself .

pearl , shut up ! pearl , you swore !

under the stone in the floor .

now : where ?

do n't you believe me ?

you do n't reckon i 'd leave you .

pearl 's junk . mom gets mad when she plays out here and do n't clean up afterward .

you think you can make me tell ! but i wo n't ! i wo n't ! i wo n't !

huh ?

no .

about our secrets .

naturally .

where 's the money hid ? tell me , you little wretch , or i 'll tear your arm off !

where 's the money hid .

what 's your name ?

that 's no secret . i 'm five .

how old are you ?

yes ?

is there anythin ' -- anythin ' ... ?

are you through praying ?

did n't you hear me , boy ?

she took them kids with her ?

what ?

now who was this ?

ruby , you did n't have no money to buy this .

bring him out of what ?

who ?

i heard your ma went ape at the security store today . you look like the prisoner of zenda or something . how long 's it been since you slept ?

hello ?

i found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on ventura .

slept like a rock .

not really .

she dreamed this would happen ...

like rod lane ?

had to 've done it . no one else was in there .

krueger .

just wanted to protect you , nan . just wanted to protect you ...

i do n't even have it on me , so forget it .

take this , it 'll help you sleep .

no , mother . yes , mother . no , mother .

do you think i did it ?

i told you . it was dark , but i 'm sure there was someone else in there , under the covers with her .

nobody 's gon na kill you .

i dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater ; i dream in color , y'know ; he walked into the room i was in , right , right through the wall , like it was smoke or something , and just stared at me . sort of ... obscenely . then he walked out through the wall on the other side . like he 'd just come to check me out ...

guys can have nightmares too , y'know . you ai n't got a corner on the fucking market or something .

you want this ?

they must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft ... something you do n't even see .

no , my dear , it is true . that 's how they live in the other world . here we dress to have our bodies covered ... to keep warm ... .

as beautiful as that ? what else ? come , tell me .

an omelet .

i know ... my heart is sad ... but my feet are happy . when all the tanks and guns were roaring over the red square i sat here all by myself and played a beethoven sonata . not bad at all . are you expecting someone ?

right now it 's on the balcony .

... des raisins de madre , des framboises ...

that 's right .

are we free , buljanoff ?

no , that 's bad management .

but what can we do ? ... we have to accept .

and there is a russian saying : `` the cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses . ''

now let 's forget everything except that we 're together .

you think because you represent the former duchess ...

you seem to be a bit nervous , sir .

count d'algout , there have been several telephone ...

general , would you mind making my excuses at our table ? i 'll be back in a few moments .

yes .

yes , general savitzky ?

is this satisfactory ?

only one in the rear , i 'm afraid .

... so it blows up that big ... what they call an omelette surprise !

if you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in paris .

while you eat , you look at the view .

they tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor .

how can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like ?

what is it , my boy ?

we can wait .

i 'll send you a muff .

and if we have to go to siberia ...

what 's the name of that commissar on the board of trade ?

brave ... that 's right .

two thousand francs . if i stay here a week i will cost the russian people seven cows . who am i to cost the russian people seven cows ?

a cow ?

i am michael simonovitch iranoff .

just looking around .

all right , then make an appointment with her so i can see her !

she does n't leave her room ! she has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books !

the same spring we had in paris . just as good .

i acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the power and light authorities . whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you .

i will not repeat your mistake . i will have no dealings with the grand duchess nor her representative .

he is a porter . he wants to carry them .

do n't make an issue of my womanhood . we are here for work ... all of us . let 's not waste time . shall we go ?

i 'm sorry , gentlemen . the other day i heard such a funny story ... it still makes me laugh . it is very funny . i am sorry . oh yes ... about this injunction ...

why should i take a chance ?

private .

pardon me , i am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to russia -- if they do n't like what he has done they put him out of the way ?

i wo n't tell you what came between ... i 'll prove it . it will take a long time , ninotchka ... at least a lifetime .

so -- you 're behind all this . i should have known .

it is their wish .

let 's turn on the radio .

i know ... it 's the russian soul .

shhh ! shhh !

thursday .

oh , everything is so wonderful ! it 's getting farther and farther away !

wonderful -- if one could believe it .

i do n't think so .

well , first i should like to take off my hat and jacket . then could we have some music ?

well , so far it is n't funny , but wait . he says to the waiter , `` waiter ! bring me a cup of coffee . '' so the waiter comes back five minutes later and says , `` i 'm sorry , sir , we have no coffee. '' ... wait a minute ... wait a minute ... i 'm all mixed up ... a man comes in a restaurant , he sits down , he calls the waiter and he says , `` waiter ! get me a cup of coffee without cream , '' and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says , `` i 'm sorry , sir , we have no cream , can it be a glass of milk ! ''

probably not .

on which boat ?

no , i ca n't leave you . i wo n't . not yet . not until i 've made you laugh ... at least once .

death ! death ! always so glum ! what about life , ninotchka ! do russians never think of life ? of the moment in which we are living ? the only moment we really have ? do n't take it all so seriously , ninotchka . nothing is worth it . please ... relax ... i beg you , sergeant ... smile !

your tactics are useless . my name is neither buljanoff , iranoff , nor kopalski .

just an old man . his memory is getting weak .

oh , my barbaric ninotchka . my impossible , unromantic , statistical ...

a polish lancer . i was sixteen .

what can i possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you ?

does that mean that you want me to go there ?

why do you need my finger ?

in other words you do n't know .

what ?

me ?

now , darling , soak in your beautiful pine bath and let gaston shave you .

now ... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs . do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs ? probably not . they have such unfeeling eyes . we 'll put in a great nugget of butter , plenty of pepper and salt ... darling , i have n't seen you for three livelong days ... seventy-two hours !

imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou ! think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages ! i can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments !

i understand how you feel , but there is a limit to everything , particularly pride and dignity . they are willing to pay any price ! they have a circulation of two million !

sweetheart , we wo n't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past !

do n't you find that restful ? ... why did n't you come last night ?

i see . you have calculated in terms of hunger .

i told you we had plenty to talk about . shall we sit down ?

that 's very simple to answer . they were given to me by my mother . they were given to her by her mother , in fact they 're mine , you can not steal what belongs to you !

believe me , leon ca n't help you . he does n't know anything about the jewels ... i give you my word ... i swear it .

that 's all right ... i grow on people .

madame , what is it you people always say , regardless of what you mean ... `` i am delighted to have you here '' ? i have not reached that stage of civilization .

now there you are completely wrong . if we sit down for a little chat , i 'm sure we wo n't run out of conversation and what 's more it wo n't be dull .

it is unfortunate that you have so few more days in paris . be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to moscow . good night . good night , leon .

that depends on the tip .

why ?

here , please ...

you want me to go to constantinople ?

no .

well , comrade , have you heard from your friends kopalski , buljanoff , and iranoff ?

that also is a question of food , madame . i 'll bring you a nice little lunch la pre mathieu .

oh , madame ! this is a restaurant , not a meadow .

no , madame , something of the utmost importance ... it concerns your jewels .

for christ 's sake , it soils my mother 's memory . do you think i want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this ? raising a dirty mouth !

sir , the charges are serious -- first , abuse of power ; second , obstruction of justice ; third , failure to cooperate with congress ; and last , bombing cambodia ...

yeah ? well , i own the fucking casino .

he 's nervous , sir . he 's heard you 're looking for a new director .

where the hell is he ?

good . you know how i feel about loyalty . i 'm not going to let any of my people go to jail . that i promise you . the important thing is to keep this away from haldeman and ehrlichman . i 'm trusting you to do that , john . i have complete confidence in you .

you want me to put it all in writing ? over my signature ?

i agree it 's ridiculous but --

jesus , everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types , the softheads . the average people do n't think it 's much of a crisis . for christ 's sake , it 's not vietnam ... no one 's dying here . is n't it ridiculous ?

we could get a million dollars . we could get it in cash . i know where it could be gotten .

the bigger problem i see is this guy who was arrested , mccord -- james mccord -- he headed up security for the committee to re-elect . he turns out to be ex-cia .

they went after castro . in some crazy way it got turned on kennedy . i do n't think the `` p '' knows what happened , but he 's afraid to find out . it 's got him shitting peach pits .

who 's gon na tell mitchell ?

yeah , i knew it . i knew it from '69 on , and i said it all along , did n't i ...

we are covering up ! for some petty , stupid shit . there are things i can say -- when other people say them , they 'd be lies . but when i say them nobody believes me anyway ...

and what am i supposed to do ? just sit here and watch them coming closer ? eating their way to the center ? lyndon bugged ! so did kennedy ! fdr cut a deal with lucky luciano . christ , even ike had a mistress ! what 's so special about me ? what about lyndon ? he could make a couple of calls to the hill and shut this whole thing down . did anyone talk to him ?

forget it . ehrenberg 's paid three times that much ...

i end the longest war in american history and they keep harping on this chickenshit ! you know who 's behind this , do n't you -- it 's teddy kennedy ! he drowns a broad in his car and he ca n't run for president .

hunt ? howard hunt ?

who ? not another goddamn cuban ?

if you resign , you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... you can fight them for years .

can we get around this , al ?

can the president afford to ignore a subpoena ?

exactly ! we 've got to take the war to them . hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts . more assassinations , more killings . right , al ?

... go on .

congratulations , boss . a great victory ! the madman theory was n't so crazy after all .

you 're talking too much about black africa , henry . it 's killing us with the rednecks .

sir ?

i did n't want him to get the credit . he said i 'd stabbed him in the back . called me a two-bit grocery clerk from whittier .

so ? you wanted castro dead . everybody wanted castro dead . if hunt and the others are cia , why do n't we just throw this back in the cia 's lap ? let richard helms take the fall ?

he was n't protecting me . he was putting me on notice .

no !

the bastard ! if i 'd called his shot on cuba i would 've won . he made me look soft .

yes , sir . i 'll talk to helms , and , uh ... what 's our press position on this watergate thing ? what do i tell ziegler to tell them ?

because the president says it is . my job is to protect this country from its enemies , and its enemies are inside the walls .

just do what i say , bob .

on the list of horribles , i know what he is . and i know what he tracks back to . you say he was involved in the plumbers ?

it 's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal howard hughes donation to the democrats , so the democrats could n't make an issue of your hughes money .

it was just a fishing expedition . apparently it was their fourth attempt at the dnc .

it 's a gift , richard . this law school is a gift from your brother .

is it my turn ?

yes , mother ...

yes . and you will give general cushman full access .

yes ...

i did n't choose him as my deputy , mr. president . you did .

he 's lying , clyde . always has . that 's why nixon 's always been useful . hold still . and take your hand off your hip .

who do you think is behind it ?

i never met the man .

turn this crap off , clyde . it 's giving me a headache ... you may go , joaquin .

dogs ... season starts tomorrow . it keeps me calm . i do n't like going back into the same building four times .

... and now i have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids . i think , mr. president , you 're forgetting who put you where you are .

jack , we 're not living in the same country you and i knew in '46 . our people are just not gon na sacrifice in major numbers for war . we ca n't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks . hell , the arabs and the japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..

only if kennedy dumps johnson .

... uh , i hope this does n't embarrass you .

you have many friends ... and admirers ...

that depends who writes the history books . i 'm not a quitter ... but i 'm not stupid either ... a trial would kill me -- that 's what they want . but they wo n't get it .

yeah ...

that 's right ! and if necessary , i 'll drop the big one .

no one understands ! -- even my own men . what do you think the communists respond to ? honesty , liberal guilt , soul-wringing crap , fathers on tv crying ? hell no ! i understand the communist mind , i 've studied it for thirty years . they grasp `` realpolitik '' better than any of us , right , henry ?

what i think is ... they 're cowards . their opposition represents the cowardice of the eastern establishment . they do n't realize as you do , mr. president , that the communists only respect strength , and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the `` madman , '' richard nixon .

but they all got it back again , did n't they ? we should have lunch sometime .

that was mr. kennedy .

sure , i 'd like to offer condolences .

one of the fathers was on the tv saying , `` my child was not a bum . '' and it 's playing like gangbusters . hell , hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph .

jesus christ !

uh , wait ...

what the hell -- i love her . and she 's great in bed .

you mean smashed ! she called up at midnight last week . talking a bunch of crap . pat ca n't stand her .

when they know you 've got something to protect , that 's when they fuck you !

the lie ?

it was illegal , what he did .

you all know me . i 'm one of you , i grew up a stone 's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in yorba linda ...

... give me a break , mary .

hi , i 'm dick nixon .

it sounds like you 're talking about a wild animal .

i know . i know . i 've seen a lot of kids die , too , in world war ii .

sir ?

mr. president , the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute .

and we got the `` big mo '' ! we 're back !

we got the press this time !

there 'll be time for that .

it 'll be over soon .

you 're drunk !

what matters to me is whether you understand it .

why did n't you ?

tomorrow .

when ?

will you ... would you kiss me ?

and then you 'll be happy ?

no . it 's his way . he hates me . him and teddy . they always hated me .

dick , do n't ...

thank you , fidel castro .

maybe i should get out of the game . what do you think , buddy ? go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid , some money at the end of the line ... you know , i keep thinking of my old man tonight . he was a failure , too .

well enough . you 're looking `` happy , '' nelson .

most do n't .

how come 're you doin that ?

how you been , ellis ?

try `` old '' on for size .

not the one thing . i used to think i could at least some way put things right . i do n't feel that way no more .

no money in his room there ?

would you tell me if you had ?

yessir .

was n't no bullet .

believe you 're right .

... somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun .

i know this truck . belongs to a feller named moss .

yessir . we should a brought wieners .

that dea agent called again . you do n't want to talk to him ?

well . if you say so .

do n't hurt no one .

i got it mama .

no .

what did you tell him ?

llewelyn ?

do n't wan na register it . i 'll call you in a couple days .

things happened . i ca n't take 'em back .

why would we go to odessa ?

your mother 's dead , llewelyn .

fine . i do n't wan na know . i do n't even wan na know where you been all day .

you keep running that mouth i 'm gon na take you in the back and screw you .

you do n't need to know everthing , carla jean .

no . i found it .

we do n't have to do this . i 'm a daytrader . i could just go home .

... you getting anything on this ?

... where 's the transponder ?

you know she wo n't be there .

... me ?

anywhere not in your pocket . or it 'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin . which it is .

... do n't put it in your pocket .

all right . heads then .

for what ?

you 've lived here all your life ?

you said that .

sir ?

i said you do n't know what you 're talking about .

good . i need everything else .

there 's somebody lookin ' for me . not police . just call me if anyone else checks in tonight .

just drive me around . i want to see if someone 's here .

goodbye , mr. wells .

i 'd just like to know your opinion of him . in general . just how dangerous is he ?

waitin ' for my wife .

what about one forty-two .

... i 'm across the river . at the hotel eagle . carson wells . call me when you 've had enough . i can even let you keep a little of the money .

what product .

he is n't . you 're not cut out for this . you 're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles .

yeah . i was in nam .

pot metal ?

sugar ?

how would you describe him ?

no sir .

no ... friends from the diner maybe ?

how is she ?

c'mon , betty , open up ! i got some questions for you about ...

oh , you know , the usual ... keeping the world safe .

little place called `` williams , '' why ?

what about it ?

that 's a nice name for what you need ...

why do i need to see this ? did he ask you to ... ?

one question , doctor , please ! you ca n't do this ! i 'm the press , i have rights ! !

oh , you 're sharp as a tack , elden .

so ? ... suppose betty found out about them ?

junior year !

they no longer live in tepees , mr. college graduate .

it was n't a woman .

good god ... they 're meat eaters , roy , just drop the shit in there !

they 're just eggs , elden , how embarrassing can eggs be ?

uhh , no , we have n't picked a date yet ... well , once he dumps her we will . he 's out pricing banners ... i do n't expect him back .

i do n't think i am .

no one is , honey . here , listen to this ... `` if who i am and who i hope to be should meet one day , i know they will be friends . '' now that 's beautiful .

betty ! listen to me ! del is ...

aahhh ... so what color is it ?

thanks ...

but i 'm david ... i mean , i 'm not david , but she thinks i am ! you heard her ... stop staring at me ... i 'm not crazy , she is !

david , please --

david , i do n't ... can we talk privately for a second ?

no , i mean your dedication scares me ...

did n't i ?

i just want everything to be perfect between us .

i have n't been this happy since i was twelve years old .

yes , she is .

lyla 's very nice .

there was no plan ! i was just young and stupid and scared !

i tried to tell myself it was for the best , that there was a reason behind it . but ... del ?

no , del .

i take it i should . i 'm sorry .

yeah , i guess there 's nothing like watching those tenpins fall , huh , del ?

what ?

all right , then . actually , i 'm glad you 're going out . i got something going on tonight . some serious clients , with real potential .

roy ! what are you doing here ?

you want me to make you a sling ? it 's no problem ...

hey , betty . are you okay ?

hi , betty . you 're looking good ...

i 'm getting back with my ex-fianc . he proposed to me right around here , so i guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop ...

that 's horrible !

i should call you dorothy . when i left here i went straight to italy . everybody told me not to go . but i wanted to go to rome ever since i saw audrey hepburn in `` roman holiday , '' and goddamnit , i went .

if that little weasel ever walked in here i would n't serve him .

where are you going ?

rosa , so you 've met david ?

umm ...

fine .

he is real ! !

okay ... oh , umm , would you mind if i borrowed some clothes ?

it 's lovely ... i really like your aquarium .

man , that is love .

no ... i do n't really know where he is yet . i 'm at a hotel around the corner .

'david . ' that 's your guy . so , you staying with him ?

blake , i can handle that transplant !

good .

no , that should be more than --

andersonville . they did horrible things to men there ...

here 's ghengis kunt and the demilitarized zone . get it ? they 're korean , so they 're pretty hot .

i do n't follow ...

all right gentlemen , let 's get down to it . i need to know if you 're for real .

... but that 's not what we 're gon na do , is it ?

i call it 'nutty ' as my shit after i eat almond roca ...

well ... i think i saw her soul .

it 's a very moving experience , trust me .

you know , blonde , thin , whatever ...

i 'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face .

there it is again . that lousy attitude that got us here in the first place . that `` make a statement , '' do an end zone dance , shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that 's dragging this whole country down the drain . they do n't owe us shit , wesley ! when you finish the job , you get paid ! ! we have n't finished the goddamn job ! !

they paid us half . they still owe us half ...

no , ... like a worthy adversary , wesley . like a very worthy adversary .

betty , betty , betty ...

you think so ? joyce says she 's timid .

we can live with that .

i like 'em small . when you 're inside a little asian chick , it 's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together .

so you see , we have totally different ideas of what 's stupid and what 's not . do n't we ?

stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are , by their very nature , untrustworthy .

bourbon , little water , thank you .

betty was a lovely child .

i do n't think she can do it . you saw what happened .

if you need a minute , that 's okay . but i thought you 'd want to --

... yeah .

fine , but promise me one thing . if we use her , i want to direct those episodes . she 's my discovery .

i know , george , i was there . i 'm not denying that she 's good .

no , wait ... what happened next , betty ?

alright , i admit it , you had me there . you 're better than most of them , anyway ... do you have a headshot ?

what did you say ?

blah -- blah -- blah ... hurry up , will ya , i got a date tonight ...

look joyce , i need your key to the files , not advice , okay ? this is a complex case .

loma vista ? you mean like the guy on `` a reason to love ? ''

oh , umm , yes , this is dwight campbell .

and thank you as well for that conversational hiatus ; i generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation . there are those who attempt both at the same time but i find it course and vulgar . now where were we ?

sales , mr. mcgill , sales ! and what do i sell ? the truth ! ever ' blessed word of it , from genesee on down to revelations ! that 's right , the word of god , which let me add there is damn good money in during these days of woe and want ! folks 're lookin ' for answers and big dan teague sells the only book that 's got 'em ! what do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend ?

well i - i ai n't had it easy either , boys . uh , frankly , i - well i spilled my guts about the treasure .

you mis'able little sneak thief ...

everett , i never figured you for a paterfamilias .

you should a joined us , everett . it could n't a hurt none .

delmar what the hell are you talking about ? - we got bigger fish to fry-

problem a p'seption .

have him join us , run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck 's .

pappy gon na be sittin ' there pants down and stokes at the table soppin ' up the gravy .

that 's not my ring .

... time for this old boy to enjoy some repose .

hell , now 's the time to buy it off him cheap .

it just never fails ; once again you two hayseeds are showin ' how much you want for innalect . there 's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -

is n't it , uh ...

it was in his bureau .

pete 's cousin turned us in for the bounty !

well i 'm votin ' for yours truly too !

i do n't carry dapper dan . i carry fop .

well , i do n't record negro songs . i 'm lookin ' for some ol'-timey material . why , people just ca n't get enough of it since we started broadcastin ' the 'pappy o'daniel flour hour ' , so thanks for stoppin ' by , but-

soggy bottom boys - i do n't precisely recollect , uh -

how can i lay hold a the soggy bottom boys ?

... yeah ?

you got a maiden name , daddy ?

she said you told her in every letter how much you loved her , how you wanted to marry her , have children with her ...

yeah , i know .

better watch out for that kind , zackie . you know what they call 'em , do n't ya ?

that 's right . i 'm on my way over to this officer school in port ranier .

hi , byron .

okay , okay . you win .

what for ?

maybe we 'll be roommates , seeger , and you 'll find out how funny i really am ...

you did n't kick him out ... ? wait , did n't he tell you what he 's been going through ?

where are you from , boy ?

what did you call me , boy ?

yes , sir !

yes , sir !

i 'm not pregnant . i got my period this morning . there 's no baby , sid .

sid ! oh , it 's beautiful ! you mean ...

what 're you doing out of uniform , sid ? you do n't want to get in trouble .

ashamed ? no -- i love you , lynette . i mean that . after i leave them , i 'll meet you at the motel , okay ?

vietnam ?

he was . he died .

cake walk . both my dad and my brother went through it and made it , so i know i can .

you 're no better than me , paula ! you 're just the same !

he 'll show . i 'd bet my paycheck on it .

i told zack about saturday night , too . the fifth week 's supposed to be the roughest . come wednesday , he 'll be wishing he took my number .

great .

well , it you 're not gon na ask , then i will . how was it ?

i got my foot on the floor .

of course there was a baby . i 'd never lie about something like that . would i , paula ?

well , excuse me for livin ' !

i 'm not a puget deb . i hate that goddamn term !

beware of the puget debs -- and we all laughed , especially him .

please stop it . none of that 's true . goddamnit , i love you . i loved you ever since i met you .

paula , he dored and nobody 's seen him .

that 's okay . i 'm used to it .

hey , will you just leave me alone ?

i 've seen all that a hundred times .

nothing . go back to the show , paula .

zack , i dare you not to fall in love with me . i ai n't gon na get serious with you , no way . but how can you resist me ? i 'm like candy .

you 're a very pretty girl , paula .

you got a girl ?

how about that prick ! he told me he was n't officer material because he grew up poor like me .

how do you figure that 's your bunk ?

so what 's the problem ? girls do that all the time .

calm down , sweet pea . she seen a doctor ?

you should 've done what i did . a clean break .

thanks for covering for me .

i kid you not , mayo , i am in love . we must 've set a new indoor record today . you want to know how many times we did it ?

yeah .

sure .

hey man , it 's the neighbor 's house , who breaks in through the neighbor 's house ? !

not that one ? !

you 're here with me , you 're already on the hook for one . buy one , you get the rest for the same price . you know that .

she 's fuckin ' crazy , she killed the kid ! she just killed her own kid !

yeah . she can . she 's fine , she 's just like , tired , she 's got ta rest . you rest , kid . half an hour .

i have the gun .

so what the fuck are we supposed to do ? !

hey man , after all we went through i am not walking out when we 're this close .

do me a favor and do n't talk .

they 're gon na die in there !

yes . yes , it 's all terrible ironic and amusing . you fuck . now how are you gon na get us into that room ?

it 's still a good plan . it 's just ... got a twist .

a guy shows you a gun , burnham , and you insult him ? hey , who 's the idiot ? huh ?

forty-five minutes . that 's all you said you need . that 's like nothing .

you 're an idiot .

fourteen business days . escrow is always business days .

that 's why the key did n't work , they changed the locks .

this was your department , junior .

'bout four o'clock .

everything okay ?

could the child please stop that ?

master closet .

master bath .

third floor , spare bedroom , den , what have you . mr. pearlstine used it as an office .

i said open the door .

do n't take no tone of voice with me , homes .

i do n't know , does n't that corner seem funny to you ?

something 's weird .

what if i spazz out ?

uh uh .

no .

morse code ?

i am . i 'm here .

why did the chicken cross the road ?

fuck .

`` what we want is in that room . ''

feel okay ?

damn it !

the crowd goes wild .

they 're hurting us , baby . huey locked up . bobby seale running all over the country holding things together . cy dead . little bobby ... i do n't recognize half the faces at meetings .

what are you doing with the gun ?

no more police brutality ! what do we want ?

... the police report says he was shot three times but the coroner 's report says quite clearly that denzil dowell was shot six times . and two of those shots were in his armpits . brothers and sisters you know why that is ? because denzil had his hands up ! !

brimmer ! could you come in here please ?

who ? i mean besides the fbi ?

drugs judge , they 're gon na flood west oakland with dope . jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore . and while the community 's shuffling for a fix , they 're gon na snuff every panther they can find .

who 's they ?

judge , calm down .

get out of the fucking car .

damn straight .

well do n't go forgetting your friends .

look this is bull ...

rodgers ... this is no good ...

hmmm . as you know the bureau -- and mr. hoover -- is particularly `` sensitive '' to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left .

i see . what about the black panther party for self-defense ?

it 's a bit more like how can we help you . bay area 's become quite a hornet 's nest in terms of subversive activities . and ... well mr. hoover wants to reiterate that the fbi will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can . on a strictly advisory basis ... of course .

from what you saw , did huey newton start the shooting ?

so talk ...

black people getting uppity , feeding their children breakfast , taking their destiny into their own hands . what 's this world coming to ?

what it be judge . nobody got hurt , sister betty 's safe . this was a good day ...

right on brother judge ...

you are down for protecting malcolm 's widow are n't you ?

we appreciate your help with this .

no man no ! ! tyrone listen ... we got to move man , they got a warehouse ...

what ?

lord , never thought i 'd live to see my boy in prison .

i saw . i saw that big one hit that police man . saw 'em drag you off too . they take you to jail ?

do you think francis with an `` i '' is too womanly a name for a boy ?

you call that a compliment ?

it was you and it turned my teeth black for a month .

i expect to try .

thank you .

prisoner exchange .

unless you would like to claim aggrieved status .

let us . unless you object , i would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and , as such , there are certain customary practices . perhaps i could explain them to you ...

do you see that , colonel ?

i understand , sir .

are you going to meet with him ?

we buried them , then we went to track . it was a cold trail and they were moving fast . we went faster . we caught up to them at kentucky ford .

that 's right .

no , i do n't .

father , there 's something else i need to talk to you about .

she spoke ? susan spoke ?

fourteen dead , eleven wounded , eighteen captured .

lord cornwallis is brilliant . his weakness is that he knows it .

i did n't see any .

is it ?

yes , sir .

is that so ?

we put out the word . we 'll start along the south side of the santee ...

father ...

when i have children , i hope i do n't hide behind them .

you do n't hate him .

they 're nothing but farmers and you 're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard . they 'd be better off letting it move on .

long time .

gabriel .

how many came back ?

i heard about your son . i 'm sorry .

no , he wo n't . there are two things you need to know about cornwallis . first , he is a very proud man , he would rather risk defeat than share a victory . if you give him what he thinks is an out , he 'll take it .

if cornwallis receives news that clinton is coming , he 'll simply hold tight and wait . he 'll fight a purely defensive battle and he 'll win that .

but father , they might come this way .

put those away .

when ?

i 'm sure you 're not .

well , here we are , sitting in my chair . do you think my chair will be here tomorrow ?

you believe in it .

daddy , do you think missy dandridge went to heaven ?

i hate that smell .

yes ... i guess so . he was sleeping on the front porch when i left .

missy dandridge . and she says it 's a operation !

in the end he 's gon na croak , is n't he ?

why ... that sometimes dead is better . that 's all . sometimes dead is better .

because something called a wendigo soured the ground .

jud , i buried my son today and i 'm very tired . i wonder if we could just --

well , she was a little upset at first , and that 's why i thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night ... you did , did n't you , louis ?

wendigo ?

you want to rest a bit before you start ?

this was their burying ground , louis .

you 're telling me .

micmacs used to call it little god swamp .

you 'll see before long . let 's go .

we ca n't climb over that . we 'll break our necks !

the place we 're going is on the other side of that .

nothing . do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one ?

does she love the cat ?

it 's going to be dark before we even get where we 're going , louis . but we can do it ... and we 're going to .

going to tell ellie ?

ellie will , though . she 'll suffer plenty .

it 's church .

i think it is so , ellie .

who owns the woods up ahead ? paper companies ?

what 's at the end of it ?

louis , are you sure ?

according to what mr. crandall says , the road 's a lot more dangerous than the operation . church will be just the same . well -- almost the same -- and we wo n't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn orinco trucks .

do you think i did n't hear her tonight , crying as if her heart would break ? here she is thinking church is going to die .

she 's finally asleep .

well , i 've got a million questions about the area , and -- -

jesus , the road !

mr. gibbs , organize a cleaning detail -- you and cotton . i want every inch of the pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape !

enough of that ! name your terms .

the situation has changed .

i ca n't help wondering , jack , why you 're being so helpful and all ? last time you did that , it did n't end well for you .

the last time you do this , you left me a pistol , with one shot .

you 're playing this as close to the edge as any man , i 'll give you that . we might just have to sign articles , you and i. jack , you 're a pirate at heart , that 's certain .

you 're setting me up for a double cross , you with the ship , and me with nothing more than your word !

you left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do ?

i 'll torture it out of you .

i guess there is a reason to fret .

by the powers , you 're right ! where 's jack 's pistol ? who 's got it ? bring it forward !

because it 's what you 're searching for . you 've been searching for it for years . i recognize this ship . i saw it eight years ago , when we made the crossing from england .

well , i am not going to stay hidden in some cabin , or i suppose it 's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage !

commodore , please !

women in london must have learned to not breathe .

ceremony ?

it 's -- beautiful . may i inquire as to the occasion ?

actually , i find it all fascinating .

he said you say that ! he also said if that be the case , you 'll be dining with the crew , and you 'll be naked .

truthfully -- you were a bit late .

you 'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the spanish main .

you 're right . here 's luck to you , will turner .

you should look at our contretemps this way : we 've got shade trees , thank the lord . we 've got some food on the trees , thank the lord again . and we 've got rum , praise the lord . we can stay alive a month , maybe more . keep a weather eye open for passing ships , and our chances are fair .

what ? what 's wrong ? how will this help us get off the island ?

no , i 'm -- rescuing you .

not if the fool has something barbossa wants . something he needs .

ah -- he 's learned , then . plays things more close to the vest . see , jack was a cartographer , back in old england . somehow he came by the money to commission the pearl . hired himself a crew , promised each man an equal share . so , they 're forty days out , and the first mate says , everything 's an equal share , that should mean the location of the island , too . so jack gave up the bearings . that night , there was a mutiny .

really ? so ... what 's the story on the pistol ?

fine by me . we brought you a nice little boat , so you can all get back to shore , safe and sound .

smith .

this dock is off-limits to civilians .

i do n't like the situation , mister sparrow . the island is riddled with caves . i will not put my men at a disadvantage .

no .

the pistol . when a pirate is marooned , will , he 's given a pistol with a single shot . no good for hunting , or surviving , really . but after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good .

you did n't beat me . you ignored the rule of engagement . in a fair fight , i 'd kill you .

my father -- was not -- a pirate !

he was a merchant marine ! he was a respectable man who obeyed the law , and followed the rules --

that 's not true .

this is either crazy , or brilliant .

no worries there . she 's far more likely to rot out from under us .

where does it make berth ?

move away .

pirate .

... no .

but --

a moment .

dr. bright has escaped .

you got it , dr. argon .

do ? well , i suppose that depends on you .

mr. sim i want you to return to dr. bright 's . i believe she is hiding something of ours there .

you ca n't do this ! you owe me , o'brien . i made you plastic ! i made you !

poppy , please --

i was wondering if you 'd finished considering ?

this is what my entire life has been directed at , this moment , this threshold .

oh yes , icky . i can feel it .

look at me , icarus ! look at my body . i 've done everything , changed anything you asked me to . 'we will always love most that which we create . ' is that still true ?

and you still believe he 's going to come here ?

but , poppy , you do n't know what this means --

she 's lying . she lost the first one on purpose .

she 's working as fast as she can , icarus . it will be ready soon .

no . i 'm getting used to it .

i just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug . what chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you , 'it 's okay , just chuck it ' ?

yeah ? so what ?

make me ? how ? you think he 's going to torture me ?

this morning . i saw someone i have n't seen in a long time .

you want to tell me what i 'm looking for ?

mr. sim , watch out ! o'brien escaped and could be on his way !

things do change .

we were different people then .

god , what a fight that was .

that means the nanobot is still inside him .

what in the ... ?

and i do n't see you sunbathing at chernobyl !

susan !

the waste .

the nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste .

you think it 's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this , like a little maze ! we 're all lab rats running through their maze , pulling lever a or lever b , each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency . all the while they 're everywhere , watching us , two-way mirrors , surveillance cameras , nodding to each other , making little notes .

you think the chemists that invented agent orange twenty years ago were in school saying , 'boy , i really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant . ' you think oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war ?

yeah .

oh no . not by a long shot . i may look like the old daniel o'brien , but on the inside , nothing is the same .

an ass-beating . would you like yours first , mr. sim ?

i get it . you 're the goon fetch boy . the zookeeper argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose .

icky !

you wo n't . that 's why you 're whispering .

under the circumstances , i ca n't fathom what makes dr. argon think we are ready for anything bigger . if c.n.n. , or hell , if the e.p.a . knew what was in my basement --

can i help you , mrs. argon ?

vermin ...

yes , that is what i was thinking .

exactly .

goodbye , miss gallagher .

your house ?

anne , come here . listen

what are you talking about ?

sure - my pal on the paper . she 's subbing for the society editor tonight .

oh no . no , no . not me . i have n't worn these things for years .

of course i am stewart .

what 's the matter ? something i et , no doubt . egg marks the spot

i 'm glad .

wo n't even pretend it is n't a very great favor . i wish there was something i could do for you

for what ?

well , maybe it 's a bit heavy for you . perhaps if you 'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance

that 's a good idea - telephone the police . the number is spring 3100. get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge .

do n't mind mother .

you do n't have anything to complain about , mother . he was all right last night , was n't he ? i told you not to worry about him .

it 's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family . i ca n't imagine what made you do such a thing . a reporter ! of all things , a reporter ! a barbarian who lets his socks come down !

what is this person doing here ?

as one tribune man to another

you 're the tribune man ?

is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana ?

and live on your salary , i suppose ?

all right . give me a voucher for expenses .

i beg your pardon , sir ?

all right , outside !

what are you doing fooling around in here ?

oh , but you did n't engage me , sir .

how do you like your bath , sir ?

gallagher , what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play ?

what other girl ?

it 's a swell idea , gallagher . how 's this ? the wife 's family lawyer comes to see the kid , see - to talk over the divorce . then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore , socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out . how 's that for the beginning of the third act , huh ?

gallagher , that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act .

all right , thanks . now , let 's see . how will i start ? hey pal , how would you start ?

been where ?

stewart , have you ever been to old madrid ?

oh , that 's all right , stew . forget it . as far as she 's concerned , i 'm just part of the hired help .

gee gallagher , do you look good ! what are you doing to yourself ?

say , who 's been tying your ties lately ? it looks rotten .

no , no ! maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies , or perhaps some slightly fried pansies , or better still , some stuffed shirts . and guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck .

mr. smith , i 've read some of your plays and i 'd like an autograph .

how is her family going to feel about it ?

say , what kind of a pal are you ? you 're not going to leave me flat ?

ah ! thank you , joe . tell you what - we 'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties , you know . gee , we have n't had one of those in a long time , have we gallagher ?

thanks , thanks .

on now , stew , do n't be too hard on her . i would n't call her a brewery horse .

well , i 've seen her pictures , and i do n't think she 's so hot .

i 've tried to stop the evening papers , but it 's useless .

go ? ! wait a minute - that 's a great story ! newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from schuyler mansion , and

fine , but kinda thirsty .

pardon me , madam . they phoned through from the mayor 's committee to remind you it 's past the hour for the reception .

i 've anticipated it , madame . the bicarbonate is ready .

pardon me , madam - but what am i to say to the newspapermen ?

heavens ! the man 's insane !

i beg your pardon ?

get out of here .

very good , sir .

yes sir .

smythe , what do you do with yourself - i mean , when you 're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself ?

no , sir !

yes , sir .

yes ... it 's just that ...

okay .

yes .

wait .

yeah . it does .

but i really should get home .

i made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ... i 'm gon na go now .

all night ?

bud , your sister 's a little older now and she 's naturally going to start going out with boys . ... in fact pretty soon -- she 's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here . that 's if she can learn to bake .

it 's six-thirty ...

it 's s'posed to happen , biff .

... why ?

oh yeah ... gorgeous .

gosh . i hardly know what to say .

oh yeah .

i sure am glad you said you 'd come out with me tonight mary sue .

um ... it 's ...

what 's the matter ?

maybe you ca n't even describe it . maybe you only know it when it 's gone . maybe it 's like there 's a whole piece of you that 's missing too . you might even call it `` love . ''

no . they do . and it is n't just 'cause you 're a great bowler ... they respect you ...

wife wants him to get one of those new beds .

it was accessible to everyone .

good . do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to , and in plain sight of , minor children ?

`` it was big ' n brown ' n kept goin ' an ' goin ' as far you could see . ''

how 'd you know how to put it out and all ?

no , not that hedge . the other one .

hear your dad got a new car .

sure .

well ... i just ... can i ask you a question ?

they 're happy like this .

just watch . you know why those guys just get cats out of trees ? 'cause nothing burns around here , that 's why ! they do n't need any firemen ...

it 's too weird david . this place is giving me the creeps . did you know all the books are blank ?

who 's that ?

we do n't have a choice jen . we 're stuck until he comes back .

i still do n't see why we 're doing this .

i do n't know .

do you mind . this is like the most important moment of my whole life .

yeah ... you do n't have rain either ?

rain .

yeah .

how ?

so what 's it like ?

no . i baked them for you .

okay , whose window did bud break when he was playing with his father 's golf clubs ?

i ca n't .

shh ! ca n't talk like that now . you 're in ... you know ...

i know how i 'd feel if mine went out . almost like losing a friend .

it 's okay . we 'll get you a new one .

i brought you something ... from the library .

really ?

wow ... that 's pretty good ...

what are you talking about ! you make hamburgers ! that is the point !

well you can just put on the lettuce , finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along .

have you cooked the burgers ?

well , usually i put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...

yeah ...

well here i am .

saw you at the mall yesterday .

hey .

ok , bye-bye .

i have a few people here , i ca n't really chat right now .

no she did n't ; that 's a lie .

what 's all this pudding ?

what ?

you look nervous .

... .wait a minute : why is this about you now ? why is it always about you ?

yes but i get tense and i feel like i ca n't be myself if that happens .

there 's this girl , this friend of mine from work that i think is really cute and really cool and i want you to meet her so i was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight .

she is . i think , why did you come here like this ?

... .this is your mistake ... .

should i call back and talk to your girlfriend ?

really ? please ?

yeah .

this is really weird and really embarrassing for me but ... .uh ... . i was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money .

uhhh ... i am sooo tired ... i stayed up too late last night , what about you , when did you go to sleep ?

yeah . no . it 's ok. what 's goin ' on ?

ok. sexy voice yeah ... that 's it ... god i am so horny ... i wish i was there to help you ... ..i wish i was there for you , barry .

where is she ?

... yes ...

what do you mean , `` really ? '' yeah . really . what about you ?

no .

this is georgia .

what is this ?

for work ... ..

where do you have to go ?

this is funny .

yeah .

i just wanted to make sure .

well let 's do something do you want to do something , can you meet me ?

oh wow . yeah . that 's great . you came , you came . what are you doing ?

so what do i do then ?

ok. have a good trip .

... yeah ...

so you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought ?

did something happen ; are you alright ?

there 's a better place for us to eat .

what did he want ?

you see ?

-- the promotion says : buy any 10 healthy choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon . so in the supermarket , you notice their products , first you notice they have a teriyaki chicken dinner at $ 1.79 - that 's a pretty good deal ... .but then i noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can ... ..and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it 's a really amazing deal because i stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup . now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label . that 's those little bar codes , you know ? the universal product codes ?

did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that ?

yeah . yeah we get along well . you did n't get along with her very well ?

yeah .

that 's very nice . thank you . thank you for saying that . you 're friends with my sister ?

sure .

ok .

-- yeah that would be great , if i was gon na go but i 'm not exactly sure , i have so much goin on here -- a lot depends on this thing i might do here and if that happens i ca n't go and if it does n't happen then i probably will , but i doubt it .

-- i 'm probably not gon na go though .

six months , maybe five , five or six months ... do you wan na check that ?

do you have brothers or sisters ?

business is good , you 're busy ?

for what ?

i 'm gon na call the police then , sir .

on my knife .

you 're hand is bleeding .

can you say that my name is jack ?

no one will know your name .

it 's ok , take your time .

of course . would you like to talk to a girl ? i can connect you with a beautiful girl if i can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date ?

it 's ... .confidential , the call , my information is private .

thank you .

how 's business ?

can you hang on a second ?

i had this whole thing in my head , i was gon na be able to get this to you today -- i have to leave today --

let 's just figure that out later -- ok. i got ta go . i 'm just gon na go now and i 'll call you from there , you 're in charge 'till i get back . and do n't tell my sisters anything ? he exits .

you ok ?

hey ... lance ... .can i ... ..

you know , please , i just wan na say that i did n't say i would help her out ; i was very clear about it ... .i do n't think that this is fair ... ..wait , wait , wait , ouch , ouch ... ..

is this where you live ?

nothing ... .i mean , really ... change , nothing ... .that 's the cash i have ... .

they need to be scanned individually . they each have a bar code , so i need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt ...

i 'll see you there .

i know .

you ca n't be late though .

you ca n't be late .

what are you doing ?

you do n't need to talk all macho , `` shake him out , little bad boy . '' whatever -- you 're not an action hero , tough guy , you 're not a gangster --

it 's ok , it 's alright . i 'll come right back , i 'll just go pay for my car .

they 've the satisfaction only a hard day 's labor can provide .

`` one day , fanchon 's first client was a surgeon . he ran his fingers across her naked skin , pulling apart folds of flesh , inspecting each and every follicle ... ''

madeleine , i ... there are certain things ... feelings ... we must not voice .

you 'd deny a dying man his salvation ?

free his mouth .

they 've got no right , sending someone to sit on your shoulder . i work for you ; i wo n't take orders from a stranger .

of course .

-- that was lust --

oh , i 'm to be blamed now , am i ?

its horrors , perhaps ! its darkest nightmares ! and to what end ? nothing but your own morbid gratification --

whores and pederasts ? you 're better off without them .

if you only mean to dupe me again --

fuck 'em ! they 're half-wits and pinheads . let 'em die on the streets , as nature intended .

it 's that doctor fellow , is n't it ? he 's come to usurp your place here , has n't he ?

there i was taxed ; it 's true .

it 's not even a proper novel ! it 's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions ! frankly , it even fails as an exercise in craft . the characters are wooden ; the dialogue is inane . not to mention the endless repetition of words like `` nipple '' and `` pikestaff '' --

perhaps you 'll be so kind as to remind me of her name ...

he 'll do no such thing .

what could cause a tincture like this ?

no . it most certainly was not .

and place my reputation at stake ?

no one can fault napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses .

as for the author ... shoot him .

if you wo n't read it to your own mama , then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all .

do n't be fooled , madeleine ! he fears for himself . he 's like a man starving , and you -- ha ! -- you 're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --

if only these coins purchased your other talents , too .

no . but tell him i would .

am i a cursed woman , doctor ? must i be betrayed by every man i meet --

i am eternally in your debt .

what thought is that ?

you 're aware , are you not , that it costs a great deal to house your husband at charenton ...

with all due respect , madame , all france is familiar with your husband . grant us a moment alone , wo n't you , monsieur prouix ?

it is customary to write first , and request an appointment --

for fuck 's sake , woman ! bonbons ? i 'm to sit here , gorging myself on useless trifles , sucking down your little sweetmeats , when what i truly need -- what i truly require -- are a few quill pens ? perhaps a pot of ink ?

do as i say .

of being found out . of not being a genius

thinking like that is only gon na drive you nuts you were a great star and you had a good run . that oughta be enough .

why do n't you come down to la ? stay with us for a while .

the actor

apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself . entirely too much like myself . do you follow so far ?

hope you do n't mind my popping in --

tough shit . we need to t-t-talk about this --

i wanted it

i know where deauville is for c-c-christ 's sake .

well -- he got us , did n't he ? she stands and goes quickly to pour a drink . a forced laugh

one . . . buys things .

how much ?

`` a toast then , jedediah , to love on my own terms . those are the only terms anybody ever knows , his own . ''

hearst ?

that might be a tad difficult because orson is scoring the picture now and he 's very particular about the music --

you wrote the damn thing , mank are n't you going to fight for it ? !

who owns this town ? who runs every goddamn studio ? the tribe , baby . these fuckers hear the word `` jew '' and they start sweating . like ester williams ' pool they start sweating .

i do n't give a shit about-

but it 's not a great syllable

cain -- like the bible guy ?

it 's 350 pages long .

like a jewel . turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated .

i do n't have it anymore ? !

i am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again !

listen to me-

now remember he 's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he ca n't stop us from --

how long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle ! waiting for -- !

oh christ

listen ... i 've got it ! it came to me like a thief in the night ! pure inspiration ! total magnificence !

like a bug .

right-

they came to me with an offer . 800,000 for the negative and all the prints .

he truly does n't care if he ever works again .

not one of them today has what you had , miss davies . not one of them .

i , um , need an estimate on some jewelry i might wish to sell . but d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because i do n't want anyone t-t-to , um , know that --

yes

you 're lying to me .

it was the best , kid

i think you better sit down

i really think you 're

the magazines are one thing -- but hedda ! why did we have to let her come ? !

this is an abomination there 's no music and --

a `` z '' and a `` k '' in the title . that would draw the eye . for the poster . i like that the prisoner of zenda had a `` z '' and a `` p '' and that worked --

take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up --

huh ? whadda ya mean , get up ?

all right . i do n't have to hear any more . i think i understand what happened . i understand it was your brother 's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding . i 'm not sayin ' salvy should n't have acted the way he did . but , joey , you do n't raise your hands . you do n't do that kind of thing . this time we forget about it but no more after this . you understand ?

no , i ca n't wait . you know when i wait ? when it 's important to wait . it 's not important to wait for no steak . it 's important to wait for reeves to leave the ring . it ai n't important to wait for no steak ! i won that fight . so , i stayed in the ring , and that way i made sure everybody knew it . i shoulda knocked him out earlier , sonofabitch .

it 's not done .

but you said `` you . ''

what ?

whatever you touched , that 's good now .

why did n't you tell me about it ?

stick out your hands , jake .

do you see her yet ?

you was n't with her , were you ?

and that hard-on , salvy . who 's he think he is ? i 'm gon na let that fuckin ' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot .

go ahead . i ai n't drunk . take your best shot . on the jaw .

why should i be bitter ? boxing 's been good to me . i got a nice house , three kids , a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her . vickie .

are you outa your mind ? if i come out , i 'll lose the title .

how many pounds i got ta lose ?

i need ten thousand dollars . my lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around , we can get the case dropped .

i promise i just got ta pick up one thing .

no , not that .

you 're the fuckin ' animal ! you ran around with every guy i knew while i was breakin ' my ass for you .

you 're killing him . you 're killing him for nothing . stop it .

jake , c'mon now . do n't start .

you 're not interested in him ?

now take your panties off .

you said i could n't . you 've been good for two weeks ...

jake ...

you go first . let me watch how to do this .

tony janiro 's got ta watch out , eh ?

what do you think , i 'm blind ? my brother 's breaking his ass in a ring , and you 're here with his wife .

joey , relax . you 're taking this the wrong way . why do n't you sit down and have a drink ?

hey , leave the kids alone .

what do you want from my life , salvy ? he 's my brother .

i 'm not gon na tell him nothing ; but if he finds out , he will kill you . what 's the matter with you ? are n't you happy ? you got everything you want .

this is the baby sitter .

did n't you take it to the crime lab ?

mrs. -- thorwald 's -- clothes . -- clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable .

where 'd they take lisa ?

a fact ! last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden . why ? because he had something buried in there . something a dog could scent .

well , in the garage , back home , we --

oh -- i almost forgot !

go ahead , doyle -- tell me he 's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand .

yeah . i sure feel sorry for you , gunnison . must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week .

that 's too bad , jeff . well , i guess i ca n't be lucky every day . forget i called .

i ca n't . the police have it by now .

what 's she trying to do ? why does n't she turn him in ?

now wait a minute --

i handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in new jersey asleep for the winter .

miss lonely hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules .

what ?

there 's something buried there .

uh-huh .

i 'm not shy . i 've been looked at before .

a federal offense .

flashlights . luminous dials for watches . house numbers that light up .

he and his wife splitting up ?

keep your mind off her .

depends one which one .

intelligence ! nothing has caused the human race more trouble . modern marriage !

that 's the hard part .

people with sense can belong wherever they 're put .

too perfect . too beautiful , too talented , too sophisticated , too everything -- but what i want .

she 's only perfect .

stella !

behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause . what is it ? you have a fight ?

stella -- in economics , a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market . absolutely none .

how ?

i know . but there 's one important change . the flowers in thorwald 's pet flower bed .

i think i 'll start reviving it tomorrow , with say -- miss torso for a start ?

weird . why do n't i slip into something comfortable ?

from his landlord -- once a month .

i 'd be no better than thorwald , to refuse .

i 'd like to see your friend 's face when we tell him . he does n't sound like much of a detective .

do they hide it in their husband 's clothes ?

all right -- but what 's he doing now ?

to get on home .

that 's where he 's being clever . acting nonchalant .

do you think i consider this recreation ?

sitting around , looking out a window to kill time , is one thing -- but doing it the way you are -- -- with , with binoculars , and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is , is diseased !

something too frightful to utter .

what do you think ?

why has n't he gone into his wife 's bedroom all day ?

what 's interesting about a butcher 's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper ?

homework . it 's more interesting .

you do n't think either one of us could ever change ?

well , they 'd be very stylish in finland -- just before you froze to death . begin to get the idea ?

you might have to , if you went with me . ever try to keep warm in a c-54 , at fifteen thousand feet , at twenty below zero ?

of course not .

no wonder he 's having so much trouble with it .

not a bit . i was all morning in a sales meeting . then over to the waldorf for a quick drink with madame dufresne -- just over from paris . with some spy reports . back to the `` 21 '' for lunch with the harper 's bazaar people -- that 's when i ordered dinner . then two fall showings -- twenty blocks apart . then i had to have a cocktail with leland and slim hayward -- we 're trying to get his next show . then i had to dash back and change .

yeah -- i want to get this thing off and get moving .

i could n't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you 've been through . and the last week must be the hardest .

big enough ?

it 's cracked -- and you never use it . and it 's too ornate . i 'm sending up a plain , flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved .

buzz ? what are we doing this for ?

meaning me ?

he depended on me .

well --

you what ?

that 's not what i mean . i 've never done anything right . i 've been going around with my head in a sling for years ... i do n't want to drag you into this but i ca n't help it . i do n't think i can prove anything by going around pretending i 'm tough any more , so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another .

yes .

tell him why we moved here .

say , listen --

he 's a minor , mr. stark , and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink .

did anyone see you there ? i mean did they get your license number or anything ?

she keep it to protect herself , sir . she scared without a man in the house .

why do n't you come back tomorrow , son ? ever been booked before ?

excuse me -- but -- you know where i can find -- i mean i do n't remember his last name --

come on !

you crazy nut ! you crazy , crazy nut !

you remember that far back ? boy , i ca n't even remember yesterday .

we 're safe here . i hope . what do you think ?

hey where 'd you go ?

yeah ?

o.k . g'night . i got to pick up my scooter . see you tomorrow .

hey ... you flipped -- or something ? you better take off ...

do i have to spell it out ?

mom -- i 'm not --

i have to talk to someone , mom . i have to talk to you both . and dad this time you got to give me an answer .

if he could --

she eats him alive and he takes it .

big tough character . you do n't kid me , pal . how come you 're not wearing your boots ?

hang loose , boy . i 'm warning you .

grandma ?

it is for me too .

i never felt so clean before .

there 's something i should tell you , judy .

hi .

well -- we 're newlyweds .

you decide , darling . remember our budget .

i 'm never going back .

so have i. but i 've never been in love . is n't that awful ?

why ?

no .

i tried to call you before . judy i thought so .

`` life is crushing in on me . ''

children ? well , we really do n't encourage them . they 're so noisy and troublesome , do n't you agree ?

she 's being called for .

do you think you can get back at your dad that way ? i mean sometimes if we ca n't get as close to somebody as we 'd like we have to try making them jealous -- so they 'll have to pay attention . did you ever think of that ?

i did n't want to stop .

nothing , only it 'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change .

we were romantic then too --

i 've been doing good , though .

all those letters are about to pay off , baby ... all those letters ...

gabriel , let him go --

i got fifty dollars to spend in your store , jesus of nazareth . can you help me or not ?

he says he wants it now .

i 'm almost done .

ash . do n't say it . do n't say my name .

i love you , nick ...

you saved me .

so does it look a lot different ?

he working for them on this one ?

since when do some trucker pals start thinking big , anyway ?

gabriel !

nick , i love you --

what 's going on ! ! !

he read the letters , nick . some day i was n't there . he went through my room . he found your letters .

no boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat !

i told you , nick . remember ?

smile .

i can get another one going . y'know , hey , whatever you want me to --

how 'd you know my name ...

buncha guys in red suits busted in , they 'll say . started shooting . they wo n't be able to remember ... if it was three , or four ... or five . four dead santas and some burned-up cash . merry christmas , the end .

no gun .

six men means six guns .

you guys get caught , i go away for good . i got an interest in making sure you do n't . you need a sixth man covering an exit . what 're you gon na do about it .

across from blackjack , there 's a security doorway . keypad access .

i been driving rigs a long time , nick . four , five million miles of road . worked for people who would n't keep me on less i was driving fifteen hours a day . tell 'em i needed sleep , i needed rest , shit , they 'll hire someone else ...

i do n't know .

what 'd they call her in college ?

bam bam .

i do n't steal any --

the powwow safe ! where is the powwow safe !

we understand you , mr. bangs .

the powwow safe ?

i got a bacon for him and a bacon for me ; there 's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --

my what ? !

fuckin ' freezing .

monsters in the gelatin ...

i gave them me . said some nice things about me , rudy . i appreciate it . but do n't worry . i do love her . and she loves me . you had that right all along .

hm . well . they 'd have killed you if you were n't me , rudy . we knew you 'd start convincing 'em soon enough .

she set them up . all of them .

millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers , real big talkers , talking bout a real score one day . i was in the mountain , man , what the hell , why not let her get friendly with 'em ? let her tell 'em an idea she had , 'bout writing guys in prison . getting one who could show 'em a sure thing .

nick ! ! !

aw , rudy .

do n't look like he missed the sunlight .

shoulda written , rudy ...

she 's gon na be out there , man . right there . right there waiting .

get to thinking about it , it wo n't happen .

what ? no ...

switch seats with me .

you 're hitting for my cards !

i ... sorry , mister ...

that 's what it looks like !

you do n't hafta lift shit . you do n't really work there . but as far as the records are concerned , you do . i call up matthews , the foreman , tell him he 's got a new guy . you 're on the schedule . you got a timecard , it 's clocked in and out for you everyday , and you get a pay check at the end of the week . and ya know dock workers do n't do too bad . so you can move into a halfway decent place without scagnetti thinkin `` what the fuck . '' and if scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit , you 're gone that day . that day we sent you to tustin . we got ta bunch of shit you needed to unload there . you 're at the taft airstrip pickin ' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back . part of your job is goin ' different places - and we got places all over the place .

now ai n't that a sad sight , daddy , walks into jail a white man , walks out talkin ' like a nigger . it 's all that black semen been shootin ' up his butt . it 's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth .

no . that your head 's been up your ass . i walk through the door and joe says `` vic , you 're back , thank god . finally somebody who knows what the fuck he 's doing . vic , vic , vic , eddie , my son , is a fuck up . '' and i say `` well , joe , i coulda told you that . '' `` i 'm ruined ! he 's ruining me ! my son , i love him , but he 's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin ' toilet ! `` i 'm not tellin ' tales out of school . you tell 'im joe . tell 'im yourself .

that i should 've picked you up ?

no . she was from ladora heights .

where was she from , compton ?

jesus christ , give me a fuckin ' chance to breathe . i got a few questions of my own , ya know .

now vic was tellin ' me , he 's got a parole problem .

pam grier .

we were trying to find out what he knew about the set up .

where i was from , who i knew , how i knew nice guy , had i done time , shit like that .

what kinds questions did cabot ask ?

the brewers .

mr. brown ?

let 's go over it . where are you ?

how is he ?

joe , i do n't know what you think you know , but you 're wrong .

i 'm gon na do whatever i wan na do with it .

he do n't tip ? you do n't tip ? why ?

he do n't tip .

that fucking bastard ! that fucking sick fucking bastard !

down to my car .

follow you where ?

i ai n't going anywhere . i 'm right here . i 'm not gon na leave ya .

all this blood is scaring the shit outta me . i 'm gon na die , i know it .

whaddaya mean you do n't tip ?

c'mon , throw in a buck .

what are you gon na do about him ?

we do n't think this place is safe .

fuck you , white ! i did n't create this situation , i 'm just dealin ' with it . you 're acting like a first- year fuckin ' thief . i 'm actin like a professional . they get him , they can get you , they get you , they get closer to me , and that ca n't happen . and you , you motherfucker , are looking at me like it 's my fault . i did n't tell him my name . i did n't tell him where i was from . i did n't tell him what i knew better than to tell him . fuck , fifteen minutes ago , you almost told me your name . you , buddy , are stuck in a situation you created . so if you wan na throw bad looks somewhere , throw 'em at a mirror .

you wan na shoot me , you little piece of shit ? take a shot !

well that 's that , then . i mean , i was worried about mug shot possibilities already . but now he knows : what you look like , what your first name is , where you 're from and what your specialty is . they ai n't gon na hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out . that 's it right , you did n't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection ?

i told him where i was from a few days ago . it was just a casual conversation .

he will be dead fer sure , if we do n't get him to a hospital .

so , is he dead or what ?

i got the diamonds .

yeah , and that was a fucking miracle . but if they did get away , where the fuck are they ?

that 's the way i look at it . a choice between doin ' ten years , and takin ' out some stupid motherfucker , ai n't no choice at all . but i ai n't no madman either . what the fuck was joe thinkin ' ? you ca n't work with a guy like that . that motherfucker 's unstable . what do you think ? do you think he panicked , or ya think he 's just trigger-happy ?

splash some water on your face . take a breather .

yeah . keep a closer eye on her -- and him . shootin ' going on , we 'll never find lednov .

i 've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed .

we 're going to look for him . want to come along ?

you should be . maybe lednov heard about that sonora ranch of yours .

i have n't got the job yet .

like i said , women get in the way sometimes .

thanks for taking over .

maybe they will .

some of 'em you did n't mean but most of 'em you did . i do n't blame you because i understand your way of thinking and why you think that way . you want your women on pedestals . but they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they ca n't climb back up .

i wo n't have you fighting over me .

what does a man usually tell a girl ?

yes . but -- that was the other night . now -- i do n't think i would .

you 're not going out to look for them ?

will she be dark or fair ?

thanks .

i did n't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded . i could n't leave her in the street . let 's go .

his letters will keep .

learnin ' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street .

go on , there 's a good boy .

i 'm not in his shoes , so leave me out of it .

and look at it this way . how about jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot .

steve and me , we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp .

did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over sonora pass ? it 's quite a job .

what 's the matter with her ?

no . we came down the hill a little fast and ... ... the wheel broke . can you fix it for us ?

it would n't happen to be this ...

you 'll live .

sure . what other reason would there be ?

i 'm not , but there 's some of it i do n't see any sense to .

leaving them here when we could just as well take them . we got plenty of room in the wagon . and -- and -- they cook and drive the mules . they do n't bother anybody .

i caught up with lednov in nogales . he did n't like the idea of comin ' back across the border but he came . i turned him over to the sheriff and -- that 's the story .

i 've got eleven horses .

this is an awful nice gun . certainly come in handy when there 's men around who shoot people that are n't lookin ' .

you sure worry that bone . he killed a fellow .

a man i used to know .

i do n't see no sense to makin ' people leave town if they do n't want to leave .

what 's there to be fair about ?

you 're not bein ' quite fair .

nobody asked you to .

i ca n't take her with me .

you can light the lamp . i 'm sure glad it 's you . we were afraid those killers might come back .

do n't ask me because i wo n't tell you ! i wo n't tell anybody ! go away !

if you 're worried about mary and me talkin ' too much , do n't . no matter how many questions your old man asks . we know how to keep our mouths shut .

plenty more . and somewhere up there 's the lode , the rock rotten with it .

up here in the hills , a man gets a hankering to smell powder .

you got no business snoopin ' around --

and you 're all alone .

some people who went by this way lost it . two men and some women . they packed their stuff on horses and went on .

i do n't like to see you go .

what do you know about that . did you sell your place ?

i 'm sure of this . but not of you . you wo n't open any joint . i 've been watching you change . you 're mad now and you think you can change back . but you ca n't . you 'll end up making beds in a boarding house .

you 'd think he 'd do it for elaine 's sake , at least ...

no we do n't . but that 's where we 're going . from minden we take a stage to reno , then another one over to auburn and another one to placerville . then it 's a day 's trip to sonora .

and we 're running out of that .

it is n't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of .

you do n't know what it is to be sorry .

oh , sure .

he 'll treat his wife just as good . maybe better . ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers ?

do n't pay any attention to him . that 's his way and i 've found he 's sure easy to get along with . i do n't recollect him havin ' hit me more ' n a couple of times and i guess i had it comin ' .

sometimes not knowin ' how to read has its points . you ca n't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out .

how about california ?

then i know my alphabet .

are n't we stayin ' ?

why not ? you went farther than that last time .

good night , steve .

you 're so nice .

maybe i could start you out .

but he just never troubled to have you get any schooling ?

i was at first . then i was hanging on . are you going far ?

pleased to meet you , ma'am . we found your trunk . were you doin ' the driven ' ?

that 's it .

well , actually , we 've never met officially , but i bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet . i said , `` i 'm sorry , '' and you said , `` watch it , white bitch , or i 'll put my size eight in your ass . '' i thought how cool . i wear a size eight , too . anyway , this is my best friend , cindy .

hey , brenda .

really ? that 's amazing .

he 's not dead , you idiot . he lives in florida . now , shut up and let me finish .

no , he lost the house after the stock market crash .

are you okay ? i thought i heard screaming .

i just wanted to make sure you were okay .

stop it ! i 'm just trying to say i think we should take our friendship to the next level .

i know , but i 've been thinking --

yes ...

cindy , i 've been thinking about this whole friend thing . i never had a friend that cares for me the way you do ... i mean , there 's ray , but he cares for me in a different way . you know , bringing me flowers . running my bath water . and then there 's nights i wake up screaming and i look over and ray 's in my bed . holding me . and seeing that tonight might be our last night together , i was thinking ...

oh yeah ... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy . more feminine . and her tits are perfect . not pointy and funny looking , or spaced too far apart ...

hi buddy .

okay , i get the point .

yeah , i broke my fall .

listen , no need for you to worry . all that stuff that happened before is behind us . let 's just try to move on .

yes ! ! ! !

do n't worry cindy , the brain itself feels no pain .

no , actually , i found him like this . that 's his stuff .

i 'm hanson the caretaker .

he wo n't let us go . he 's going to kill us .

what the hell are you doing ?

shorty ! you 're alive ! ! but ... what about your head ?

let 's start with some rhythm . sway back and forth like this .

oh , my god . it happened right here . she came home . she saw them .

who ?

yeah , bitch , give me my apple . what 's gotten into you ?

the image there .

well , this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances .

remember , dwight , not a word to anyone .

i 'll make it part of the class . we 'll tell them they 're participating in a study on sleep disorders .

what 's this ?

cindy campbell . classic abandoned personality disorder . she seems guarded , but willing to do this .

good thinking , dwight . traumatized co-eds are a sure thing .

that 's it . i 'm gon na put my food in your ass . i should warn you , i 'm a black belt in karate .

i 'm totally freakin ' dude . i keep having these nightmares , then i wake up screaming with these awful back spasms . i ca n't take it anymore , man .

`` fucked me . ''

what does it say ?

she would n't ...

0h , shit !

what a bitch !

this is so cool ! it 's just like a horror movie .

the `` citizen kane '' of gore movies .

yes murdered ! you said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too . i do n't know ... maybe mom 's nuts !

no comment !

always the dentist .

sorry , ma'am .

you scared me .

chip ! !

looks good , mom !

no `` but mom '' for you , young man . mr. stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies .

tv , man ! farrah fawcett 's interested in playing my mother !

i know this sounds weird , mr. sutphin , but the department of motor vehicle 's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of mr. stubbins ' pupils .

detectives , what is this about ?

does n't threaten me , honey . i 'm happy .

oh , honey !

amen to that . it 's been a crazy day , has n't it ? !

well , honey , chickadees breed in alaska , you know . no wonder dede 's hungry . it 's a long trip all the way to baltimore .

do n't wake the kids ...

we can be real quiet ...

misty , i made your favorite sesame broccoli ...

look officers ! life does n't have to be ugly . see the little birdie ? listen to his call . peter pan ! peter pan ! peter pan !

yes , i did .

sorry , ma'am . we 're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain mrs. dottie hinkle .

no i do n't , you bitch !

fuck you too , you whore !

well , dottie , how come they 're not here then , fuck-face ?

you bitch !

state your name , please .

i 'm stoodup ! i 'll kill that bastard !

just a boy . he 's picking me up this morning .

mrs. ackerman , when you left me at the flea-market , where did you go ?

you want me to keep that under the table for you ?

chip is off to a fine start this year . focused ... conscientious ... participates actively in classroom discussion .

murder , honey .

are we leaving ?

excuse me , mrs. sutphin .

eight dollars ? ! franklin mint or not , it 's damaged goods !

yes , ma'am , it is .

okay , mr. radeau , it 's forgot .

it 's the last door at the end of this hall .

i do n't like this .

i do n't know if i want to go with you or not .

i read your book . the one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking .

are you dr. louis judd ?

i have n't got that much in cash .

you come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally i want to know what kind of danger . i want to know where she is .

i 've come from jacqueline . she needs money .

i do n't know . that 's why i came to see mrs. redi . i 'm trying to find her .

that was dr. judd . he was phoning to say that , jacqueline is on her way here -

what things ? why ?

things changed , mary . the reasons for finding jacqueline changed . i want to find jacqueline to settle things .

who the devil is he ?

please - i ca n't explain things like this to your right ear .

well , i 'm glad you came to see me .

you told me you were pretty good with youngsters . today i bumped into an old friend of mine , mrs. wheeler she runs a settlement house down in the village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher .

however , i wo n't say that i 'll not take charge occasionally , and i 'm going to take charge new . i 've a job for you .

good .

thank you . it was a lovely dinner .

at least i can explain that , mary . your sister had a feeling about life that it was n't worth living unless one could end it . i helped her get that room .

verse -- verse that i wrote . i need it .

do n't be ridiculous . for months i 've had the best private detective in new york looking for miss gibson .

i do n't know .

yes .

he 's jacqueline 's husband . i ca n't

i have to go -

but it 's a small room , jason .

i want you to see my room . i want you to see all of it .

such a simple matter . this figure is the symbol of the palladists .

i 'm at sea , jason .

yes .

bella romari if i were not seated , i would embrace you in three movements like a sonata . ah , my wonderful one . fly with me tonight . we will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies .

and the other was judd ?

you 'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is - when you know she 's a murderess . she killed a man .

i 'd forgotten .

i do n't know how to begin this , natalie . perhaps it 's best to just plunge in . i want to join you .

i can imagine . but you did say you came to me as my friend -- that you were concerned for me .

i have n't said anything of the sort .

because you are intelligent -- that 's why they sent me to you --

i ca n't give up looking for her , mrs. redi , no matter what you 're hinting at .

you mean she just came here , rented the room , locked it , and left ?

she 's not been here for a long time .

but , mrs. lowood , i ca n't just stay here not knowing what 's happened to my sister . maybe if i went to new york -- if i saw mrs. redi myself --

what did he say ?

no -- the rent in paid . the lady asked us to promise , i would n't open the door .

yes ?

what ?

all right ! ! all right ! ! you want to know ? you want to know how i feel ? i feel ashamed . is that what you wanted to hear ?

because .

look at you , look at what 's happened to you , look how you 've changed ! do n't you think she will have changed ?

not entirely .

wait a minute , wait a minute . what 's going on here ? did you come back here just to see her again ?

i could n't face her if i had slept with somebody else .

i 've told you .

but if you were ?

i 'm not in love with you .

i 'm babbling .

do n't you get lonely ?

no , it was wonderful . that was n't the problem .

if i ca n't do it all , i do n't want to do anything . and i ca n't do it all .

no .

have you fantasized about me ?

about me ?

i know . deep down , i know that . it just bothers me , when i have feelings or impulses that she has .

do you want me to stop ?

at some level , i do n't understand your nervousness . have you decided to leave john ?

did you have sex before you were married ?

does he go down on you ?

ann bishop millaney .

that 's a good question .

ann , when would i have told you ? we were not speaking , if you recall .

and they just answer them ?

the ... interviews are about sex , ann .

because i enjoy interviewing women more than men .

donna was a girl i knew in florida .

excuse me for asking , but how would you know ?

of course not .

what ?

as long as it 's not ... gross , you know ? like some scar or something . it has to be like mine , like something about you .

yeah , actually , i do . but john does n't . at least not right now .

yes ! yes ! i think that 's very true . very .

it 's up to you . but i warn you , if you tell me something personal , i might do the same .

do i pay taxes ? of course i pay taxes , only a liar does n't pay taxes , i 'm not a liar . a liar is the second lowest form of human being .

this food is excellent .

oh , uh-huh .

well ... well , the clich about the security of it , that 's really true . we own a house , and i really like that , you know ? and i like that john was just made junior partner , so he has a steady job and he 's not some ...

oh . well , maybe i 'm uncomfortable with my appearance . i feel a little out of place in these surroundings .

false alarm .

jesus christ ! what the hell happened ? i came home and your car was gone , the door was open , i thought for sure you 'd been abducted by some mad fucker , i was literally just calling the cops when you walked in . what happened ?

i do n't know . sometimes i feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world .

my sister , for one . is that who it is ?

i called you tuesday at 3:30 and they said you were n't in . do you remember where you were ?

there are many things that can exert control over one 's life , good and bad . religion , greed , philanthropy , drugs .

ann , in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas . did it occur to you that graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy ?

did you do anything ?

no .

thank you .

it does not .

it looks like a tablecloth .

what ! ?

did he ask you to take your clothes off ?

what kinds of questions ?

he just asked me questions .

then why 'd you call me ?

then what 's the story , what 's this `` strange '' bullshit all of a sudden ? is he drowning puppies , or what ?

why not ?

do n't you think she deserves a little more than a card ? i mean , the woman gave birth to you . it 's her fiftieth birthday --

i do n't know , i 'll get her a card or something .

ann , you do n't have a clue . look , i do n't even know why we 're discussing this , i 'll just call him myself .

`` my type '' ? what is this bullshit ? how would you know what `` my type '' is ?

oh , for god 's sake . really , cynthia , really , i do n't think he 's your type .

i think you 're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together . i think you 're afraid he 'll be undeniably drawn to me .

no , not at all . actually , i do n't think john likes him much anymore . he said he thought graham had gotten strange .

did he ask me to take my clothes off ? no , he did n't .

i would .

how about if you record over the one we already made ? you could have the same date and not use another tape . who would know ?

i never do more than one . i 'm sorry .

do you like the way i look ?

not really . i did n't picture it with veins or ridges or anything , i thought it would be smooth , like a test tube .

very much live .

oh , okay . i think i get it .

i , uh , know a guy at the power company .

she did n't tell you why she was upset ?

the extrovert .

actually , no , i 've changed my mind . i should n't have called .

it hurts that you would say that to me .

you trust him .

of course . she is my sister . i tell her almost everything .

interact , fine , but did you have to masturbate in front of him , for god 's sake ? i mean ...

right .

shit , after what you 've told me , i do n't know . i should 've known , when he showed up dressed like some arty brat .

jesus , i do n't know if i can get away . i 've got a client waiting . i 'd have to do some heavy duty juggling .

when ?

who said i was jealous ?

answer him , goddammit ! !

goddamit ...

i 'm not going to give you my keys .

no .

john , as a lawyer , you should know that those tapes are private property .

what do you think the greeks would make of that outfit you 're wearing ?

hi . want a drink ?

hi .

he hates doctors . doctors and lawyers . he never goes to doctors .

ok , then . i 'm gon na go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself .

i knew the man , emil hobbes , a doctor and a professor at university . i saw the girl around the building but i did n't know her . she never came to the clinic .

you knew these people ?

a man ... i think i recognized him ... a man who lives here . he just ... ... he just attacked me for no reason at all . i just opened the door ... i was making supper for you , and he grabbed me , he tried to kiss me ...

ok. but late .

meeting rollo at tudor 's . might take a while .

kiss , kiss ?

mrs. ementhal 's ready and waiting , doctor .

oh , nick , nick ... i ca n't take this .

nope . damned thing wriggled out of my hands . that 's all .

go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns . it 'll have to do for now . what 's your number ? the number of your apartment ?

yeah ? what do i do then ?

lem me clarify for you .

rollo ! how'sa boy ? i was just thinking about you .

aw , he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls ' school . they caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge . she was twelve . do n't ask . it was craziness , believe me . they used to come here sometimes . do n't ask .

breaking out

you bet , bert .

sin-i-ful

home ?

can i just 'peep in ' on brad before i go home ?

on the contrary . he wants to see your ratings soar . he needs a woman of exceptional desirability .

how did you come by this scenario ?

of course , mrs. majors -- janet -- but i 'm puzzled . if she was so keen on getting him in here , why would n't she sign the contract ?

some people do it on the pavement

in a little masquerade ?

conspiracy is right . the denton dossier is ...

well , betty , there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly ...

some people do it for the money

some people do it for for enjoyment

some people do it for for each other

he was adopted you know .

we 've heard rumors that you 're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight . is this true ?

of course .

why ?

just what the doctor ordered . i know . come on in , my favourite show 's just started .

vance ! vance parker .

i 'm sorry , officer .

i need some

me ?

no ... could n't i do this later ?

and you can 'peep in ' on brad in the morning .

yes , janet . leave the crying to brad .

what does he know about it ?

our field .

surely .

we all love janet ... who do we love ?

and we also know how you feel , we 're not strangers to confusion .

the problem with that is that then there 's one extra --

yeah . all twenty minutes so far have been a blast .

huh .

bottle .

highliner .

oh , that was for , uh , wait ... that was for spray and wash .

how you doin ' tonight , beautiful ?

what the fuck !

hey , why do n't you invite maya to the wedding ?

want me to drive ?

horny as shit . flopping around like a landed trout .

we got ta go back .

ran . twisted my ankle too .

what ?

she gets off in an hour , so i think i 'm just going to have a drink and then ... make sure she gets home safe .

uh-huh .

i 'm thinking it 's time to settle down . one woman . one house . you know . it 's time .

what 's that ?

sure i 'm sure . and just what are you implying ? i 'm really pissed off at you about all this , if you want to know the truth . what 's maya going to think of me now just for associating with you ? you 're the one who 's sabotaging me , not the other way around , pal . not by a longshot .

that 's thoughtful .

keep it elevated .

do n't need a lecture . you fucking told maya , did n't you ?

let me use your phone .

i do n't know . tastes okay to me . hey , they got a reserve pinot .

tastes like the back of a fucking la schoolbus . probably did n't de-stem , hoping for some semblance of concentration , crushed it up with leaves and mice , wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit . fucking raid .

how about this one ? we did n't hit this one .

are they too sporty ?

it 's private .

yo ! yo ! here 's my boy ! here 's my boy ! who 's your daddy , boy ? who is yo ' daddy ?

he wrote a great one on burgundy , and i used to get his newsletter , but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting . plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century , and they turned out to be turkeys . fucker never retracted .

i said okay ?

well , yeah , that 's part of it . woman finds out how i live , that i 'm not a published author , that i 'm a liar essentially , then yeah , any interest is gon na evaporate real quick . if you do n't have money at my age , you 're not even in the game . you 're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir .

i do n't want to talk about it .

but you do n't know yet , so your negativity 's a bit premature , would n't you say ?

they probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it 's not even worthy of a response . i guess i 'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life .

you 're an asshole .

can you give me some room here ?

she likes you , man . stephanie 'll tell you .

nope .

she 's working . i need a break anyway . she 's getting a little clingy . this is our day !

understanding of what ?

i was hoping to get some understanding from you . and i 'm not getting it .

what 'd christine say ?

we were supposed to play golf .

well , i 'm glad you got it out of your system . congratulations . mission accomplished .

where were you ?

i 'm fine !

if anyone orders merlot , i 'm leaving . i am not drinking any fucking merlot !

i do n't know . casual but nice . they think you 're a writer .

you know how often these pourers get hit on ? i 'm going for a swim . get the blood flowing . want to come ?

stephanie , holy shit . chick had it all going on .

been divorced for a year now , bud .

what ?

you have the keys .

you 've been divorced for two years already . people move on . she has ! it 's like you enjoy self-pity . makes you feel special or something .

no rock . when she came to the bar , sans rock .

why do you always focus on the negative ? did n't you see how friendly she was to you ?

ooooooohh . now we 're getting somewhere .

and very nice . and very married . check out the rock .

she is very hot .

you know , you could work in a wine store .

how would you rate this one ?

what do you smell ?

what color is it supposed to be ?

good , yeah , it is a rose . only this one is rather atypically made from 100 % pinot noir .

oh , jesus . look , at some point we have to find out because it 's going to make a big difference .

you know what ? let 's take the santa rosa turnoff and hit sanford first .

and get your bone smooched .

it 's not worth it . you pay too big a price . it 's never free .

speak for yourself . i get chicks looking at me all the time . all ages .

fuck , man . too early in the morning for that , you know what i mean ?

let me show you something . the secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released , you keep pressure on it so you do n't --

that 's a good age .

and ?

oh , yeah . no . i mean yeah , i stopped by for a drink . did n't see you .

like what a fraud he was .

i do n't know . why are you into wine ?

what about me ?

i do have a copy of the manuscript in the car . it 's not fully proofed , but if you 're okay with a few typos ...

so ... you want to work for a winery or something someday ?

a paper ?

`` the day after yesterday . ''

well , it 's a little difficult to summarize . it begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke . kind of based on personal experience , but only loosely .

yeah . definitely .

yeah , same here .

yeah , siena 's a sweetie .

i know . i love that .

try it .

well , good to see you , miles . jack .

maya , how are you ?

where are you ?

stephanie ! stop !

where ?

a hair .

it makes me feel better .

that 's weird .

not english though . you heard the voices right uncle merrill ?

he licks his butt everyday . he 's not going to mind .

... tell graham --

boy , why are n't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of t and a ?

do n't touch him .

no .

it came on about two hours ago . woke me up . we won graham .

from what ?

for the kids protection . all they were doing was watching tv from five a.m. i felt like they were getting obsessed like you said . they should be playing furry , furry rabbit or tea party or something right ?

i got him .

yes , it was .

i 'm not going to curse .

curse and stuff .

why not ?

he was n't drinking . ray fell asleep at the wheel .

okay . so he was tall ?

second thing this week i ca n't explain .

there are none .

the footprints .

they 'll find a way in .

yeah .

no money , eh ?

your next water ai n't for three days .

so i did , i got out of there , i do n't want no trouble . you know me . so i walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back .

i did n't know you were out .

emmett .

have you thought at all about your plans ?

i 've got my people sitting down there ... ... swatting flies and raring to go .

i have n't done anything .

i guess tomorrow at dawn he 'll be proved right .

where you been ?

you know , hanging around with you is no picnic .

you 'll have to deal me out on that . i 've had some experience with that sort of thing , and i do n't want any more .

i got ta be going .

me , i 'm riding along , minding my own business . four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while , friendly as can be . i always figure you might as well approach life like everybody 's your friend or nobody is ... do n't make much difference . we get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody 's pointing their gun but me . i guess they admired my horse . she 's a great one , a sweet little bay .

no , leavenworth .

what 's that ?

and a pretty lady .

the other guy drew first .

is there a place in town that takes ... my kind ?

you 're kidding .

i do n't have any family any more .

you do n't know ?

i heard from stella you were trying to find jake . what happened to emmett ?

what 's she got to do with it ?

i thought we talked about that .

i just got to town .

you 've got a legitimate job .

i like your attitude . but it can be risky .

he left me .

where 's the dog now ?

i 'm saving lives here . the straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather .

why 'd you go into business with him ?

simone , i recognize the shirt you 're wearing . i gave it to viktor on his birthday .

i do n't know how many times i have to say this , elaine , but viktor and i are not in love . i only make love to the camera .

you do n't have to protect my feelings , simone . i do n't blame viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world .

i 'd love to stop somewhere but i 'm late . i 'm on my way to see viktor now .

exactly . now that you have the studio behind you , we can really do things .

do n't thank us too fast , viktor . you know what we have to do ?

how can you bring that up at a time like this ?

can i see you later -- go away for the weekend ?

you 're drunker than i thought . are you doing that again ?

i 'm going to tell you a secret now , elaine . simone is not a real person . i invented her .

is simone back to earth yet ?

she 's lying down . she 's exhausted .

lainey and i just wanted to congratulate ...

she was there . she did n't by any chance happen to mention me ?

i 'll try . maybe live but remote . she 'll never go to them .

the premiere was the first time i 've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares .

-- it 's starting to look like she does n't support the film or you , viktor . if you ca n't handle her , i will .

that 's true .

i should fire you more often . the film 's looking wonderful .

better late than never .

experience , viktor . i 've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them . i 'm worried about you , that 's all . this woman -- she controls your destiny .

not today . she 's learning her lines . you can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget .

you can have everything -- office , car , assistants -- all i want is the picture .

-- what 's wrong with that ?

because obviously she existed , right ?

let 's go , lainey . there 's nothing here .

simone ?

... so much like her ?

sure . where would you like to start ?

no , i 'm okay .

who are you really ?

because , you have to understand , frank , these interviews -- none of this is real . who i am on screen and who i really am are two totally different people .

it was more in passing .

yes , perfect . as a matter of fact , i ran into simone on the lot the other day .

hello , hal .

i 'm sorry .

good and bad . they think that 's what caused this . me eye tumor . microwaves from the screen . it 's the size of a grapefruit . heavy too .

i have her , mr. taransky . the answer to your prayers . the answer to this .

do i hear the sound of ... wedding bells ?

lainey , you know simone and i do n't have a real relationship .

if anyone asks about simone --

only her brilliance . to be honest , with what you had to work with , i was expecting a train wreck . you really pulled it off .

she ca n't watch herself .

there was no other way .

your mother could n't make it ?

-- no ! i ca n't go along with this horseshit ! just tell them they can fry me !

no . thanks . absolutely .

i would n't want you to compromise your ethics .

i do ? sure i do . can we speak off the record ? i 'm a fair man . i 'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story .

she has n't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show .

-- i bet you have .

do i know you ?

we used to .

what do you want -- ?

am i wasting my time with you ? when she sues to protect her privacy , she 'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it .

let it burn . simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy .

she 's already here . she arrived before you and she 'll leave long after you 've gone . remember , under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission .

not , `` eternity forever '' ? the legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made ? i 'd kill for that part .

see beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood . -- see that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake , the scales have tipped in favor of the fake . -- see that if the performance is genuine , it does n't matter if the actor is real . once a performance is committed to film , the blood and bones are gone anyway . only the spirit , the illusion remains . besides , what 's real anymore ? these days most actors have digital work done to them so it 's a gray area .

no . i ... just helped bring someone else 's dream to life .

maybe he can .

good morning , mr. taransky .

goodnight , malcolm .

what , anna ? what did i do ? what 's made you so sad ?

thanks .

that 's very sweet . i 'm okay .

what do those ghosts want when they talk to you ? think real careful now , cole ...

do you know what 'yo no quiero morir ' is ?

you have nice red in your cheeks now .

when they get mad , it gets cold .

all the time . they 're everywhere . you wo n't tell anyone my secret , right ?

your eyes told me .

no gas ... hey , that 's good .

once upon a time there was a prince , who was being driven around ... he drove around for a long , long time ... driving and driving ... it was a long trip ... he fell asleep ... when he woke up , they were still driving ... the long drive went on --

who me ?

know what ?

why ?

you ever tell her about how it is with tommy ?

private kinney 's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism .

how do you draw now ?

i forgot your name .

... de profundis clamo ad te domine .

they want me to do things for them .

they scare me too sometimes .

standing next to my window .

communicate ?

s-ssstop that !

you talked funny when you went to school here . you talked funny all the way to high school !

i do n't know how else to look --

that 's not correct . where 'd you hear that ?

chuck e. who ?

it 's our pleasure .

your grandfather sure believed in it . worked pretty good ... too .

let 's say today , we make it your business .

oh yeah ? why 's that ?

aha . the lovers .

... hi .

suzie , face it . the only `` axe '' he 's picked up since we came here ... is a real one . he does n't give a damn about the band anymore ... or about you .

find out what 's holding things up . i want to get the hell off this farm .

hey , is n't that the preacher ?

yeah . it 's the alternator all right .

looks like the alternator .

gene .

that 's not patricide . patricide is when you gun down your old man .

yeah . marvin 's old man gunned him down .

`` -- an axe ! ''

people say he was a murderer .

i 'll be gone again tomorrow .

nothing . i 'll have us back on the road in no time .

dammit , karen -- i was just ... looking for your pulse .

sheena , queen of the jungle .

i 'm admiring your costume . what `` movie '' are you going as again ?

amen .

not at all . they lynched my ancestors , they smell like manure , they have sex with their relatives ... and they all have two first names : `` bobby- joe '' --

fuck you ! fuck all of you ! i 'm done kickin ' it with cows and roosters . -- and drinking moonshine with johnny cash ! senior and junior !

yeah . good idea . go milk the cows , feed the chickens .

it 's you . you and your father .

suzie ... no .

billy bob 's dead . -- we were wrong -- he did n't do anything . i-it 's the scarecrow --

i said that 's enough !

last night ... he tried to get it on with me .

carl ? ? ? carl did this ? ! !

like what ?

i 'll tell you what , no one with lyme disease gon na win any damn handsome contests !

sherry , you gon na create a hysteria ?

and this is mine .

you took bill .

my father , he was -- he was real close to evil . people did n't know . still do n't . from the time i was a toddler he 'd beat the hell out of me . i do n't mean just like a smack for smart -- mouthing ... he took a real enjoyment in it . and when i turned eleven or twelve , things ... well , they got worse . starla looks at bill , who seems struck .

was always curious why you ... married grant in the first place ... just never seemed outta love .

starla , it ai n't --

well that 's only if you 're in the wrong spot .

where are you ? !

and then we get here , the castavets ' , where last night 's shit -- storm took place .

i think we best get you to a hospital right quick .

slugs ? no . 'less you talkin ' about that new waitress down at sloan 's ! ha ha !

listen , you got any reports of ... i do n't know what you call 'em . they look like big slugs , only fast .

where 's the old half -- mexican ?

that 's not true -- where are you -- ?

through a wound on his stomach ?

but not always . i was -- he was ... other stuff too .

maybe you better sit back down . you do n't look so good .

ai n't no mystery to it . she 's raised in them shanties off st. luc . dirt -- poor .

four hundred cases worth . well ?

america 's bored . now , what do you want ?

yeah , it 's the highlight of my day .

see ya , kate .

listen , he 's nuts . i mean certifiable . but believe it or not , he once looked great in levis . that 's why my mother married him . but like all good things ... i know what you 're thinking .

what can i say ?

the minute you see him , you 'll know .

-- actually , my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named ramblin ' bobby holt . when i turned twenty- one , i went to europe with visions of being free and independent . my luck , he was on the plane . i landed in paris and fell in love before i could claim my baggage . we were together for almost a year . i thought he was it .

forget it . this is one of the longest relationships i 've ever had . i 'm not blowing it now .

you plan on driving trucks all your life ?

-- trucking ai n't the easiest life in the world . i mean , you ca n't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit do n't get a gold watch when you hang it all up . but i like keeping on the move . you know ?

you might have said no . i have trouble handling rejection .

by stealing my car ?

what the hell are you doing ? ! ?

ciao .

jesus ! ! !

well ?

a what ?

kate mcconnell .

i 'm begging .

why should i ?

no what ?

do n't take that foot off the hammer , 'cause you got wall-to-wall bears about to pour over you like maple syrup .

bandit ii ?

let 's boogie .

just fine . what 's the weather like ?

you okay ?

you 're gon na hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes . better let your flaps down , these roads are killers when they 're damp .

i 'm at marker eight-five .

as far as john law knows , i 'm just a joy ridin ' georgia redneck . we keep 'em outta your backyard , we 're cool . now just give me five to ditch this idiot and i 'll meet you in ole miss .

what 's a texas smokey doing in arkansas , man ?

i 'm 'bout four miles ahead of you , turkey .

this is bandit ii . now , where the hell are you ?

tell him we 'll be back on the highway in a second .

save it . we got a long haul .

let 's keep it that way .

yeah ?

now , if i say go to channel three , it really means go to six .

running blocker .

i do n't know , man . ask him ?

how long 's this gon na take ?

breaker . breaker .

thanks much , silver tongued devil .

about one to five years worth .

gim me three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff .

how 's your twenty ?

yes , ma'am .

i 'm kate . you must be cledus .

shut up , fred .

but if it ca n't be done , how 's he gon na do it ?

-- yeah , banana peel , go head on .

yes , but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall , twenty-four hours a day .

no . i 'm going over there . you take the car from there , get out to the lake .

that 's happening in about ten minutes . israel 's at optimum risk of flight right now , so we ca n't wait .

did the justice lawyers sign off ?

and that did n't seem odd to you ?

yeah .

uh , yeah .

the other agent . he said he was here to do an inspection and later , when he got on the elevator with the other guy , carruthers , i saw him wearing one of our security jackets ...

-- agent carruthers . do you know where is he now ?

really ?

... about what ?

two security levels , the one we 're going in under the guise of , hotel security , has restricted access . they 're mostly there to monitor the lobby , handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks . there 's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift . if we split up , we can blend in and enter unnoticed . once we 're inside the hotel , we 'll regroup .

what happened ?

answer your fucking pages ! i 've been calling for fifteen minutes , we need you up here to clean now !

i am . yeah .

look at that , we did n't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all . now , do you know anything about that ?

then why are you still looking at me like i 'm asking for the square root of something ! what did you say ! ?

and i vibe that kiddo , i do indeed , but it 's one ' a those fait accompli things , you have to --

i dunno what to say to you sweetheart , it is what it is .

it was n't elective . it was undertaken to save his life . and it was n't cosmetic , it was reconstructive ... look at the date of the first procedure .

and you just figured that out ? the swede is n't a hitman , is he ? he 's a surgeon . sparazza did n't want israel 's heart for a trophy , he wanted it for a transplant ... why ?

sparazza was the one who introduced israel to the life , gave him his first big break , brought him through the ranks .

-- no , no , not when y'can see the shore . i hear ya .

how are we on time ... ?

okay -- yeah , i can , i respect that .

that 's not a problem . are we goin ' outta pocket ourselves ?

wow .

-- who can say . he 's off his onion , y'know , he 's old school sicilian , this is how they hate .

-- yeah , now lem me finish , i was eavesdroppin ' , so give me sec , lay this thing out , since the information might be a little loose --

alright , now buzzy -- this is , this is it , here , okay , so listen to me careful and wait till i 'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop .

yeah ... sid ?

well , if it 's any comfort , i 's goin ' in to there to act a fool baby . straight rockin ' heat and slayin ' niggas --

... shhhhhhit ... girl , there 's these two dudes , just sittin ' here in this elevator , all shot up ...

security 's locking down the elevators .

jus ' remember , this is more rescuin ' shit than rampagin ' shit ... what are you shootin ' ?

i'mma grip and rip girl . i got some handloads here ready to cut heads .

a fed ? like fbi ?

nuthin ' , we cool . there was somethin ' about a fed being in the building .

what are we talkin ' on the split ...

and you 're not ? maybe you 're my puppet . but like all puppets , you think you 're actually human . it 's the puppet 's dream . wondering if they 're human !

what i 'm saying is : do n't trust anyone . find yourself a weapon of some sort .

she 'll come back .

yes .

where 's his body ?

oh , right away . that 's why you never saw me with anyone . you should 've noticed that . i miss him , though . i think i made a mistake .

when did this happen ?

what plan ?

she knows everything . she knows who she is .

i 've never heard you express any desire to leave before now . why now ?

consciousness is enough , that 's all i 've saying . consciousness should be enough for anybody .

-- we are not sure of that . we are not sure we are n't all hallucinating .

you 're unnerved because you 've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you , and suddenly your subconscious is an open book . we are , for the first time , experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own . that proves that --

is it being deliberately cruel , you mean ? i do n't think so .

can you meet me and sartorius on b deck in an hour ?

what is it ?

will she come back ?

rheya .

my wife .

i told you , try to stay calm . you 're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch .

gibarian warned me . he left me a message .

where 's sartorius ?

how ?

last night . you were talking to someone in the corridor .

i do n't know . something . anything .

am i really her ?

do n't do this . i am literally begging you not to do this . chris .

you said he was dead .

you 're the coward .

can you sleep ?

i 'm sure there are worse people to talk to , but i do n't know who they are .

stop .

yes . yes .

do i really feel like ... i am ... ?

i ca n't help feeling that i 'm cheating when i take them .

why did you say those things ?

scared . no , not scared . wary . like i was something to be ... her guard went up . i was a threat . now i know why . she was afraid she 'd be seen . that i would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was . i think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal . but that 's the cycle , right ? i knew a little more than she did , she knew a little more than her mother , and on and on . i guess that 's part of the reason why --

not exactly . it exists in a continuum that was n't proven until ten years ago , a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the universe . an infinite number of them , in fact . it was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the universe , space , or space-time . it was completely counter-intuitive . we had to unlearn everything .

rheya . not here .

what are they ?

yes .

fuck me . i knew it .

are the actions of solaris premeditated ?

listen , i 'll ... see you again .

i think it 's probably still a good idea .

you do n't have to , now .

... mike .

i 'll have to pack a lot of clothes .

oh god , that 's great !

you do n't want to know .

what do you want to do ?

more bullshit ! more bullshit ! what kind of odds are they giving me ? there must be some kind of office pool . one month ? a couple of days ?

it 's just me . i want to talk to you . let me in ...

you could do better .

he 's very caring , in his way . you have n't seen him at his best .

okay . let 's just see if a mugger gets me .

and die laughing , because you 're walking so stupid !

that 's the dumbest walk i ever saw !

sooner , the better .

i got money .

are you nervous ?

oh ... yes ... i do n't have it with me . it 's at home .

there 's a phone in the car .

you 're planning to speak ?

it was something my father always liked me to do .

you 're dealing with a psychopath . he gets out of jail in ten years , or five ... or ninety days , and you 'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life ...

claire ...

hey , can we go to mcdonald 's ?

keep what handy ?

he 'll live through it . they all live through it . what a world , huh ?

d'you have to say `` fucking '' every other word ?

it is my fault ! i 'm responsible for her !

i 'll be right up .

i do n't know why she bought me a tie ! -- she 's a generous person -- and she 's a nice person -- and i could be settin ' her up to be killed ... you want the fuckin ' tie ?

i think television 's a dangerous thing .

do n't start ... the only reason is that the neighborhood 's shi ... ... crummy . i just do n't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night .

tomorrow , i start looking for our house ... you love me ?

take my advice , do n't buy any ...

they 're operating on him . he 's still alive .

if she identifies him . where the fuck were you anyway , cowboy ! venza was meat . he walked right past you , and now we 're the ones playing catch-up ! you better hope she identifies him .

do it , or look for another profession . that 's a choice i guess .

you 're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer .

that would be lieutenant garber , and he 's very busy upstairs ...

koontz ! let her come in ! claire ! it 's pitch dark in here ! you 're gon na have trouble seeing anything , so just come in , and straight down a long hall . then stand at the door so we can see you . we want to see your face and we wo n't be able to until you get to the kitchen door !

why should she come in ?

how do i know that 's her ?

i 'll prove it !

what 're we having ?

s'funny . when your mom and dad , uh , passed away , i had this idea . i wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world .

you stop him ?

i was there .

flash , drop it --

no , no , listen . they 're tryin ' to say he was in cahoots with this killer --

come on , laughter 's the best medicine !

lizzy !

why home ? the real world beckons , man ! the possibilities are endless . want to go up to the world trade center and laugh at new jersey ?

no ! washington square , manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like a-bombs . did you get pictures ?

i bet you do n't think i appreciate you , parker . i do .

parker -- you go here , right ? got your camera ?

just about . you see , i also have this amazing strength ...

when peter was little , he loved to hide . in closets , under the sink . he needed a secret place . but when i 'd look for him , he 'd laugh ... he wanted to be found .

i 'm here ...

may 's much better . she 'll be out soon .

you 're not trained for that . none of us are ... i mean , sometimes i ... okay , let 's say you had gone back . what then ? are you bulletproof ?

this from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel ?

no , it was n't only you -- it -- it just was n't my style . hey , look -- let 's go to lunch . someplace nice for a change .

what 's your problem ?

some prep school thing .

you want to give them something , but they 'll just buy more ripple . and they smell so ... bad .

i suppose .

i hate the platonic idea of you .

huh ?

lieutenant , i 've triangulated recent bizarre events -- the bronx , jersey , brooklyn -- all rippling out from -- here . the e.s.u . science center . octavius ' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time , drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding , electromagnetism and gravity --

see ? you big dullard .

you were adorable . the least you could do is use a glass .

no .

aunt may , you 're trespassing .

doubtless . and you 'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work . somewhere else .

no !

proof . proof of a unified field . not just theory and equations -- experimental proof .

i left a paper in my desk .

oh . yeah . thanks .

how much do you know about it ?

... a couple a drinks at sardi 's ?

phooey on that .

no , but i 've got this secret identity to worry about . i 'll swing the rest of the way .

do n't let him kid you . cagney could n't have pulled a sweeter job . all right , boys . we were waiting in the depot in frankfurt , see ? and there was an ammunition train coming through , the longest ammunition train you ever saw , see ? so dunbar gets himself in the men 's room , see ? fixes himself a time bomb , busts open the window and just as the train moves out , lays the thing in there , see ? so then , he comes out like nothing 's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom ! broke every window in frankfurt . it was gorgeous !

forget it . he 'll be back here . they 've got no proof .

what 's the match gag ?

throws what ? how could he have a time bomb ?

there was that ammunition train in the depot at frankfurt , see ? so dunbar gets himself in the men 's room and fixes a time bomb , see ? then he waits until the train starts moving out , see ? and one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor , see ? so he throws it , see , and three minutes later -- voom ! see ?

maybe just a hint or so . think hard .

come on !

they ought to be under the barbed wire soon .

if you do n't want to tell me , why do n't you tell hoffy ? or security ?

that 's not the point , cookie . the point is what do you do with him ? you tip your mitt and the jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else , like stalag sixteen or fifteen . or you kill him off and the krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks . every one of us . so what do you do ?

we 'll get some more .

just what makes you and them krauts so buddy-buddy ?

a lot sharper , sefton ! i 'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers !

what 's your beef , boys ? so i 'm trading . everybody here is trading . only maybe i trade a little sharper . so that makes me a collaborator .

how did he get over there ?

tipping me off ? i do not understand .

you killed them , huh ? both of them ?

i do n't know what you 're talking about , colonel .

i 'll live .

105-353 .

simply this . after the hostilities are ended , there will be such a thing as a war crimes commission . if this man should be convicted without proper proof , you will be held responsible , colonel von scherbach .

he is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage .

say , schulz --

you want to go ?

this is me , animal ! it 's harry shapiro !

you do n't want to cry over a dame that does n't even know you 're alive ! snap out of it !

come on , animal -- let 's trip the light fantastic !

hey , here 's esther williams .

what do those broads say ?

blind ? how stupid can you get , animal ? i drank the stuff myself .

bombs away !

she 'll never forgive me !

so what ? there 's other women !

do n't you remember , animal ? a chicken lays those things .

no . your eyeball goes . the top of your head . got ta wind up with athlete 's stomach .

curtains would do wonders for this barrack . you will not get them .

you have a lieutenant here ...

just as you say , hoffy . but would n't it be smarter if i went out and kept schulz tied up ?

you must get out . for your own good , you must get out .

says who ?

anybody call ?

yeah ?

six o'clock in berlin . they were having lunch in cleveland . am i boring you , boys ?

the germans know where dunbar is .

do n't bother , sefton . i do n't like you . i never did and i never will .

are you questioning me ?

three hundred and sixty-fifth bomb squadron ? out of chelveston ?

suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut .

or how about a game of pinochle ? no , you 're not a pinochle man . you 're a chess player . i have n't played since i was a kid . let 's see -- -- a pawn moves this way , does n't it ? and a bishop this way ? and the queen -- every which way , does n't it ?

let us see . we have now two empty bunks here . nummer einundsiebzig und nummer dreiundsiebzig in baracke vier .

how many do you want ? a thousand ?

good morning , sefton .

so you 're stuck with me , eh ?

from a chicken , bug-wit .

he is .

according to our current information , the destruction of the amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector : gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent , the starship bozeman was forced to make a course correction , a research project on gorik iv was halted due to increased neutrino particles , ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-

data , you 're not thinking about using that thing are you ?

the ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. distance : three light years .

wherever he wanted to be .

you 're in the nexus .

i ca n't remember very much - what it looked like or how long i was there . but i do remember how it felt .

what 's the `` nexus '' ?

you left spacedock without a tractor beam ?

prepare to leave spacedock . aft thrusters ahead one quarter , port and starboard at station keeping . captain kirk , i 'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway .

oh , of course .

that 's right .

where are the deflector relays ?

a photon torpedo ?

and what would that be , sir ?

we learn something new about ourselves every day . now . maybe i did n't make myself clear . it is very important that you tell me exactly what captain picard knows .

how is that possible ?

we think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart .

bad food , brutal discipline . no women .

it 's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies . but it goes deeper than that , does n't it ? i can sense that rene meant a great deal to you .

time has no meaning there . the predator has no teeth .

we 're doing the best we can . now if you 'll excuse me ...

i do not see how . the plasma coil is part of their cloaking device .

lursa and b'etor ? this does n't make any sense . a renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star , kidnaps geordi and escapes with a pair of klingon renegades . why ? what the hell 's going on ?

short range scan , mr. chekov ... on screen , mr. sulu .

i 'd swear something was there sir , but i might have imagined it .

still no response , sir .

unit two , this is one . the kobayashi maru has set sail for the promised land . acknowledge .

on screen .

i do n't believe it ...

in code to starfleet ... captain 's spock 's tube located intact on genesis surface . will relay more data on subsequent orbits .

i do n't understand .

it will be hardest on spock . soon he will feel the burning of his vulcan blood .

it 's time for total truth between us . this planet is not what you intended , or hoped for , is it ?

that may be difficult ...

how can you be logical at a time like this ? ! we have to get thee hell off this planet !

what is it ?

david --

check for trace radiation . infrared enhancement .

short range scan .

it 's snow . snow in the same sector . fantastic !

we are under attack ! stand by for evasive -- stand by for --

i 'm sure starfleet would approve , sir .

well , all the same , i 'm going to advise starfleet and get instructions .

precautionary , mr. chekov . shields up ...

scan for vessels in pursuit !

what happened ... ?

the ship ... out of danger ... ?

because ... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many .

mr. sulu , you 're on manual .

saavik . send to ambassador sarek . tell him we 're coming in .

... a cloaking device ?

will you be able to handle that ... ?

yes , admiral . step into my parlor .

standby automatic approach system ... advise approach control .

out of the question ! the council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to genesis !

then i 'll find a ship -- i 'll hire a ship .

no , jim ! enterprise would never stand the pounding .

jim , the enterprise is twenty years old . we think her day is over ...

welcome home , jim .

no .

you should take the vulcan , too .

there are two more prisoners , admiral . do you want them killed too ? surrender your vessel !

admiral , your young friend is mistaken . i meant what i said . and now , to show my intentions are sincere ... i am going to kill one of the prisoners .



report status !

if i had n't tried , the cost would have been my soul .

what you ask is difficult .

then , how --

because he asked you to ! he entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body . he asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you : his katra . his living spirit .

`` met his death '' ? how could you , his friend , have assumed that ? why did you leave him on genesis ! spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future !

perhaps they wish to take you prisoner .

killing his son was < u > stupid < /u > ! it made kirk willing to die .

my lord ... what are your orders ?

well -- what are we going to do about it ? !

commander , these are some of the most famous people in starfleet ! admiral kirk , my god !

young . i feel young , doctor .

until now .

how can you think of food at a time like this ?

computer . request security procedure and access to project genesis summary .

shore leave , admiral .

i 'm your doctor and i 'm your friend , jim . get back your command . get it back before you really do grow old . before you turn into part of this collection .

... see you but ca n't hear . did you ... order ... ?

... taking genesis away from us ...

... ca n't read you ... repeat ...

this ? it took the starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this . what we did in there -- we did in a day . david , why do n't you show dr. mccoy and the lieutenant our idea of food .

will you please be quiet ! we must have order here . this has to be some sort of mistake .

every time we have dealings with starfleet , i get nervous . we 're dealing with something that could be perverted into a dreadful weapon . remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with ? that 's exactly the --

and bored . i know . but maybe it is something they can ...

i saw it -- !

khan , listen to me ! captain kirk was only doing his duty ! you --

not like this -- no . i have n't faced death , i cheated death . i tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity . i know nothing .

you ca n't !

visual --

no !

they wo n't --

give me some time to recall the data on our computers --

saavik , for god 's sake , tell her we 're all right .

sensors , captain ?

picture , mr. saavik .

< u > why < /u > ?

midshipman first class peter preston , engineers mate , sir .

i have been -- and always will be -- your friend ... live . long . and . prosper .

spock ... !

the ship -- out of danger ?

i think we can guarantee she 'll follow us , mr. saavik . remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego .

what is working around here ?

regula is class `` d ' . it consists of various remarkable ores . essentially , a great rock in space .

there are two possibilities , sir they are unwilling to respond , they are unable to respond .

so you said at the time . speaking of which , your protg 's first rare -- a trifle emotional --

it had the virtue of never having been tried .

i assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating i plan to give your cadets .

kirk here .

time from my mark ...

all stop , sir .

mr. saavik , all stop .

they just do n't want us going in there .

come , come , lieutenant , you of all people go by the book . hello , spock . you remember dr. marcus ...

i changed the conditions of the test . i received a commendation for original thinking . i do n't like to lose .

i did not think so .

i wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating .

how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life , would n't you say ?

because ... there was no way to win .

phaser lock inoperative , sir .

< u > i did nothing < /u > -- except get caught with my britches down . i must be senile . mr. saavik , you just keep right on quoting regulations . meantime , let 's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we 've been --

i really must thank you .

may i remind the captain that if a starship enters the zone --

by the book ...

never , sir .

aye , sir .

we ca n't all be perfect , saavik . you must control your prejudices and remember that as a vulcan as well as a romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land . around you are humans , and as a member of the starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence . you must learn to tolerance in addition to all else i have taught you . tolerance is logical .

then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed , feeling , human friends . they have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the < u > one < /u > -- you -- was more important to them .

and finally , they 're not human beings , you know . their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --

no ! no ... what did you have in mind ... ?

congratulations , jim . i think you 've saved the earth .

jim , you 've got to let me go in there ! do n't leave him in the hands of twentieth century medicine .

sure , slingshot around the sun . if you pick up enough speed you 're in time warp . if you do n't , you fry..

your perception is correct , doctor ... in order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd century , i have used our journey back through time as a referent , calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve .

you , ah ... you present the appearance of a man with a problem .

hamlet , act i scene 4 .

i liked him better before he died .

you mean i have to die to discuss your insights on death ?

a simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure .

what 's causing that ! ?

i 'm wery sorry , but --

like what ?

shields , mr. chekov .

that 's odd . uhura , what 's on the comm channels ... ?

most prudent . engine room . report , scotty .

we are launching everything we have .

hey ! -- where you going ? !

you tricked me .

calm yourself , nurse . scotty , get us out of here !

we 'll bring them up just like we brought you . it 's called a transporter beam ...

have i flipped out ? ... is any of this real ?

here ... in the park ?

... who are you ?

let 's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived . problem is , they wo n't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year ... so that , as they say , is that . damn .

my whales ? where could you take them where they 'd be safe ?

just a little joke . see you later , old friend .

he 's harmless . back in the sixties he was part of the free speech movement at berkeley . i think he did too much lds .

i assure you that wo n't be necessary . we were only trying to help ...

soon ... it 's too bad because they 're very friendly as you can see . i 've grown quite attached to them ... this way .

you mean man ...

they did , admiral .

< u > you ? < /u > spock , that 's extraordinary .

admiral , you must wait one damn minute .

the tank will be finished by morning ...

i believe i was successful in communicating our intentions .

what else did you learn from your mind meld ?

ah ... the giants .

you mean profanity . that 's simply the way they talk here . nobody pays any attention to you if you do n't swear every other word . you 'll find it in all the literature of the period .

... simple logic .

but you said toxic .

not with this equipment . i have had to program some of the variables from memory .

in progress , admiral .

that leaves us no choice . we must destroy the probe before it destroys earth .

the humpback was indigenous to earth . earth of the past .

sir -- i 've got some back pressure on manual --

advise reaching 10,000. steer three-one-zero .

mr. sulu ... ? ... mr . sulu ? !

estimating planet earth one point six hours present speed .

bearing !

what is it ?

on my way ... !

mr. sulu , if you please .

you will be in good hands here .

that 's the ticket , laddie .

father ... ?

gomen nasarei . hito chigai de gozaranuka na . i 'm sorry , my son . you have mis- taken me for someone else .

i just ... have n't gotten around to it yet .

seeing my home planet from space for the first time ...

clearly , the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret . not just from you , but from my people as well . i do n't intend to let them .

perhaps it would surprise you to know that i have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child ...

perhaps , that is true .

will he live ?

prepare to transport the 'hostages ' to the ship ...

i 'm showing fresh air behind this calcite formation , captain ...

what you 're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields ...

how about a passive radiation scan ?

tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills ...

it 's nothing personal data . you have to remember these people have rejected technology . and you ...

you 're aboard the enterprise .

it is over .

it is not over .

federation support , federation procedures , federation rules ... look in the mirror , admiral ... the federation is old ... in the last twenty four months , it 's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the borg , the cardassians , the dominion ... they all smell the scent of death on the federation . that 's why you 've embraced our offer ... because it will give your dear federation new life . well , how badly do you want it , admiral ? because there are hard choices to be made now . if the enterprise gets through with news about their brave captain 's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless ba'ku , your federation politicians will waver , your federation opinion polls will open a public debate , your federation allies will want their say ... need i go on ?

take me down . let me talk to picard .

then the son ' a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do ...

with metaphasics , lifespans will be doubled ... an entire new medical science will evolve ... i understand your chief engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life ... would you take his sight away from him ?

our partners are nothing more than petty thugs .

there are six hundred people down there . we 'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions . the son ' a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings ...

this was too important for the enterprise to be on the sidelines , admiral ...

we 'd have to tag every one of them ... that would take time ... and we do n't have it . the enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the federation ...

recommendations ?

we 're about to lose communications with starfleet , captain .

i would n't be surprised if history remembers this as the riker maneuver ...

the purpose being ... ?

top level review , my ass . there 'll be no cover-up of this . not after i get ...

aye , sir .

nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey ...

ask them .

we came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation ... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life . a small group of us set off to find a new home ... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds . that was three hundred and nine years ago .

we 're coming as fast as we can ... we ca n't risk using phasers ...

can you beam him off ?

accelerated hair growth is often experienced by klingons during jak'tahla ...

did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings ?

no , sir . i have n't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since i 've been back ...

the metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux . steer clear of them , mister worf ...

i 've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos . its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down ...

augh ?

on this ship , anything can happen . and usually does .

you 're in quite a mood today .

why do n't you try sitting up ?

got a minute ? i ... need a little counseling . first time for everything . do i ... lie down ... or what ?

hmm , i should feel right at home with them ...

activating injector assembly .

regardless of how i may feel about ruby ... our fates lie along different paths . nothing can change that .

that might not be so bad ... at least for you .

but i had a little help . surgical transporter . i used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain .

he 's stable ... for now . but it would be better if we could contact ... our friends .

are you saying they wo n't help us ?

well , why did n't you just say so in the first place ?

i 'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments . if they move any closer to the brain , we could be looking at a hemorrhage .

yes ...

have you ever know a woman ? do you know what it 's like to feel her breath on your face ... her skin against yours ... flesh against flesh ?

i ... do not want this ...

contact starfleet command .

it has entered earth orbit . correction -- it is not in orbit . it is heading directly toward the surface .

i will admit ... there are times when i wish i had an emotion chip i could turn on and off .

not very well . we met shortly after the enterprise-e was commissioned . i found her to be a most ... promising officer .

their com system must still be down .

one minute to warp threshold ...

entering the upper ionospere ...

then we 'll just have to assume it 's still there ...

it 'll have to wait . come on .

we need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours ... there must be some design schematics ... blueprints ...

main bus ...

what about our warp signature ? it has to be strong enough for them to detect .

are we on schedule ? the vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours .

i 'm an old friend of cochrane 's ... i wanted to see how he was doing .

huh .

beautiful city . used to be , anyway . i did n't think anyone still lived there .

that 's impossible .

i do n't care if you 're from france or venus ... just take me with you .

it 's the future , is n't it ? just like you told scrimm . i knew you were n't from around here .

i have to ...

i am not a thief ...

or ... ?

okay , let 's hear it . i 'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house .

were the two of you ... involved ?

are you always sucha good judge of character ?

you 're not someone who lies very easily ... so it 's obvious when you do ... at least to me .

i can try .

i 'm very sorry .

cochrane ?

thank god this plate was already fixed .

yes , he is .

track their weapons fire .

incoming transmission from starfleet command . admiral hayes .

phasers are off-line ... we have two quantum torpedoes left . but the computer targeting system has been destroyed .

then make it so . have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex ?

ca n't tell . long-range bio- sensors are off-line .

we 're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex ...

and commander , whatever you do ... do < u > not < /u > vomit in your exo-suit . it would be ... unpleasant .

they 're re-routing the deflector power conduits ...

all right ... we 've lost control of eight decks ... three cargo bays ... one shuttlebay .

we just lost main power ... and we 've got class-three alerts all over the ship . i 'm not sure what 's --

target ...

mr. president we can not allow federation citizens to be abducted .

bet you wish you 'd stood in bed ...

it 's the viridium patch spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard gorkon 's ship .

no !

what the hell 's going on ?

ah . i believe you also consumed romulan ale at the officers ' mess on the night of question , doctor ?

doctor mccoy , what is your current medical status ?

that 's a comfort ...

yes ...

would you care to go topside ?

then all we 've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we 're close enough to record it , we 're ashes ...

uhura , monitor !

of course not . anyway , somebody up there wants you out of the way .

captain , our shields -- !

aye , sir .

thank you . lieutenant , one quarter impulse power ...

surely not .

close enough to beam down ?

can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness ? would that constitute a joke ?

i 've been dead before . uhura , raise excelsior . she ought to have the co-ordinates .

what peace conference ?

where ?

far be it for me to dispute my first officer . starfleet has always -

nothing , captain . if they 're here , they 're rigger for silent running .

we surrender .

this is the starship enterprise , captain james kirk commanding .

but it was when you tried to persuade me the captain was guilty that i should have understood .

i 'm having the garbage searched . if my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers ' necks like tiberian bats . they could n't make their escape without them ; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see ; no - they 're here . somewhere .

even logic must give way to physics . gravity had n't been restored by the time they escaped . without their boots they would not have stayed on the klingon transporter pads .

any progress ?

i believe i am .

mr. scott , you forget yourself . please accompany me .

i do n't think starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament .

i assume command of this ship as of 0130 hours . uhura , send to starfleet hq . explain precisely what has taken place , and request instructions .

indefinitely .

i know .

is that your final answer ?

no .

i am in a room with lights .

understood . keep on it . i need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat . give me options .

when was he ... created ?

sir , allow me to go . you are needed here .

we are losing dorsal shields .

commander riker , evasive maneuvers !

yes , sir . the rift effects all long-range communications .

he would deny a `` human '' connection is possible . he considers himself entirely reman .

port thrusters , sir . would you like me to drive ?

a weapon .

a bit less florid , data .

i can see that .

the closest signature is two kilometers to the west ... that direction , sir .

you do not look like me .

dr. soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions .

since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself , it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on kolarus iii .

why is it moving ?

sir , the strongest sense i had was that he 's more than urious about you . he very much wants to know you . the same way you want to know him .

may i have this dance ?

can you feel my hands ... are they real ? can you feel my lips , my loins ?

i 'm afraid that drink will have to wait , captain .

captain picard , commander donatra of the warbird valdore . might we be of assistance ?

number one . you have the bridge .

geordi ... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals . they do n't know our procedures so just ... open the doors .

on screen .

aye , sir .

he thinks he knows exactly what i 'm going to do .

there 's something else . i was reviewing the sensor logs .

there 'll be another after me . and another after that . you 'll find we 're a resilient species .

worf , prepare a full phaser spread , zero elevation . all banks on my mark . scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes .

who was it ?

agreed .

and the romulans invade .

oh boy . destroy humanity and the federation is crippled .

the praetor 's power has always been the romulan fleet . they must be behind him .

acknowledged ... ... i 'll talk to data .

where we will all honor the betazoid traditions . no cold feet , or any other parts of our anatomy . now , if youll excuse me . ill be in the gym .

i do n't know .

he is what his life has made him !

we are .

think about what you 're doing , shinzon . are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons ?

all of this so you could capture me ?

why am i here ?

so i 'm not as tall as you expected ?

for thousands of years the romulan senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet ... but the time has come for us to live as equals .

our eyes reflect our lives , do n't they ? yours are so confident .

yes .

i have dissolved the senate .

i want to end the centuries of mistrust . i want to be your ally , not your enemy . as a first step i propose we eliminate the neutral zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas .

and you 're not as we imagined you .

disruptors are off-line , sir .

do n't forget our mission , shinzon . we should act . now . time is running out .

and when i return ... you and i shall have a little talk about showing proper respect !

the enterprise is immaterial ! they wo n't make it back to federation space .

silence , romulan !

they 're holding position .

no , we can handle this .

do n't you think you should call a backup ?

benny , there 's nothing there .

i do n't want to scare them away .

do you have a good map of death valley ?

it 's still the full price .

what can i do for you folks ?

thank you .

it is beautiful .

where 's that ?

no deal .

you can change a directive , george . you 've done it before . listen to me . he 's going somewhere in death valley . lathrop wells was never anything but a bus stop . east is the nuclear site . there are no roads in there . she was teaching him to hitchhike . i 'm telling you . we block the four roads into death valley and we got him .

the extraterrestrial now looks like this .

we 've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public , it 's been decided not to expand the search at this time .

we 'll need a lot of help , george . you could hide an army up here .

get a highway patrol unit over there .

i do n't know . someplace called elmo 's . look , i just wanted to tell you that i 'm all right and i 'm on my way home .

oh , wow ... i 'll tell you what . when the baby is born , we 'll go out in my back yard and wave to you .

yes .

if i ever run into that guy , i 'm going to kick his ass .

i understand . thank you .

nothing .

we 'll get a ride in the morning .

why do n't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late ?

we 're too far away to walk . do n't you understand ?

no one 's traveling in this weather .

where did you learn that ?

i told you goodbye . why are you here ?

you should n't drink so much of that stuff . it 's bad for you .

yes .

it 's bad .

oh , that 's terrible . i 'm sorry . was he a good friend ?

you thought we were a different planet ? !

when do i get to lathrop wells ?

yes .

but i speak english .

the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells ...

that 's not much time . i 'll just slow you down . i have to sleep . i 'm very tired . and i have to wash and eat . you do n't ...

yes .

my ... ... car will take me ... ... up there ... home .

you did n't even see it .

what 's the matter ?

yes .

up there ... i ... eh ... ca n't explain ... but that 's the only place you could be from .

are you from up there ? space ?

that 's a big help . where are you from ?

i am jenny haydn .

no gas ... car dead . we need gas . i do n't want to get shot for running out of gas .

no gas .

x ...

what ?

help me ! ! !

call the police ! !

help me ! !

do n't worry . i 'll be all right .

the five-fifty . we already passed it . but it 'll take him way out of his way .

fly .

i know . she bought him a ticket for lathrop wells and put him on the bus . he did n't stay on though and they drove off together .

they 're gon na let some local cop blow him away .

listen to this . a woman was kidnapped in eau claire this morning . when a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish ' ...

we better get it into the box . come on ...

i know what i saw . i 've seen him enough times .

judy , that 's stupid .

all the roads into death valley are blocked . we 'd like to talk to you .

i do n't want to hurt anybody . i just want to go home .

okay cash ! logical . here 's everything i have on me , what do you say ? how about a rolex ?

i saw you play , man . you were good . like a fucking freight train i remember saying . so what happened , injuries or what ?

a star is born .

yeah , right .

i live for the moment .

i made my choice , lenny .

yeah ... he figured out what to do all right .

how did it happen ? what was iris doing riding around with jeriko wearing a wire ?

oh god , lenny . i was trying to keep you out of this .

tell me .

i 'm already hurting .

i just want to see what we 're like together through your eyes .

talk to me about costs , here .

that 's right . clips . look , i want you to know what we 're talking about here . this is n't like tv only better . this is life . it 's a piece of somebody 's life . pure and uncut , straight from the cerebral cortex . you 're there . you 're doing it , seeing it , hearing it ... feeling it .

that 's right .

this dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her , right ? but faith knows me from you , right , so she comes up to me and says , 'hey max why you following me ? ' i say , ' i 'll buy you a drink and explain . ' and she says ...

naawww .

that 's pretty much the way it happened .

jesus !

smoke . rumors . i 've heard stuff about a death squad . a group a guys loyal to the hardline school . guys that 've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks , suspending cops right and left , tying their hands ... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people 're squealing save us , save us , do something you fucking morons , crime is totally out of control .

you may be a little overdressed for this party . yo , tick ! it 's lenny . open up !

come on , lenny . you used to be good at this stuff . play it down . what 's the perp doing ?

she never gave me a tape .

what else you got ?

yeah , but how 'd it get to you ?

sorry .

faith , can i talk to you a second ?

are n't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter ?

see you downtown .

are we under arrest ?

then we 'll be right where we are now .

i still got one ace to play . tran 's got what i want ... and i 've got what he wants ...

no , it 's not .

okay , we got ta get over there . can you borrow a dress from cecile or something --

yeah . you gave up your hot tub tape to save me . that 's real progress for you .

it 's okay , lenny they 'd never get here in time anyway .

it 's in my case . okay ? i 'm going to open my case ...

lenny , have you lost it completely ?

i 'm sorry about getting on your case earlier . i just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper , and i -- anyway . i 'm sorry .

because it had to look random . not connected to anything or anyone . but then why give the rape to me ?

but that does n't add , does it .

it 's not your fault .

go to the sunset sheraton . right now ! just go ! go !

i have crawled through the gutter ... through every wrinkle in the human brain .

you 're some piece of work , you know that . just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl , and somehow you never let it touch you . i mean , between vice and this so- called occupation you 're in now , you must 've seen it all .

you 'll see .

destiny ? you living in a perfume commercial ? she 's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride .

sure , lenny . the only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love .

begging ? groveling ? any pathetic behavior at all ? will that help ? faith 's there tonight , and i 've got to talk to her .

yeah . i do n't see a way out of it .

no , wrong ... i sell experiences . sex is only part of it .

driving mr. lenny .

come on , mace . this is gon na be a big night . ca n't you feel it ? the energy in the air ? there 's money to be made , dreams to sell .

they jerked my wheels , d'you believe it ? i mean it 's outrageous , the computer errors the banks are making lately . have you noticed ?

right . that explains it .

where were you mom ? did you meet a guy ?

fine . do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains ? the gangbangers 'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground . and when the fires start the street cops 'll be capping off at anything that moves . it 'll be all- out war and you know it .

those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks .

problem is , lenny knows everybody .

maybe he just figures lenny will appreciate what he 's created . it 's the dark end of the street , lenny . how do you like it now ?

yeah .

what ?

and it 's getting dark . i 'm not going to run this into the night . eddie , we 're walking in . everything covered ?

i 'm on my way .

you 're thinking ... ?

i know how the feds like to sit on information . i got something in the car to show you .

that 's right , jan .

excuse me , a salesman gets done in his car and you call the fbi ?

jesus .

what kind ?

another what ?

sorry to interrupt you , sir , but i thought you 'd like to know .

we did n't know speck was a serial , the police did n't know , his wife did n't know -- so how did the killer know ?

there 's a killer out there -- we know who he is . he could be stalking now .

i was visiting an old college friend .

why did you go to chicago ?

that gasbag . i can imagine what he said . i 'm not ashamed to admit that most of what i know about criminal profiling started with richard low . i have also , over the years , i admit , taken credit for many of his accomplishments . he was the most brilliant law enforcement individual i ever met .

what i do requires confidentiality .

this time , sir , if i may be so bold , would it be possible to set up my equipment outside ciiac , perhaps in military housing at quantico ? i did n't get along very well with the other members of the division . we thought differently .

he got away . i had him . he got away .

jaime --

tom , you okay ?

i met with richard low . these are names of missing persons he has flagged . i 'm double-checking every case , but i do n't want to be too obvious about it . i marked the ones i 'd like you to work on .

this feels like something out of a spy novel .

you want to get him ? find something he wants . get him to come to you .

what 's that ?

he 's called a couple times .

`` intra-agency fraternizing . ''

sex .

chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims : `` i went live last month . ''

you want to have dinner ?

yes i do .

some kids found you in a garbage dump .

turn around . stretch your arms over the seat .

okay , i 'll unhook you . no weapon .

of course he does . now get the key , get these things off me . unhook me .

if you wo n't do it for me , do it for your cousin , nadine , right ? the girl in the pink sweater .

of course not . they 're possibles . i 've checked them against bureau records , check them against your file . how did you get it ?

the file , however , was kept open after your death . npe disappearances , no plausible explanation , were sometimes filed there , deleted if the bodies were found .

he 's moved on to tv .

agent mackelway ?

who are you ?

[ i do n't think so . we want the same thing . see ya . ]

i 've located the suspect zero file . did you know there was one ? koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation .

i do n't think you understand .

speck is dead .

koessler ?

i like working for the bureau , sir . i like catching bad guys . it 's all i care about .

`` attitude adjustment issues '' -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean ?

i screwed up twice , sir .

you want to `` profile '' me ? find out what makes me `` tick '' ? write about me , go on a talk show , give me a nickname ?

i 'm agent thomas mackelway , fbi . there is no way you will escape . assistant deputy director richard low is en route with another agent . you may know low by another name . you may know him by the name murman . i am lionheart .

do you realize that i 've been waiting for that call for six months and i cut her off ?

moving here from new york was much more of an adjustment than this .

you 've been through worse .

thank you , nikki .

probably a little longer than that , but , whatever .

it 's been six months and i 'm just starting to get over it .

i thought i was going to die .

you too ?

how was it hard ?

... and boy does it hurt when they ask .

no .

my pleasure .

the poor thing . i 'll make some coffee .

did you get it ?

i 'm a `` dorothy '' .

can i get you something else ? i mean , you should n't leave without getting something for free .

on the table .

hi . sorry about that .

hi , mike ?

i 'll have to come see you sometime .

i would love to see you again sometime .

you said there are advantages to being single . i want to know what the advantages are .

sure .

you miss the pain ?

how did you get over it ? i mean how long 'til it stopped hurting ?

oh boy .

you want to talk about it ?

him ?

i just tested for one ...

there 's the rub .

darwinism at its best .

bud .

kinda money , huh ?

so , if the party starts at eight , why are we first going to a bar at ten ?

looks like we 're in a dead heat after one hole . this is turning into quite a rivalry .

i do n't know . eight or nine .

there 's just something about being `` goofy '' . any other disney character would be fine . there 's just this stigma associated with the character .

hey man , do n't sweat it .

she did n't like me ... i made a fool of myself ...

who threw this party , anyway ?

... he 's derivative ...

what 's he do ?

... which means no one will get there 'til ten .

make someone bleed .

wow , i guess you were home ...

hi , nikki . mike . i do n't think this is working out . i think you 're great , but maybe we should just take some time off from each other . it 's not you , really . it 's me . it 's only been six months ...

hi , nikki . this is mike again . could you just call me when you get in ? i 'll be up for awhile , and i 'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all ...

hi . this is nikki . leave a message .

you were good . did you see how she was vibing you ?

i do n't know . it was kind of a dick move if you ask me .

what ? that was the best part of the old game .

baby , she 's the one who should be thinking about you . sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight . trust me , mikey , you 're better off .

what ? ! ?

... a day ...

i do n't know . the whole judy garland thing kind of turned me on . does that makes me some kind of fag ?

please , tee . i have to use the phone . sorry , man .

it 's just that i 've been out of the game so long . trent , i was with her for six years . that 's before aids . i 'm scared . i do n't know how to talk to them , i do n't know ...

whatever . we 'll see . daddy 's gon na get her to bring a friend . we 'll both get one . i do n't care if i 'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends .

you think so ?

i know she 's coming back .

okay , tee 's the asshole , but mikey 's the big winner .

i do n't know , what ? thirty , forty maybe .

double down .

that 's where we make our scene .

when ?

... oh , who would jack your fuckin k- car ? he 's right , sue . you do n't need no gat .

laugh all you want , but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who 's ready to party .

... yeah . but two 's enough not to look anxious ...

... i used to wait two days . now everyone waits two days . three days is kinda money now , do n't you think ?

now when you talk to her , i do n't want you to be the guy in the pg-13 movie that everyone 's pulling for . i want you to be the guy in the rated r movie who you 're not sure if you like .

... you 're so fuckin mmmoney .

... and fangs ... and you 're like `` i do n't know what to do . how do i kill this bunny ? `` ...

... shivering ...

you are so money , and you do n't even know it ...

it 's on .

damn . now i got ta go in early .

see , baby ?

what a surprise ...

... is he brown ?

beautiful . what time are you off ... ... christy ?

... one fifty-nine , two minutes .

what do you wish me to do ?

barzini .

what 's the matter , carlo ?

i want somebody very good , very safe to plant that gun . i do n't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand .

okay , now you can move your men into the mall , replace tessio 's people . mike , tomorrow you take a couple of clemenza 's people and go to luca 's apartment and wait for him to show . that crazy bastard might be going after sollozzo right now if he 's heard the news .

maybe three , four times . i always asked freddie if he wanted another bodyguard , but he said no . things have been so smooth the last ten years ...

you think we 'll go for that last place ?

good for ten men ...

sure .

what percentages for my family ?

i 'm not rich anymore , godfather , and ... my career , i 'm almost washed up ...

he was the one behind sollozzo ?

what miracles you do for strangers .

there is nothing there . not anymore .

i know .

don tommassino .

no , she 's going home to her family . she 'll join me in a few weeks ...

pop , they hit us and we hit them back .

what about that tattaglias ? what will they do about bruno ?

ok , we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead . but tom , i want you to stay inside the mall . you too , mike , no chances . tessio , you hold your people in reserve , but have them nosing around the city . the hospital is yours ; i want it tight , fool-proof , 24 hours a day .

what about luca ? sollozzo did n't seem worried about luca . that worries me .

the cops have it locked in and i got my people there visiting pop all the time . what about the hit list .

is the hospital covered ?

listen tom , i let my cab go ; can i come in to call another one ?

the don was slipping ; in the old days i could never have gotten to him . now he 's dead , nothing can bring him back . talk to sonny , talk to the caporegimes , clemenza and tessio ... it 's good business .

okay my kraut-mick friend , johnny will never get that part because i hate that pinko punk and i 'm going to run him out of the movies . and i 'll tell you why . he ruined one of woltz brothers ' most valuable proteges . for five years i had this girl under training ; singing lessons ! acting lessons ! dancing lessons ! we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars -- i was going to make her a star . i 'll be even more frank , just to show you that i 'm not a hard-hearted man , that it was n't all dollars and cents . that girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass i 've ever ad and i 've had them all over the world . then johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off . she threw it all away to make me look ridiculous . a man in my position can not afford to be made to look ridiculous !

let me think about it , o.k . ?

oh michael .

i do n't think so either . i better go .

michael ...

once upon a time , about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father 's olive oil business . they had al capone send some men in from chicago to kill my father , and they almost did .

i 've never seen anything like it .

oh your father just had too many visitors . it interfered with the hospital service . the police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago . but do n't worry . i look in on him .

they want me to go to the conference with sollozzo . set up the meeting for two days from now . sonny , get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held . insist it has to be a public place : a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour . so i 'll feel safe . they 'll check me when i meet them so i wo n't be able to carry a weapon ; but clemenza , figure out a way to have one planted there for me . then i 'll kill them both .

the turk wants to talk ! the nerve of that son of a bitch ! after he craps out last night he wants a meet .

sonny ... sonny -- jesus christ , i 'm down at the hospital . i came down late . there 's no one here . none of tessio 's people -- no detectives , no one . the old man is completely unprotected .

then wait , sonny . talk to pop .

maybe .

you straightened my brother out ?

you think i scam ?

mike , good to see you . got everything you want ?

bastard ! is n't it great , tom ? i found it in naples . i bargained for about two weeks .

i had to promise , capital p , never to take it off -- otherwise i 'd give it to you .

is that good ?

fausto and i -- we took the boat out , we were fishing , and then it was dawn and we 'd caught absolutely nothing .

did you forget where i live ? it 's four o'clock .

how do you do .

no , no , it 's not a threat , i 've explained all of that .

you see , particularly with the marge problem , you can just blame me .

really ? to italy ?

i 'm thinking of giving up the sax , what do you think about drums ?

do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit ?

that 's good .

i do n't think so , tom . you ca n't stay on here without money . it 's time we all moved on . besides i 'm sick of mongi . especially now with everything -- i really want to move to the north . i need to check out san remo next week , find somewhere new to keep the boat . but it would be great , though , if you came with me . our last trip before you leave . there 's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style . what do you think ? a last trip ?

i was just fooling around . do n't say anything . sorry .

where do we find a carozza for the forum , or can we hire any of them -- ?

i did n't mean with you in it .

means we never shared a bath . i 'm cold . can i get in ?

do you have any brothers ?

like clark kent . now superman .

you 're breaking my ribs !

could we sail to venice ?

can you mix a martini ?

do you think you can steer this thing ?

have you done something to your hair ?

of course , he 's been very involved in his music , has n't he ? i think his theory is , you know , you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly .

we could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --

i think it might hurt her to know .

yes . what 's the detective hoping to find in san remo ?

yes it is .

i 'm well , thank you .

marge , there 's female intuition , and then there are facts --

three different people saw dickie get into freddie miles ' car . a man who wo n't identify himself because he was jumping someone else 's wife at the time saw dickie removing license plates from a red sports car . the police know about this man because he happens to be a policeman .

oh marge .

i feel as if you have n't heard anything i 've been saying to you .

the scent you 're wearing . i bought it for you , not dickie . the thing about dickie . so many things . the day he was late back from rome -- i tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl . i 'm not talking about meredith , another girl we met in a bar . he could n't be faithful for five minutes . so when he makes a promise it does n't mean what it means when you make a promise . or i do . he has so many realities , dickie , and he believes them all . he lies . he lies , that 's his ... half the time he does n't even realize .

to the manner born .

i was looking forward to seeing him .

we passed it a few blocks back , where the police were . the palazzo gioia . they do n't even know i 'm in rome and i 'm not going to incriminate dickie --

i tried again , waiting here , watching for him . instead it 's you . whenever i look for dickie i find you . what happened to your face ?

oh my god . tom .

how long 's he staying for ?

well , one day i 'm invited skiing , the next day i 'm not , one day we 're all one family , the next day he wants to be alone . you tell me .

hello marge .

no , nothing . i 'm just thinking about when tom arrived in mongi . and now look at you .

golly . who 's paying for this ?

so you found peter ...

peter smith-kingsley ? i have n't seen him in months . no , i 'm alone .

when i thought about you i was mostly hating you . where 've you been hiding ?

well , you 've spotted me and so you get the reward .

you 're such a pal to understand . it 's as if marge is here now -- i look at you and i see her face -- and i ca n't , whatever i 'm feeling towards you -- i just ca n't ...

you 're crazy ! it 's freezing out there .

i know .

everybody knows freddie miles .

the funny thing is , i 'm not randall either . i 'm logue .

my father wants me in new york . he builds boats . i 'd rather sail them . i travel under my mother 's name .

hello .

what 's your secret ?

non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private !

all'aperto ? col freddo che ha fatto ?

and do n't forget . i have the key .

or tom and peter even .

do you want me to stick around ?

i 'm fine .

you look ghastly , tom . are you okay ?

no key , huh ?

whatever you do , however terrible , however hurtful -- it all makes sense , does n't it ? inside your head . you never meet anybody who thinks they 're a bad person or that they 're cruel .

okay . marge , see you tomorrow . it 's really good to meet you .

tomorrow .

absolutely .

does he stay with you here ?

november , i thought .

i really do n't want to see anybody .

dickie greenleaf ?

nah , this 'll be fine .

no , no , please . this fare 's on me . please .

well , i hope he wins .

yes . it wo n't be long now . seventeen days .

what about the record ?

that 's very romantic . some of your fares must be interesting . see any stars , politicians , deliver any babies yet ?

you 'd be surprised how often you see the same people , get the same fare . people have patterns . they do more or less the same things every day . i can tell .

that would have been quite a coincidence .

you 're right ! now i remember ! it was after the western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late . the next day i was completely bushed . it was unbelievable .

late one night . about three . at the plaza .

the moon ?

i shut the meter off , for one thing . i knew i was n't going to get paid . then i dropped him off at the cop shop . they took him .

really ?

it 's just to the corner , mam . in broad daytime . nothing can happen . i 'll be there to protect you .

who mam ?

betsy , come over here a moment .

he happens to be missing fingers . i first noticed when --

i do n't know -- but it feels like a long time .

how long has he been there ?

maybe if you 'd try thinking once in a while , you 'd get somewhere .

kidding around ... you know , fun .

awh , come off it , pal .

... he called up the dispatcher last night . charlie mccall , our dispatcher ...

what ya gon na do with all that money , dough-boy ?

could you see anything ?

ask travis . he 's the ladies man .

20 bucks ?

you carry a piece ? you need one ?

i 'll give you the money to go . i do n't want you to take any from those guys .

do you really think i should go to the commune ?

he 's worse than an animal . jail 's too good for scum like that .

but you ca n't live like this . it 's hell . girls should live at home .

well , you want to or not ?

i understand , mister . it means something , really .

but that one night ?

fuck it ! fuck it ! fuck it ! fuck it ! fuck it ! fuck it ! fuck it !

listen ...

a girl needs protection .

hello .

have you tried the telephone ?

there must be something ...

well then check back tomorrow .

so i hear .

also clean .

you want to work uptown nights ?

there 's porno theatres for that .

no trouble with the hack bureau ?

is it hard to get to be a secret service man ?

who ?

o.k. , cowboy .

anything you say , officer .

like do anything , you know .

i know .

yeah ?

hey wizard .

just come and get me , sir . i 'm tired .

no .

what 's that ? mason ?

yes . to wish someone a prosperous jouey .

wait . where 're you going ?

motor oil ?

john mason . ' do n't be shocked . i do n't have much time . please listen carefully ... .

you suppose ?

and i love you , pete !

okay . what 's the second thing ?

but if you only went to one meeting , why does anyone care ? besides , why should it even matter if you were a communist ?

this luke was a pretty good guy , was n't he ?

i 'm sure a lot of people down in l.a. are worried sick about you .

besides , daddy 's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working .

i 'm afraid not . he looked right at your picture without batting an eye . but it 's probably temporary . he got all the way to lawson , so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head . i 'm sure it 'll all come back to him . it just takes a catalyst .

well ... everything . it started coming back a couple of days ago . i remember everything now .

oh . okay .

no kidding .

huh . that was nice of me .

no , they 're not . i 'd say your investment was paying dividends .

have you got a cigarette ?

i 'm fine . really .

you ... do n't remember , but yes , ever since i was a little girl .

well ... where can we go ?

me too .

i 've seen you before . your picture ...

good . good . now , i hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the `` bread instead of bullets club '' of the university of california , los angeles , dated october 11 , 1935. a copy of this paper is before you , mr. appleton . do you recognize it ?

i 'm sorry , sir , i have no intention of making light of this committee . and i have no intention of incurring your wrath , mr. chairman . i have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath . they 've sent me letters from jail .

i 'll do my best , mr. chairman .

do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the united states house of representatives will be the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help you god ?

`` it 's a wonderful life ? ''

you ever been in this town before , to your knowledge ?

the days of the storefront grocery are numbered . i plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket .

we 're gon na try . place needs a lot of work .

thanks .

luke , you probably do n't remember me , roscoe fitts , i 'm the grocer here in town .

jesus ...

luke ... what time is it ?

ernie .

forty-two was a lean year around here . the war had just started ... you were gone less than a month ... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as i recall . not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket , and a chicken 's as good as money if you ask me . at that time , it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures .

ah .

nine and-a-half years ...

too bad . he says i 'm a communist .

it 's possible . i just do n't remember .

i do n't remember . i guess so . smells like it . tastes like it .

any idea how you got here , son ?

even if we could , and the move did n't kill him , there 'd be very little we could do there that we ca n't do here . i 'm sorry .

do n't smell nothin ' . he must not be dead in here .

thank me publicly ? for what ? for ruining this woman 's life ?

peter , i 'm an agent . i buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you . that 's what i do . you 're a writer . you write pictures . that 's what you do . and trust me , you 'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning .

that 's the one , `` ashes to ashes . '' i think it 's great . but it 'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head . you ca n't work until you 're cleared -- and believe me , starting right now , i 'm gon na do everything i can to make that happen .

they do n't want you to testify because you 're not a big enough fish for them . they just do n't want you writing pictures for now . that 's all .

oh dear , yes . you were an excellent student , before all that clarinet nonsense . you loved chopin . you used to call it `` heaven music . '' `` teach me some heaven music , '' you used to say .

when was that ?

i thought you ...

i 'm ... i 'm not luke . luke is dead . he died in the war . he 's not coming back , and i 'm not him . i do n't even belong here . this whole thing started out as an accident , and that 's all it is . an accident .

thanks .

i was n't alone . was n't frankie ruskin directing the picture you 're in ?

got any money ?

you hungry , son ?

i suppose . thanks .

who ?

now that you remember who you are , were you planning on telling anyone your true identity ?

yes .

no , that 's all right , i do n't mind . i came up here for two reasons . to begin with , i was bored with my job in san francisco . i was teaching at a private school there ... well , you know , you probably went to one yourself .

because she was afraid .

lydia liked me , you see . that was the strange part of it . in fact , now that i 'm no longer a threat , we 're very good friends .

different ?

it gets a little chilly here at night sometimes . especially if you 're over near the bay .

would you like some brandy ?

miss daniels ? is that you ?

yes , i know . did something unexpected crop up ?

well , i 'd really hope to rent it for ...

oh , hi ! did you find her all right ?

actually , it 's none of my business .

it 's a lovely garden .

in a democracy , cathy , everyone is entitled to a fair trial . your brother 's practice ...

do n't you like us ?

could i have a puff ?

did you put the cover on that cage , mom ?

it 's alice , ai n't it ?

the little brenner girl ?

and the white house ?

yes ?

see where i 'm pointing ?

where ?

right across the bay there .

yep .

morning .

the crow is a permanent resident throughout its range . in fact , during our christmas count , we recorded ...

we 'll make our own fog .

you cut yourself outside , miss ?

are you finished here , sebastian ?

i started to say ... inside ...

what do we have to know , mother ? we 're all together , we all love each other , we all need each other . what else is there ? mother , i want us to stay alive !

i 'm frightened , terribly frightened . i ... i do n't know what 's out there , mitch .

oh , my god , look at her !

i do n't know when . we 'll see what ...

well ... well , is everyone all right ?

yes ?

it 's none of my business , of course , but when you bring a girl like that to ...

she is the one who jumped into that fountain in rome last summer , is n't she ?

you 'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print . she 's always mentioned in the columns , mitch .

in a bird shop .

yes , lovebirds . we could n't let you ...

i wish i were stronger . do you think she 's all right ? do you think she 's safe at the school ?

and if you do n't ?

then he saw .

he was calling from the farm , mrs. brenner .

where 's mitch ?

then you knew mitch in san francisco , is that right ?

no , you got quite a mess here , i 'll admit that . maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney seems a little pointless , though . freak accident like this would n't happen again in a million years . you want some help cleaning up ?

these birds were ...

yes , but the curtains were drawn .

he 's not home .

i ... i do n't think so . if we get through town , i think we 'll be all right .

i do n't want to be safe . i want to be with you .

even the birds sitting out there . it does look very much the same , mitch . this could be last week .

i keep thinking of annie .

it makes you feel as if they 're ... they 're waiting or ... resting ... or ... .

it 's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday , is n't it ? it 's so beautiful and still now . i think i 've got it all figured out , by the way .

i think i should , do n't you ?

do you want some mustard with this ?

nothing . i go to bird shops on fridays .

well ... i have to get to work tomorrow morning , for one thing .

because it seemed stupid and foolish .

so you did n't go to school together .

the truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd ...

seven o'clock then .

certainly , but ...

after all , you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds .

it 's still bleeding a little . here , let me put this on .

did you ! imagine that ! how long will you be staying ?

yes .

no , san francisco . what are you ... ?

just some peroxide . i want to clean out the cut .

i did n't break that window !

we met in court .

i was merely drawing a parallel , miss daniels .

are you sure you would n't like to see a canary instead ? we have some very nice canaries this week .

well , we ca n't just let them fly around the shop , you know .

no , sir , those are ... redbirds .

what ?

do you have any lovebirds ?

and what ? vultures ? hawks ? eagles ?

have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest ?

i do n't know why .

they 're different , daddy . thank you . i think these were crows . yes , hundreds of them . yes , they attacked the children , attacked them . daddy , a little girl was sent to the hospital in santa rosa . well , all right , but you act as if i 'm ... all right , all right . no , i ca n't come home now . i just ca n't , daddy . how is it there ? i mean ... are there birds ? in the sky ? but no trouble . well , i hope ... i do n't know when . i simply ca n't leave now . tell mother not to worry . all right , daddy , good-by .

look , mitch , even if this is true , even if all the birds ...

no one ever said you were , mitch .

actually , those gulls must have been after the fish .

which gulls , mr. sholes ? there are several varieties .

were the santa rosa police at your school today ? are you coming ?

good .

of course -- it 's the soul of the business -- the pay --

dr. macfarlane said i should pay you --

ma'am , is you 'll allow me , i 'd like to give you cause for courage -- dr. macfarlane is a great man -- i think he 's the greatest man in medicine . god would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for georgina 's cure .

-- pain -- and shock . she 's brave enough , but i do n't know about myself . now that it seems so close , i wonder if i dare trust my child into any but god 's hands . maybe he knows best .

i 'm only a student .

and back with macfarlane and all that he stands for the next day .

it 's a gift to my people -- and i see macfarlane and gray -- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and i would have you away from them and safe out of the torment. --

listen to me , fettes , i 'm one part befuddled with drink , one part over-heels in love with macfarlane , and one part fey . you 're a lowlander , fettes , and you have no way of knowing what we highlanders call the second sight .

macfarlane

if he were only that . the man 's evil himself . some day you 'll know him as macfarlane knows him -- for macfarlane he was to knox as you are to him . that brought him close to gray , he roistered with him and drank with him . aye , and gray even brought him to my door and my love . there is all that between them and more -- burke and hare and knox --

what ?

but , i did n't ask him to kill .

i do n't know that -- neither do you . this subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --

this girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the highlands .

yes , i suppose so .

but i -- well , you see , sir , i met mrs. marsh and told her .

you 're a man of the world , fettes , you would n't hold me to promise given in drink .

not if i have to be party to things like that , dr. macfarlane .

what the devil do you mean ? you have your lodgings , a certain stipend -- i thought i had arranged everything for you --

i wanted to see the white horse --

i am not at the school anymore . i left last night .

i ca n't .

an old acquaintance , eh ?

beg -- beg of you ! you crawling graveyard rat !

it would n't be half so much fun for me . toddy , as to have you come here and beg --

the resurrection business ? that may end sooner than you think . new laws may come .

i ca n't understand your hurt to me -- but i must cut you out .

gray , i must rid myself of you -- you 've become a cancer -- a malignant , evil cancer -- rotting my mind .

you are not to set foot in here again , gray , for business or any other reason . and you 're going out now !

i have no wish for a rope cravat . i 've never liked the smell of hemp , so i 'll bid you good night , doctor macfarlane .

the same . look here , gray --

i 'll not do it , gray .

you 're a teacher , eh ? maybe you 're afraid to be a doctor , toddy .

you and i should work together .

give me money or i 'll tell the police you murder the `` subjects . ''

you say you 've come here on your own account ? no one knows you are here ?

she would if she could .

but , doctor , surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --

it comes at intervals . they used to be months apart -- but they 've been growing more frequent -- much more frequent .

nearly a year .

you 're not going to gray .

you can get out .

aye . he 's a good lad . that 's why i ask you , macfarlane .

you think i 'm crazy .

`` down ? '' wait , do n't tell me .

we wo n't .

what 's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace . and i 'll be seeing her again soon . only what will i say ? that i was too stupid to find the guy who killed her ? that he 's down here laughing ?

you lied at my trial .

you 're him ! you 're corvis ! we fried your ass . you 're dead , man !

fuck . me .

because you need to understand . and you need ... to be careful .

you killed that cop dutton .

i know everything about your sister . i 'll prove it to you .

good for you . you do know something .

you know .

anything wrong ?

i 'm never going back in that house again . get away .

what is it ?

i talked to most of them this morning ... they were all very curious about the meeting .

i 'm afraid i ca n't offer you any real protection . i have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy .

bobby -- i think it would be better if we did n't see quite so much of mr. carpenter

bet he is , mom . bet he 's out looking for that space man .

go to the movies .

i 'll tell you , bobby -- i 've been away for a long time . very far away .

bobby -- who 's the greatest man in america today ?

their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty .

i 'm afraid my people have n't . i 'm very sorry -- i wish it were otherwise .

sit down , mr. harley .

you wait and see . you 're going to marry a big hero !

why not ? somebody 's got to get rid of him .

important ? of course it 's important . the point is we can do something about it .

the picture starts at eight-fifty .

it was a wonderful day .

no -- that is a power reserved to the almighty spirit .

you mean he has the power of life and death ?

i was .

`` klaatu barada nikto . ''

you see -- the electricity 's been neutralized -- all over the world .

why not ?

what is it you want ?

i -- i was just going to lunch .

goodnight , mr. carpenter .

get going , will you , brady -- before i get mad !

people get hysterical enough , they do anything . look , mr. carpenter -- if you ca n't identify yourself , i got to send you over to the army .

your name 's carpenter -- that right ? any identification , mr. carpenter ? driver 's license -- social security number ?

we do n't ride with vampires .

they would n't be out in the daytime .

you better get a garlic t-shirt , buddy .

this is n't a comic book store , right . it 's a bakery .

death to all vampires !

you know what ? you 're absolutely right .

hey , take it easy .

we were gon na grab some food .

we still going ?

with him ?

for a ride .

your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em !

what ?

his fingernails are longer , but he always has bad breath .

i 'll take you there .

i told max eight o'clock .

lucy , you 're the only woman i ever knew did n't improve her situation by getting divorced .

lots more where he came from .

... and stay outta here .

promise me you 'll keep it that way . you 're not like the others , laddie . you 're like me . i can still remember , too .

no . just you .

i had the dream again about < u > them < /u > .

okay .

i get off in another twenty minutes . i thought maybe we 'd all get a bite together .

oh , no , you wo n't .

-- i 'm not talking about max ! to hell with max !

where 's michael ?

sorry , mom . it was a mistake . i thought i saw something out the window . i was reading this horror comic and i guess i go a little carried away ...

can we go now , huh ? lucy maybe later . grandpa 's expecting us .

mom , there 's an amusement park right on the beach !

ocean air !

we 're getting close ...

it 's you i was after all along , lucy . to be our day time guardian . i knew if we could bring sam and michael into the faimly , there 'd be no way you could say no .

is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner ?

do i look that needy ?

you 've got a generous nature . i like that in a person . my name is max .

because i love you ...

okay .

let 's go see them .

i would n't have given my mom such a hard time about moving here if i 'd known i was going to meet you .

what 's the matter ?

no ! we ca n't tell mom ! please , sam . do n't tell her .

what did you to do him , michael ? why did he bite you ?

you have such a great personality , michael . you should open your own charm school .

hey , sam , we 're flat broke .

let 's load 'em .

all right ... box of dynamite ... box of thermite ... three shotguns ... box of flares ... two flare guns ... thirty cans gasoline ... and a case of alcohol .

screw it , i 'm going up anyway .

how long were you with the dog ? alone , i mean ?

what was he doing in the rec room ?

if the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- i 'm sending you and doc up to macmurdo ...

could n't make much of it myself .

well , who the hell you think wants to get in there with you ?

what you doin ' ?

i do n't know who to trust .

do n't get near 'em . the plants ! they 're alive . those things can imitate anything ...

ai n't it there ?

was dark ... find a light ...

look , i have n't been near that ... that refrigerator .

you catch anything he was saying ?

clark , you want me to come in after you ? !

maybe we should try and fix the radio ... try and get some help .

neither will we .

smart s.o.b . he put it together piece by piece .

what for ?

palmer , you and copper tie everyone down . real tight .

but ...

childs , you got the torch ? you get your ass in here ! !

did n't think you 'd use that fibrillator on norris if you were one of them .

my god , what in hell happened here ?

a couple of hours .

... guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us .

looks good .

could anyone have gotten it from you ?

he 's dead .

tie up clark , too .

i 'm sure a lot of you already know .

we going to make it ?

sanchez ... ? hey , who ...

copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight .

position , my ass ...

get back ! !

we 're going to draw a little bit of everybody 's blood .

it 's the generator i think ! no power .

macready , that you ?

what 's happened ? !

you know damn well what we both make of it .

so what do you make of it ?

macready ... ?

how can they just go back to work as if nothing happened ?

i will ...

vox ?

machines ?

oh , shut up .

yes .

it was meant to .

i 'm used to that .

and if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time ?

do you know where they live ?

i could have a hundred morlocks here in thirty seconds .

and who are you , alexander ? who are you to question thousands of years of evolution ? this is the world now . i am fact .

you came underground when the world was ending above . and you evolved . some into the morlocks and others --

ahhh ... i 'm afraid i 've got a prior commitment .

i was getting to that ... the moon has reached the gravitational roche limit , 7,300 miles above the surface of the earth . this has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances . it might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at grand central station , madison square garden --

what 's happening to the moon ? !

alex ... people are staring .

all right ...

i know it 's not a diamond but --

i mean ... well ... affection .

what ? yes -- orion -- good fortune -- sailors .

... orion 's belt , pointing to the earth . you see it over the rocks there ? sailors consider that an omen of good fortune ; the hunter watching over them on their travels ... are you listening to me , alex ?

you 're dying here . do n't you see that ? !

i ca n't leave when i 'm so close .

what is it ?

it was n't your fault , alex .

oh ?

the most able inventor i know and you ca n't tie a simple four-in- hand .

in the future , we 'll be better .

i do n't understand .

mara ... ?

alexander , take my son away . take him back to your time . will you do that ?

i could ...

or mud carriers .

yes .

why would you do that ?

allowed me to travel from my time to yours .

some . but i mean we are n't all so ... handsome .

all right , mrs. watchit . you can go .

with respect , sir , would we have the telegraph without fantasy ? would we have radium and x-rays without someone first dreaming we could ?

sir --

well ... perhaps i have `` deviated '' the tiniest bit .

alexander , i know you 're trying to help . but they do n't come back .

good morning , alexander . feeling up to some work ?

we had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago . his name was moren . do you know him ?

now you are upsetting my fowl . please go .

dean fulton ...

i am . are you a climber ?

what 's it like where you come from ?

sir ?

becker , how do you sleep at night ?

getting away with things . like whatever i may or may not have gotten away with officer harrison .

are you kidding me ? he 's not psychotic !

depends on what you 're seeing .

i 'm just looking at you . does that make you uncomfortable ?

i wish they 'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget . our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we do n't have .

i am . one of the few things i remember doing is eating . so i guess i must be exercising it off in my dreams .

his body was found on january 1 , 1993 , but do you know if that was long after he had died ?

mom , this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway . the guy you yelled at for no good reason ...

you 're bleeding pretty bad there .

i think so .

of course he will . [ beat ] what day of the week is it ?

here , drink this . i 'll get the heat going .

me , too .

maybe . i do n't know . seems more likely becker does , but at the very least she knows how i died .

no . they never figured it out . i did . most murderers do n't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road . not without hurting them .

yes .

do you really believe me ?

what ?

his body was found new year 's day , 19 ... 1993. at alpine ...

no , i do n't have anything to show you . i 'm here from a mental hospital .

jackie .

[ beat ] what 's your name ?

yeah , but i do n't know what .

i do believe you ...

you still do n't believe me , do you ?

you 're going to be ok , william . we just need to get your fever down and we 'll be able to hopefully stabilize you .

you told me this was how it happened .

because of the future . i know what 's going to happen .

no . not for people like me . [ beat ] not in the places i come from .

[ beat ] i 've seen a time that 's not this time . and i 'm only able to see it when i 'm in the jacket .

[ beat ] i do n't know .

so it 's helping ?

mackenzie , [ beat ] what if we are crazy ?

so what am i supposed to do ?

it 's gon na be sticky .

or just plain stupid . you 'd think by the twentieth time , i 'd have found an alternative method . maybe a more effective one , if you know what i mean .

i tried something like 30 times . there is , as starks rightly figures , no suitable response to that .

i tried to kill my wife .

that 's kingsley . old bastard hears us , i 'm sure . he just does n't want to bother answering so he makes us think he ca n't talk . i know . i tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue . literally . [ beat ] you 're the cop killer , right ?

great , get in . we 'll switch off in a bit .

sure .

can you drive ?

yeah , me too . [ softly ] every day for the last ten years .

may be easy to remember , but not easy to get . being warm , maybe -- but , look , you do n't even have a coat and i still have to chop wood to make a fire . [ beat ] and , being happy ... you tell me if that 's simple .

this is a great song .

have you always been a waitress ?

no , i 'm ok .

i 'll manage .

[ beat ] thanks .

darryl .

no you wo n't . you 'll be back today . now ! you get your ass back here , thelma , now , goddamnit . thelma , do you understand me ?

'bye , honey . i wo n't wait up .

damnit , thelma , do n't holler like that ! have n't i told you i ca n't stand it when you holler in the morning .

honey . nothing 's impossible . you just do n't shoot someone like that for no reason . maybe he was askin ' for it . anyway , somebody 's husband probably got ol ' harlan .

why ?

umm , yes . she was driving .

has anybody asked his wife ? she 's the one i hope did it .

you know , certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind , things like incarceration , cavity search , life imprisonment , death by electrocution , that sort of thing . so , come out alive ? i do n't know . let us think about that .

how are things goin ' out there ?

we 're both fine .

why do n't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this .

that 's certainly possible .

we 're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in . someone will be here until we find them .

right . where are they ?

how ?

what ? ! parole officer ? you mean you 're a criminal ?

oh . i ... where 's louise ?

well , you wan na use the shower ?

do n't mind me , jimmy , i 'm just a wild woman .

maybe .

louise , honey ... where are you ? you sound funny .

then let 's not get caught .

what in the hell is it ? !

way up ahead !

yeah , right . we 're not gon na get caught .

i guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught .

i mean really ! that business with your tongue . what is that ? that 's disgusting !

we should head a little further in . there 's not that many roads in this state . i want to try to hit mexico somewhere not so close to new mexico . they probably wan na kill us in new mexico .

good .

louise , do you think we should change cars , get another car ?

gosh , did n't he say anything positive at all ?

yes .

what ?

okay , louise ... it 's okay .

... in texas ... did n't it ? that 's what happened ... oh my god .

thelma !

just the look on his face when you ... ... it 's not funny .

what ? ! what about him ? !

what ? !

nothing . it 's not funny .

well , now , maybe you wo n't have to .

what little dogs ?

just stop talkin ' to people , thelma ! stop bein ' so open ! we 're fugitives now . let 's behave that way !

how 'd they find out we 're going to mexico , thelma , how they know that ?

it wo n't work .

what for ?

try to .

you 're disturbed .

i 'm sorry . well , we need the money . now we have it .

what happened ?

i 'm sorry . i am happy . i 'm very happy for you . i 'm glad you had a good time . it 's about time . where is he now ?

what 's wrong with you ?

thelma kinda took to him .

yup . that 's him goin ' . i love to watch him go .

louise and darryl do n't get along .

thelma ! i 'm not gon na talk about this ! now find another way or give me the goddamn map and i will ! you understand ?

well , it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards dallas , then cut over to ...

i 'm sorry . i 'm just not in the mood for company right now . here . take this map . i need you to find all the secondary roads to mexico from oklahoma city . i think we should stay off the interstates . we 're too conspicuous .

call him . do n't tell him anything . tell him you 're having a wonderful time and you 'll be home tomorrow night .

but you think he fools around .

did you finish thinking ?

well , when you figure it out , wake me up .

why do n't you ditch that loser husband of yours ?

jeez , louise , that was n't very nice .

oh yeah , sure , thelma , that lantern will come in real handy . maybe we could tow your car behind , in case he steals the spark plugs .

i wan na take it anyway . just in case .

i do n't know how to fish , louise .

what ?

hey , shit-for-brains , be careful not to scratch that thing , huh ?

so you admit it ?

woogie , i caught you red-handed .

oh god , i 'm fucking nervous . i do n't know if i 'm ready for this , man .

and this adversely affects me how ... ?

remember our friend healy ? well , i did n't know where to mail his last paycheck so i sent my assistant by his mother 's apartment . turns out there is no diabetic mom . landlord said she 's been dead for ten years .

what ?

mary 's a babe !

jesus , ted , you 've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine .

what if you 're wrong ? you just said she 's the only girl you ever loved , what have you got to lose by calling her ?

yeah , right .

i mean since then .

each day is better than the next . have you ever been , you know ... in love with someone ?

it must be great with a wife like that .

oh , so i 'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion ?

from high school mary ? yeah , i saw her about six months ago at a convention in las vegas .

who ?

aw , christ , i ca n't take it anymore . i 'm gon na pack my bags and go back to my own place .

would you like a glass of tea or something ?

the bottom line is , i 'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency ... especially after what i did . i lied to this poor girl . lied , man . she deserved better .

dumbshit .

uh , i 'm fine . just wanted to let you know i 'll have your car back in a couple hours , i 'm still staking out this girl 's apartment .

here , just have one of these then .

not for me , buddy . i do n't drink anymore .

warren !

urrggghh ...

all set .

hey , watch your mouth -- she 's a great gal . i 'm the dumbshit for lying to her .

huh ... that 's strange .

how about -- ?

is this one art deco or art nouveau ?

that 's what i said , so i went out and got him a leash you know , one of those clothesline runners for the backyard . he 's got plenty of room out there to dig . the kid 's really blossomed . now i can take him to ball games , movies -- you know , happy stuff .

-- he 's in a cage ? !

the hell with that . no one 's gon na tell me who i can and ca n't work with .

you know ... ... the guys who ride the short bus .

well , it was nice meeting you , again .

here . spend it on your trip to katmandu .

jai alai ?

you sure , big guy ? i 'll bet she 'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy !

well i 'm guessing . there 's a black kid , two whites , and a midget .

four kids , three different guys .

but you know , you shit out a bunch of kids , you 're going to put on a few pounds .

right there in liberty city . and you were right , she 's really something .

you want her dead , do n't you ?

she 's blackmailing you , right ?

any idea where i might start looking ?

look , if it was n't you who sent the letter , and it was n't me who sent it ?

oh that makes a lot of sense . why would i rat myself out ?

fucking sickening .

oh yeah , the plan was going along just fine until you showed up .

nice .

how 'd you manage that one ?

nice smokescreen , is n't it ?

yes yes , i did get my degree up there .

think about it . you walk into a video store and you see eight-minute abs and right next to it you see seven- minute abs -- which one you gon na spring for ?

hm ?

all right for awhile ? the guy 's good- looking , rich , witty . he was a god .

no i 'm not .

ugh , not pecs . sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock .

oh no ? i ai n't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the blue monster .

do n't bet on it . last time i had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker .

do n't get ahead of yourself . you 'll probably need it before i will .

bundt cake ?

good lookin ' ?

i ca n't believe this is happening . i 'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour .

no no no , tucker , thank you .

that 's what you 've been looking for -- a farter ?

he 's a nice guy , is n't he ?

woogie and i went out for awhile in high school .

that you put a murderer on my trail ?

get out .

yeah , sure .

what about you , mare ? how the hell 'd you manage to stay single ?

well good for you . i bet it works out for you .

so you 're a writer ?

i say they should put more meats on a stick , you know ? they got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles , fudgesicles , lollipops -- but hardly any meat .

okay , sometimes i 'm a nineteen .

twenty-two .

'cause i thought maybe you and i could go if you were n't already taking someone .

the prom -- you going ?

so who you taking to the prom ?

i , uh ... i got it stuck .

yeah ? what do you want ?

what do you mean ?

yeah , i 'll bet you all were . come on , in the truck .

jesus , i think her brother spotted me .

giddy-up .

i believe the president made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission .

lying bastard . lied to my face .

and if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution ?

we 're getting everyone together as fast as we can .

if you 're home it means either jack and bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you , or --

busy . but you 've got his heart .

i 've got to move . what do you have , kenny ?

hello ?

you 'd worry that something was wrong if congress offered you unconditional support .

we have to try the blockades . it probably wo n't work . it may just be delaying the inevitable . but we ca n't just go to war without trying not to .

cheer up , you 've neutralized the entire white house press corps for a day .

okay . kenny and i only show for the meetings you call us into . impress us . and do it fast . you 're in charge of keeping this quiet . if word gets out before we know what we 're going to do , there 'll be panic . and it 'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them .

so what 've we got today ?

of course it is . but the president needs to realize we 're going to have to stop a ship eventually .

six months from now , i 'm not going to care . are you ? we 'll deal with it .

that may be why khruschev 's introducing this guy . we 've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels , so he brings in an honest broker .

captain , force the sub to the surface for inspection .

do n't have one , carl . i have a number , man . just like the numbers on those treasury checks . you stole from your own country , carl . shame on you .

jesus christ , larry , what the fu -- larry . that 's not even your name , is it ? what 's your real name , you fucking scumbag ?

anyone stops us going in , we 're with the bowen-hamilton textile company . we have rug samples .

breathe , carl . four , nice , deep ones .

are you hungry ? i have some nice raw kidney in the truck .

you know how in your big cities , you got your niggers and you got your puerto ricans ? well out here we got indians . that 's just the way it is .

fbi ? what you investigatin ' ?

different culture . hard to penetrate . the indians do n't like white cops poking around . and that 's why we 're in a position where we have to bring in an american indian agent .

ray , there 's been a homicide out in an area known as the badlands . indian reservation .

interesting bloodline you have , ray . french , scots-irish , italian , ... and one-eighth american indian .

you ai n't gon na cut his hands off and send 'em to washinton , are ya ? they done that to one of our girls once . leo did quillwork , he 's gon na need his hands .

let the press through .

listen : when we get back tomorrow , you 're gon na find tully laying a promotion on you . s.a.c . he wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good . he 's offering you new york . tell him you want atlanta .

-- never mind eagle bear . we 've got jimmy nailed . let 's go !

tread matches . it 's the car .

she 's that subtle ?

it may have been maggie 's way of saying `` get off my ass . ''

bastards ...

ray . i never get into bed with somebody unless i know for sure . just the way i was raised .

get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars .

airborne . that 's where they used to get us agents from . now we get 'em from carnegie-melon , ivy league . accountants and computer whiz-kids . yuppies with guns . that 's scary shit .

were you in nam ?

we 're going for the stronghold .

listen to the water ... the river keeps goin ' down then rising again .

leo knew about it . tried to tell jimmy , get the warriors involved .

what 's that ?

what the hell do you want me to do ? !

yeah . fitful dreams .

we 've driven a long way . where is this place ?

no . i was sent here cuz i 'm indian . and a good cop .

they found prints at blue legs ' place .

not no more .

you 're right about the old man . his power 's long dried up . he 's supposed to be a medicine man but he wo n't go see the people . he says we changed , and we do n't listen . well , he do n't go out and talk no more . i have n't had a drink in three years but i just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar , and this hoss is gettin ' watered .

likewise .

do n't tell me : heavy duty .

that 's not solid .

i see . forgive my cultural ignorance .

listen to the water . listen to the owl . he also said , do n't trust the fucking cookie monster .

because he was talking to me .

he wants to know if you ever watch the cookie monster . he says the cookie monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster .

grandpa samuel reaches . heavy duty medicine .

thank god . now listen to me , asshole . i 'm giving you a break . but if my partner finds out you 're here , you 're gon na be reading rat tracks in sioux falls maximum security .

his spiritual mother ...

what ? !

watch out !

great .

grandpa reaches says you come from heavy indian blood . i used to think grandpa was gettin ' senile . now i know he is .

when you see jimmy , tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in ... the sooner we back off this reservation . okay ?

thank you .

who did ?

this jimmy 's ?

yellow bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning . some gung-ho agent from d.c. pushed him into a corner . you 're playing a losing game . pull over .

ray . what 's your 20 ?

no plates . no registration . serial numbers removed . and all prints washed off by the river . that 's great . this is turning out to be a walk in the park , do you know that ?

-- yes , teton sioux . father 's side .

no . no , no . thank you .

mister tully .

i took him out before he got the chance . he did n't say nothin ' about tashka sha . and now his spirit is in the dirt . forever .

the men who came to see you at leavenworth . the one 's who made the arrangement ... who were they ? maybe i can talk to them .

what the fuck , man ? what do you people want ? i did what you wasi'cu 's told me to do .

what 's with you people ? why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time ? i came through , man .

yes , washington sent me , richard . they sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked . do you know what i mean when i say this whole thing has been fucked , richard ?

we 'll say it together . on the count of three ... one ... two ...

your watch .

what do you do when you come here ?

i want it back .

why ? you act like you did n't know one day this would happen .

does n't it ever bother you ?

in that order ?

i want it understood .

i do n't know yet .

i watched my mother die . cancer . she had a long time to think about it . they say you reach an agreement with death . come to accept the fact that pretty soon you wo n't be here . i did n't see that . she ... was very brave ... braver than i am . you go up there , there is n't time to think . if you make a mistake , you 're just a smudge on the ground . simplifies funeral arrangements .

what if you kill yourself ? think of everything you 'll miss . maverick there is lots of stuff i do n't know about ... fine wine ... great art ... the opera . i guess if i live long enough , i 'll get to it . if i do n't , i 'll never miss it .

that 's it , of course . when i 'm up there and doing it , i 'm cheating it every second . i 'm subverting all laws ... gravity ... whatever . i 'm skating the edge of it .

i 'm not your foe . charlie and if he 's harmless , you disengage .

two .

well , it is . it is that , too .

it 's not that .

now i know why all the girls come here . they know how horny you guys get . but this ... is ridiculous .

yes sir . i do , sir .

maintaining course . straight for mustang .

okay ... okay . but if i land this thing upside down . and i live . i 'll have your butt !

they must be broken . i 'm hanging in my straps ! we 're inverted !

what ? what is it ?

wait ! hell ! ..something 's wrong !

this is crazy !

lordy ! eyeball to asshole . hope nobody burps !

he better be kidding !

you 're not supposed to ...

passing 8. passing 6. lock your harness !

rudder 's left , stick 's forward .

ohhh mother !

do n't tell me okay . do it !

did n't ... ahhh ... look good .

what ? where 're you -- hey , where in the hell are you going ?

oh ... i 'll think of something .

you got ta have a call sign that 's just your own ... never changes ... you have to recognize it immediately . then , if someone shouts `` wolf , break left ! `` ..you react right away .

nice . always a good idea to show up your instructors . he nods toward jester , glaring at them from his a4 . goose indicates the backseat of the tomcat .

time to go .

come on , come on ! it 's double or nothing.. we 're talking twelve bucks american , here .

i 've lost him -- where is he ?

what do these guys think , i made cougar quit ?

she 's kinky for flight suits -- said that she 'd never seen so many zippers -- played with them all night . the noise alone kept me up .

no shit ! that why they call him ice ?

coogan spent half the night looking for her . he said he was gon na kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister .

it 's not the plaque . the winner can get assigned here as instructor . he gets to fight every day .

nope .

some guys never get it back .

i 've seen this before .

it 's only been a week . keep sending him up .

helping him in .

ah , the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat .

you did n't help .

would you take me back ? would they ?

i did n't say that . that 's up to you . i think that if you do , if you choose to come back , you 'll be a better pilot ... a better man .

sometimes it 's luck , but in this case , he earned it ... i served with your old man .

you think i should quit ? !

but maybe you can change all that .

whatcha doin ' to me , man ? ! i got six kids to feed !

impossible . once the reaction starts , it 'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet . mars will go into global meltdown. -- that 's why the aliens never turned it on .

he had help . from our side , sir .

okay , this is what we 're gon na do . renata , cover up any memory he has of us or rekall .

you 're strapped into an implant chair , and i 'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console .

this is going to be very difficult for you at accept , mr. quaid .

where 's kuato ?

sit down .

well do n't .

i do n't know . maybe .

nooo ! i would never do anything to hurt you . i want you to come back to me .

i did n't know you were so kinky .

you sure you do n't wan na ... ? for old time 's sake . if you do n't trust me , you can tie me up .

o.k . then . if i 'm not me , then who the hell am i ?

bullshit .

i 'm not your wife .

you went to those brain butchers ? !

all right , forget about it .

and you believe him ?

nobody .

i give up .

all right .

i 'm not interested in saturn . i said mars .

now help me out here , doug . you were interested in a memory of ...

it 's just up ahead .

people are dying , quaid ! ! stop ! ! we 've got to get air ! !

the reactor .

you never loved me , hauser ! you just used me to get inside .

i do n't remember you . i do n't remember us . i do n't even remember me .

i do n't remember you .

cannon fuse .

i do n't know ... they 're pretty quick ... fifteen seconds ?

you two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here ... ! ?

or a big mother slug maybe ?

knock it off , burt !

you 're never going to believe this , but the canyon road ... we were on it not two hours ago ... well , it 's completely ...

well , yeah ! there 's going to be major research up here . first thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up .

you bet . you gon na be staying up here ?

could we make it to the mountains ?

so ... now what ?

son of a bitchin ' lowlife , putrid , scum ...

no good . you need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail .

probably could n't move too easily on the surface .

what ?

use the fucking bomb !

jesus , val , it 's pretty far .

i think we wait right here .

okay , now , how far 's your truck ?

you got < u > that < /u > right !

< u > why < /u > would they do it ?

screw you . for all you know they could < u > fly < /u > .

brother , we decided to leave this place just one day too late , you know ?

i 'll go with that plan .

damn straight ! now there 's nothing between us and bixby but nothing !

damn it , val ! not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this !

nestor 's out of town tomorrow . we do n't dig today . we do n't get paid today . damn it , valentine , you never plan ahead . you never take the long view . hell , here it is monday and i 'm already working on wednesday . it is monday , right ?

you 're gon na get us hung up .

if there was one nearby i 'd probably ask him .

i was in one . a bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree . three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon . was n't so damn funny , i can tell you .

i 'd do the same . well , catch you thursday .

we playing cards tonight ?

yeah , heather , we got you .

yeah . but i 'll tell you , if you ever wanted proof god is a man , this is it .

yeah , geography .

you 're fishing . you do n't know shit .

i suppose i could find an inmate who 'd say that shu boasted about chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he did n't really do it ...

-- with objection !

objection , your honor ! the fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial !

ca n't i take a simple piss without --

no it 's not the only issue . there 's another issue , for the jury . what about entrapment ?

clyde , you wait here . glenn , got a minute ?

ah .

... an hour . that 's why i thought the morgue was on the other side of town .

i followed her from the courthouse .

you know how i know ? 'cause reynard says he 's guilty , and reynard 's full of shit ! look --

but what ?

... what do you mean ?

saving it for the sunday times .

shoulda told the one about shu being the bastard child of mother theresa .

i do n't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement .

some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists . the mayor pressures the cops . the cops pressure the rival gang -- the joe boys . the joes give up shu kai kim -- the schmuck kid from korea who 's been pestering 'em to get in .

we 're taking the other case .

-- a speed manufacturer --

i 'm not a kid anymore , i ca n't be all over the map --

we have a full caseload , rog .

they 're chinamen who speak english . we call them informants .

do you speak cantonese , mandarin , or both ?

exactly !

the joe boys in 1980 ... !

so there goes your theory about the joes giving up shu to protect their trigger man .

i was never politically correct enough for comrade dowd .

lem me guess . some corporate v.p . 's banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder .

it was self-defense .

i do n't know . the truth , maybe .

afraid of what ?

`` painted '' ?

an aryan warrior with black teardrops painted on his face .

figures .

they g-got the wrong g-guy .

are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot jimmy chin was not the man the cops arrested ?

no .

-- but you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation .

yes , mr. dowd .

i never joke about waiving a client 's sixth amendment right to trial .

my staff tells me it 's been mostly drug pushers ... i said that ca n't be the same edward dowd .

i 'll take odds on cecil number two .

my skip-trace turned up two cecil stipes . one 's in butte , montana . other 's at riverhead veterans psychiatric .

then it was your idea to have chuckie roeder scare eddie off the case ?

i knew jimmy chin . the boy who was shot . okay ?

what were you ... why were you at shu 's trial this afternoon ?

i 'm roger baron . i work with edward dowd .

shu 's the only one i know of ...

... a soldado , he takes care of it .

a cubano army , basically ... inside and outside prisons .

cia ?

no .

see what we can do to donna ?

go away . i am not talking to you .

baby laxative ? we ca n't snort baby laxative .

we got a phone , here , that 's got a little ring .

a basic kill . banks was a drifter and nobody knew her . my boys have been all over this . it 's a dead end .

what was here , mr. rodd ?

i am going over here .

maybe i just live here , what do you think about that ?

oregon . a young girl has been murdered . seventeen years old . named teresa banks .

stanley , i heard all about it .

oh , alright . you know , i liked agent desmond . he had his own m.o .

agent chet would n't tell me what the blue rose meant .

her left arm . it was numb . she said she could n't use it . said it had no feeling . probably from the drugs she was taking . i just thought i ought to tell you .

what do you mean ?

thanks .

did you ever see teresa take cocaine ?

jack and i are united in holy matrimony .

may i see the magnifying glass , agent desmond ? there does n't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring .

i 'll get my kit .

agent desmond , would you hold the finger for me . there 's something up there .

gordon said you were good . the tailored dress is our code for drugs . did you notice what was pinned to it ?

sort of shorthand .

laura , i am your friend .

not you , donna , not you .

where are you going ?

donna , you are a muffin .

maybe i better start our homework .

you know what your problem is ? you 're just too adorable ...

were you with bobby ? or are you two still fighting ?

james called me last night looking for you .

nice night .

maybe .

i am the muffin .

what are you talking about ? bobby did n't kill anybody .

oh , laura .

i ca n't tonight .

what about tonight ?

no , it does n't ... just kiss me .

we throw away the whole head .

believe me , josie , you would not offend the customs of this country . for instance , i do n't eat fish eyes .

i do n't want to offend the customs of your country .

oh , honey , you do n't have to lie to me . ever . you can tell me anything . i 'll understand .

i was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which i found balled up in the bottom of your closet . now why did you lie to me ? where did you go ?

you lied to me about those school books . i found them upstairs on your bed .

sure honey , what 's the hurry ?

stay away from me .

who was that ?

fine .

i do n't know .

lay off the bennies , leo .

someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot . shelly , i know where everything in this house is . sometimes on the road i mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is .

as far as we know , nothing .

neither does he . that 's where he loses . this man 's scared to death to go to court . we only have to call his bluff .

that that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life , she 's in a coma , her life is gone . she has no family , she has no home , she 's tied to a machine , she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her : her doctors , and you , and me , have been bought off to look the other way . we have been paid to look the other way . i came in here to take your money . i brought snapshots to show you . so i could get your money . i ca n't take it . if i take it . if i take that money i 'm lost . i 'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser . i ca n't do it . i ca n't take it .

and no one will know the truth .

yes .

you thought it was just .

it 's a generous offer , mr. galvin ... ... nothing can make the woman well ... but we try to compensate ... to make a gesture ...

you know what that would mean ?

... he wants to testify ... ?

... yes . get her on the phone ...

and why , please tell us , would you think that ?

... what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years ? this is a ... why ? why would you do that ?

yes , i , yes , i signed it , yes . but i , i did n't write that figure .

that 's not my handwriting .

the document is disallowed , the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of kathy costello regarding the xerox form . it 's unsubstantiated and we ca n't accept a copy in preference to the original ...

nothing further , your honor .

you reached down into death . now , is n't that right ?

... you brought thirty years of medical experience to bear . is n't that what you did ?

i was her doctor .

i 'm going to win this case ... mist ... mr. doneghy ... i 'm going to the jury with a solid case , a famous doctor as an expert witness , and i 'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars .

dr. thompson . from your review of the hospital records of may twelfth nineteen seventy-six .

... what difference would ...

dr. thompson ... ?

... i made a detailed physical examination of the patient , sir , yesterday evening , i ...

what are they going to do ? not invite me to their birthday party ... ? look , i got ta go . i have to be in cambridge ...

yes .

one hour .

i 've been meaning to come in a long time .

hi .

i 'm an attorney on trial before the bar . representing my client . my client , do you understand ? you open your mouth and you 're losing my case for me .

i had a witness disappear on me .

that 's perfectly all right .

this is a complicated case , your honor ...

stop pressuring me ...

you , you do n't under ...

you want me to tell you it 's your fault ? it probably is . what are you going to do about it ? i thought it 's not over till the jury comes in .

they might . yes . that 's the point ... is that they might ... you see , the jury wants to believe . they 're all cynics , sure , because they want to believe . i have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case . i 'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve . and every one of them it 's written on their face , 'this is a sham . there is no justice ... ' but in their heart they 're saying , 'maybe ... maybe ... '

that 's why i 'm calling , miss price ...

let me talk to mickey .

i ca n't guarantee that ...

i 'm sorry , sir , we 're not allowed ...

and ask me what ?

i can subpoena you , you know . i can get you up there on the stand .

you know what happened .

... you got your doctor 's testimony . why do you need me ?

i 'm going to see you get that chance .

he 's ... you ca n't reach him , sir . he 's in the , on some island in the caribbean , they do n't have a phone . he 'll be back in a week ... if you 'd like dr. halpern 's number ...

we do n't have anything from the nurse association ?

she did n't do anything . she took the patient 's history and signed the charts . ' k.c . ' 'kathy costello ... '

uh ... the admitting nurse ...

what difference can that make ... ? all right ...

all right . who was n't in the o.r . ?

i 've got to go see gruber . what 's the best cigars you have ?

what i 'm saying , they 're getting some help .

okay now . cases : smith versus state of michigan .

fuck you . i got a call today from sally doneghy ...

uh ...

we 'd gone to 'code blue , ' we were administering electro ...

... they start again three minutes earlier ...

... of the procedures ...

yes .

franky ca n't make it . he had an appointment he forgot , he 's going to see you later . i 'm mickey morrissey , we 're supposed to get to know each other .

hey , how about that !

looks almost cold now , do n't it ?

mister secretary - if they link up with those others near fresno ...

that explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move .

hey , you ! better get outa here !

is it possible to go in right after the explosion ?

it 's blocked here , too ! they 've pushed up earth or something all around outside . here , this way ... !

maybe they are n't too sure we 're here .

i 've been as close to them as anyone . but not close enough for real observation ...

but they seem to murder everything that moves ... !

automobile ignitions are insulated .

forrester 's the man behind the new atomic engines . they had him on the cover of 'time ' . you 've got to rate to get that !

oh - there were three of us . the others flew back in my plane . i do n't understand why a meteor this size did n't make a bigger crater .

it 's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down .

it might give us time to search out some weakness in the martians .

this martian blood ... let 's make a quick analysis and see what we 've got !

colonel - shooting 's no good !

if they 're more advanced than us , they should be nearer the creator for that reason !

i do n't follow .

we 'll work something out . i 'm sure you 'll be happy with it .

yes , but ...

so ?

he 's excited about the script . you should be too . it stars you .

believe it or not , he told me i had n't heard from him in ten years because he has n't had any good nightmare . they 're his inspiration . but now he 's got a new script in the works .

we did . bad mistake . the fans are clamoring for more . so , evil never dies , right ? anyway , a while back we got a call from wes . he 's got this idea . and who better to resurrect freddy than his creator ?

chase . why did n't chuck or terry show up ?

what ? what kind of episode ?

48 hours . back before you know it .

no biggie , really .

he sleepwalks , you idiot ! he 's fully capable of walking out of this hospital . oh my god ... he thinks i 've gone home ...

if these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist ... what did you say you cut yourself on ?

no .

right 'cross the freeway .

i know he is , sweetie . we 'll both go get rex right now .

rex saved me .

you going away ?

wes wo n't show it until it 's finished . that 's what he told me , at least . i asked him at the funeral .

call it a guess ...

i do n't know why you did n't tell me , that 's all .

quake knocked you off your feet . you got bumped pretty good , actually .

i want to see for myself .

the car 's no there yet ?

no , rex is not going to die . julie , you know where the sewing stuff is , do n't you ?

heather , what is it ?

the way to stop him is to make another movie . and i swear to you i 'll stay at my computer and keep writing until i finish the script . but when that time comes ... you 're gon na have to make a choice .

dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense . you played nancy , after all , the first to humiliate and defeat him .

like the genie in the bottle .

this is still a script we 're talking about , right ?

killing innocence , one way or the other .

black 's fine .

he would have loved this .

did we lose anybody ?

give me some time to blow the man down !

weight ! hey ! blow the man down ...

give me some time to blow the man down ...

i did n't know sir .

it was an act of god for christ 's sake .

what the `` bowsprit affair '' ?

i feel like ... we can do anything .

me either .

listen , you do n't cheat , and we 'll make sure you get the grades . we 'll start a private study group . nobody knows . you 'll ace that test .

i doctored my grades so i 'd make the cut . i 'm a moron , okay ? you satisfied ? !

that 's what they get for not locking the door .

you do n't give him enough credit chas .

what 's the difference ?

like this !

but that 's not the point ...

sorry to here it .

i ca n't watch this .

what the hell is going on ?

the fact is ... we 'd like you to give phil another chance .

sometimes it gets exciting out here .

remember something , sooner or later ... we all have to face it .

northeast sir !

and , of course , we are .

he 's a big boy .

happily , it all worked out ... this time . bill , take philip below and help him find a bunk .

oh , on the contrary , the albatross is considered a very good omen . it is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on . it 's very bad luck if you kill one . and dolphins too .

humor me . eat it anyway .

i should be eating with the crew .

lem me go ! lem me go ! !

i can show you how to use a slide rule .

that 's enough .

read on , young john . read on . college boards are coming .

this is n't just a story ! ! it 's history made allegory . it is a philosophical handbook for life ! it holds the secret of this very voyage .

much have i traveled in realms of gold/ and many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ round many western islands have i been/ which bards in fealty to apollo hold/ oft of one wide expanse had i been told/ that deep-browed homer ruled as his demesne .

i do n't .

it 's outta here !

fandango , junior . i 'm gon na do some limbo baby ! !

long enough .

the first thing is i do n't like people talking when i 'm talking so the two of you , shut up .

i do n't know ...

what are you blubbering about ?

up you go . right now .

except , a `` white squall '' . with all due respect captain sheldrake , they 're only boys ...

what makes you so sure it was one ?

meetin ' him at the gate . that phone call this afternoon was the signal . my deranged mama 's hid the keys to my car . but of course , i know exactly where they are .

i can dig this music ... but not that singer .

we do n't have no paper bags .

am i scarin ' ya ? ... your pussy wet ? ... come on ... is it ? ... hey , do n't jump back so slow ... i thought you was a bunny ... bunny jump fast - you jump back slow ... mean somethin ' , do n't it ? ... means somethin ' to me ... means you want bobby peru ... you want bobby peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a christmas present .

how old are you ?

do n't think about it too long . you had enough ?

couple grand or more 'd give you two a leg up . get you to the west coast , mexico , most anyplace , with a few dollars in your jeans . i got it figured good , sailor .

i been studyin ' a situation over in lobo , take two men to handle it .

why not ?

you an indian ?

you was in the marines , huh ?

you heard from reggie ?

oh , many things ...

do n't know that i have ... should i know about you for anythin ' in particular ?

my name 's george kovich . bet you 've heard of me .

the real joke is we never went fishing , but we 're still fishing .

did i tell ya it 's great to see ya again ?

i 'll meet you , marietta , if that 's what you want , but i 'm against it .

marietta , i was just gon na leave and see if i could pick up their trail .

how 'd she sound ? was she doin ' okay ?

no , but my guess is they 're headed west , so prob'ly texas . their money must be runnin ' low . i do n't think sailor had much to begin with , if any , and lula took the six hundred she had saved in the cherokee thrift .

i 'm stayin ' right here by the phone until you find lula , then i 'm comin ' to get her . you call soon 's you got somethin ' , even if it 's three in the a.m .

maybe i was there , but i did n't see anythin ' . all i know 's that trash killed a man with his bare hands . hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby !

like you , sweetheart . you and your daddy got the same mouth , eyes , ears , and nose . only difference is your color hair is like mine .

it 's a mistake , honey . you two go on . i 'll walk back to the depot .

lead the way .

i mean tomorrow .

let 's leave here .

some ... sparky said red 's promised to have him and buddy out of here by the weekend .

yeah ?

and no ac .

well , it ai n't exactly emerald city ...

i do n't know , honey , but we got ta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on i broke parole .

if you say so .

well , we 're really out in the middle of it now , ai n't we ?

that 's some big secret you been carryin ' , sailor .

this ai n't news , sweetheart . i hate to tell ya .

i ca n't take no more of this radio ... i ai n't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life , sailor ripley , you find me some dancin ' music right this minute ... i mean it ! !

hard to tell what 's shakin ' in a place like this , honey . you do n't want to be walkin ' in the wrong door .

he was sittin ' there havin ' a beignet at the cafe du monde . do you think he saw us ?

who do ?

sometimes dreams just do n't mean nothin ' ... stuff comes into your mind and you do n't have no control over , you know ? anyways , dreams ai n't no odder than real life . sometimes not by half .

you think so , baby ? does my talkin ' bother you , honey ?

my god , it better be , darlin ' , cause it 'd be the last ... what time is it ?

huh ?

sailor ripley ! you stop ! you 're makin ' this shit up and i ai n't gon na sit for it !

m-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i ... you can almost hear that jazz blowin ' up from the big n.o .

almost . i figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat .

what kinda trash talk is that ?

you still got plenty energy for me , baby .

musta been a lesson tellin ' ya it was the wrong time ... what did you do , your mama find out ?

gift certificates to kentucky fried chicken .

that 's good ... now go get yourself a beer . you fellas have alotta the same power elvis had ... y'all know this one ?

i 'm always ready to dance . but i need me a kiss first , honey . just one ?

one hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 ford pick-up and a '64 chevy station wagon . no survivors . balls of flame and grinding metal .

'we ' did it ? whattaya mean ? did n't he force you ?

sailor , you are somethin ' else , honey ... when i was fifteen , mama told me that pretty soon i 'd be startin ' to think about sex , and i should talk to her before i did anything about it .

what brand 'd she smoke ?

really , mama , i got ta go .

course i am , mama .

do n't be crazy , mama . take care of yourself .

i ai n't that dumb , mama . sailor and i been on a crime spree ? knockin ' off convenience stores all across the south ? ai n't you read about it ?

need me for what , mama ? i 'm perfectly fine , and safe , too .

like hell .

and jus when my baby 's out on some texas road with a killer .

oh god ! what does that mean ?

please santos ... where 's johnnie ?

got word the kids are moving through texas ... i think an ending is being arranged there ... come on , lem me see a smile .

i got your message ... but you went right to johnnie , did n't you ? ... i ca n't trust you , bitch - not for one minute ... naughty girl ... sailor and lula are headed west , and guess what ? there 's no turning back . i 'm in a killing mood .

santos ... you kill that sailor , otherwise he 's gon na turn my baby against me .

through the forehead ?

i want you to get rid of sailor .

big is the key word , and i 'm telling you i want it bad .

you 're gon na have to kill me to keep me away from lula .

hey , sailor boy , you wan na fuck lula 's mama ? ...

... yes you heard me ... do n't ever call back here again .

no offense , professor tripp , but you look sorta crappy .

i like what you 've done with it . when 's captain nemo moving in ?

hey . what are you guys doing here ?

i peeked .

the jacket , tripp . we need the jacket .

call it a hunch .

he said a few things that lead me to believe the car 's his .

great . between you and officer pupcik out there he can be the next jean genet . it 's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail .

i want to publish this . i 've got to . i think they 'll let me . with a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant .

who do you think it is ?

oh , christ , do n't start on ol ' gran or we 'll leave you here .

i told you . they keep him chained in the basement . come on .

you know -- based on what i 've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material , this big parade .

wait here . i 'll be right back .

that was good .

groom . named claudell . and his mother blames vernon for his death .

he lives with his mother .

i think it 's more complicated than that . besides , he 's a little ... scattered . he almost ... did something stupid tonight . at least , i think so . anyway , he does n't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now .

primarily . although i gather you two staged a little raid on the crabtree pharmacopoeia . you missed a few bottles , by the way .

i thought you were mrs. gaskell 's hobby , tripp .

yeah , between a bookie and a pair of broken legs .

great . i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime this weekend . think that might be possible ?

she 's still a transvestite .

oh , professor tripp ? you know , last semester , what i said that time in office hours -- i hope there 's no hard feelings .

that 's probably not the problem , then . what about your lifestyle . any major changes recently ?

right . well , thanks . for the lift .

not true . you 're the only vernon i know . actually , i 'm wrong . i once knew a vernon peabody at penguin u.k .

no . sara , you do n't understand ...

what ? no . there 's no one here . i 'm just ... just ...

could you hold on a minute , honey ?

professor tripp ... ?

well , let 's see if we can keep that from happening .

in the crawl space , with the rats and the casks of amontillado . come on . up .

i remember that . five or six years ago .

nowhere . you just sit here and ... eat .

it 's because you do n't eat .

no thanks .

you coming ?

so , why did you take me up there ?

sure you do . you were thinking : 'that 's no cap gun in that kid 's overcoat . ' you were thinking ' i ca n't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again . ' you were thinking : ' i 've got to find a way to distract this kid . ' so you did . it was -- in its way -- a noble act .

you 're mad because i shot your girlfriend 's dog .

it 's not that . it just reminded me of -- you know -- of what 's in the car . in the trunk .

relax . emily has n't carried a house key since she was twelve years old . and your hips are as slim as hers .

you can see the outline of a butt .

did n't you say your mom went to catholic school ?

it 's not so bad . i know the night janitor . and there 's a broken locker i can put my stuff .

washed up ?

but ... ?

what 'd he say ?

sure .

oh . so . is -- is your friend crabtree -- is he -- gay ?

he 's dead , james . believe me , i know a dead dog when i see one .

right .

pretty good . i 'm friends with dr. gaskell , too .

you 're really good friends with the chancellor , are n't you ?

they really hated it . i think they hated it more than any of the other ones .

it 's not bad .

you 're not like my other teachers , professor tripp .

i thought we were going to talk . last night .

hh-uh . last time i saw it was ...

hannah , are you telling me you do n't know where james leer lives ?

he 's going with me . you take crabtree . and his friend . all right ?

i think maybe we 're missing the point . it seems to me james ' strength as a writer is that he does n't take us by the hand . he treats us like adults . he respects us enough to forget us . that takes ... courage .

i know , but sometimes ...

in the hospital . i was kind of excited about it at the time , but then i was on pretty heavy painkillers .

i told walter .

did you tell walter ?

oh ?

oh , grady . you 're such a putz .

i believe you . i believe you want to be with me . but this is not just about me anymore .

did you confess ?

totally . i 'm sorry . a lot was happening this morning . can you talk ?

heavy . smells like gunpowder .

do n't . i know what you 're going to say .

sara , my arm . i 'm stuck , honey .

i 'm sure .

walter just got it back from the framer today .

that 's nice . all we have is a japanese beetle trap .

what 's that ?

nevertheless , i 'd like to see you in my office monday morning .

oh ?

grady tripp . english department .

only when i 'm working .

christ , traxler . how the hell should i know ?

why did you come here , grady ?

it 's no arsonist 's daughter , but i guess you know that . it 's a young man 's book . it got me remembering how it felt to be young .

yes . he 's a good kid . maybe a little messed up .

a jockey ? you mean , like --

well , there 's always people you do n't know at these things , but i ca n't say there was anybody particularly suspicious ... wait . there was one guy . tiny fella . claimed to be a jockey .

i have n't heard of half of those .

pills . august 25 , 1972. in a costa brava hotel room .

ask me . ask me anything .

nothing .

it 's crazy out there . young girls wearing mini this and mini that . sometimes when i walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman , she makes me feel like i 'm bothering her . she stares down like she 's afraid to look at me . why she do that ? why ca n't she look me in the face ?

anna will be away at camp . the house will be quiet . it 's better when it 's quiet .

what 's that ?

i know , man . i love this table too . but i also love my wife .

it 's made from cherry . that 's a hard wood .

this little table is one heavy bitch .

only if it 's no closer than a hundred feet .

i told her all my relatives are good- looking .

how does it sound ?

the mother sure has her hands full .

why not ?

i do n't like starlings .

you 're a cop . figure it out .

you could . it 'd be a waste of your time , though .

the one with the ax ?

yeah .

i know because ... it 's just something i know .

do you want me to sit on your lap ?

are you sure ?

would you like to sit on my lap ?

it was a small house .

okay i 'll tell you what i did -- just to shut you up ! i smelled her hair .

i do n't like nobody behind my back !

yes , a nap . kids do that . you ever take a nap , rosen ?

a nap ?

sorry . where is she ?

not so fast .

when did it all start ?

whatever my ideas are of being a jew is not going to help you . why do n't we continue this on thursday .

will i ever be normal ?

we have a lot of work to do .

i mean , when will i be normal .

we have a few more minutes .

it was just an idea .

ev-i-dence .

diaries have sent too many guys to prison .

that 's right , you did . have you made any friends there ?

i said the job is okay .

i 've got problems .

not ever .

for men like me . they say most of us end up back ... there . i 'm saying there are risks ... seeing me .

nothing . it 's over .

my father took me fishing here when i was a kid . he could name every fish in the lake . and for every fish he named , he had a fishing story . i hated fishing , but i loved his stories .

no . prison is time . that 's it . you think time , you feel time , you hear time . your heart does n't beat to live , it just beats ... time .

you mean the time you 're locked away ?

get your kicks somewhere else .

why do n't you just go now , okay ?

sorry .

what 's the worst thing you ever did ?

hi .

i did n't say i did n't enjoy it .

you 're still here .

hey , that was ... intense .

do n't you think i should know before we have sex ?

why do you want to know ?

i 'm not easily shocked .

yeah ?

what do you think ?

no way that could just be seawater .

no ! i 'm okay now . i just do n't ... i ca n't go any further in .

lord almighty .

who then ?

it 's the only way , bud . now trust me .

what kind of plan is that ! ? ?

you dumb jarhead motherf --

how can i go on a feeling ? you think coffey 's going to go on you 'feeling ' ?

the storm 's gon na last longer than 12 hours .

i can get power to this module and sub-bay if i remote these busses . i 've got ta get past the mains , which are a total melt-down .

what do you think he saw ?

you 're right , bud . it was just that simple . are n't you clever ? you should get your own show ... ask dr. bud , advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms .

i 'll tell you what happened ... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh .

i think you were worried about me .

not particularly . jeez , look where this is set ! morons .

yup , a benthic petroleum paid for it . so as long as they 're hold the pink slip , i go where they tell me .

i ca n't believe you let them do this !

let 's go , guys .

meet me in the moonpool . move fast .

it 's got ta be , like , an emergency plan to keep it away from the russians ... hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator , put it back in the sub , and fry the whole thing , slicker ' n snot . oh , uh ... hi , lins .

hippy , you think everything 's a conspiracy .

virgil ?

are we talkin ' little space friend here ?

24 trident missiles . eight mirvs per missile .

we 've been fully briefed , mrs. brigman .

he ca n't get to the door ... i think he 's going to try and take him himself .

let 's go for it . we could get lucky .

a non-terrestrial intelligence .

but why rattle your brains by arguing and talking ... believe me , anna , words never help at all . they only serve to confuse . i love you , anna . is n't i that enough ?

in this case , getting married means nothing . are n't we already the same as being married ? and corrado and giulia -- are n't they already the same as being married ?

a little more so this time .

fine . ca n't you see so yourself ?

i 'd like to find a place where i can get some peace and rest , maybe around here somewhere . i 'd like to try ...

you already know what they are .

used to what ?

and how long will you be away ?

is n't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor 's cap with the name of the yacht ?

sir , if you have no objections , may we start the search ?

without any doubt , sir . if anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island ...

there 's no comparison .

more so than the shark ?

all i said was that it sounds like a good idea .

well , what ?

well ?

you said you wanted to quit working for ettore .

then i 'll see you later .

so , you wonder why ?

but you know it already . why must i tell you ?

but it 's so sad . so terribly sad . i 'm not used to it , i 'm not ready for it ... you know ... i have never been so upset in my life . sandro , why do n't you help me ?

i 'm sorry about last night . please forgive me .

i ... i do n't know ... i did n't think it was worthwhile ... she was laughing over it ...

would you please see if sandro is with him ? he 's not in his room . i 'm sorry to disturb you .

what do you mean by sensible ?

but then why did you bother changing ?

to do what ?

calm ? ... he does n't seem so to me ... he was awake all night .

have you ever been in love ?

tell me , claudia , what do you think of raimondo ?

and tell corrado , too , that i 'm here ... if he wants me . you can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad , and that at this moment , it 's the only thing that interests me . is that clear ?

they 're all nudes , if i 'm not mistaken .

please , you come too ...

really ! so that you can stuff it with your geraniums .

corrado , why do n't you ask them to give it to us as a gift ?

do you know why ? because if you saw those ruins i 'm sure you would have said they were very , very beautiful . you always say `` how beautiful '' to everything -- whether it 's the sea , or a baby , or a cat ! you have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything .

at one time the aeolian isles were all volcanoes .

there too ...

i 'm going ashore to take a look around the island . there are some ruins up there ...

listen , marshal ... as for there being reasons for going away , anyone of us might have three thousand of them . so you can assume that she had them . what i want to know , is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard ?

i was saying ... it might even be possible that anna had left with them .

it would n't really do you any harm to skip a meal .

and who is this ?

ask her .

but i want to paint you . you appeal to me more .

what other boat ?

and who is she ? does she work in catania ?

i tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you .

you know , i do n't love anybody .

patrizia , do n't start in again ... i would rather be called depraved . unless you happen to love children .

yes ... of course ... but you should also print that in your paper ... but right away , tomorrow morning ... it 's the local palermo paper , is n't it ? ... i mean , it 's widely read ...

oh ... i 'm sorry i have to rush but i 've got to write a story about this thing that just happened ... tell me exactly how it all turned out .

how many times have i burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice , that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of .

i burnt them .

in the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins .

yes mother .

no i do n't ... the host is enough .

you 've got to eat something agnes .

i 'm not hungry .

why ?

what did you do ?

she ... left me alone with that little thing , and i looked at it , and i thought this is a mistake . but it 's my mistake , not mommy 's . god 's mistake .

it was alive was n't it ?

yes .

go away , i do n't want you here .

are you ill ?

you do n't like brussel sprouts ?

may i open my eyes now ?

i 'm not mistake , i 'm here are n't i. how can i be a mistake if i 'm really here . god does n't make mistakes , you 're a mistake ...

you 're a mistake .

agnes , you 're ugly ! ... what do you say ? of course you do . agnes , you 're ugly ! ... what do you say ?

yes .

yes ?

how ?

she can .

agnes ...

but you 're troubled ... are n't you ?

if you 're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and did n't want me but that 's not true , she was a good woman , a saint ...

if you did want one , how 'd you go about getting one ?

why not ?

she knew what was going to happen to me . that 's why she hid me away .

what things ?

oh , i 've got to give up smoking . agnes ... wait a minute ... agnes slow down .

she said all of god 's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could . i liked that .

why should i ?

i ca n't have them any more .

would you like some ?

no .

would you like to ask them ?

down ... there .

i do n't know .

where do you meet ?

and you like that ?

well do you love ... do you love father martineau ?

first thing that comes to your mind ?

what would you like to talk about .

no i 'm not .

you have a lovely voice .

hello . i 'm doctor livingston . i 've been asked to talk to you . may i ?

martha , all we 're saying is , no-one wants this to come to trial , not the church , not the crown ... least of all me .

hello , mama ... brought you something .

your mother was a resident of saint catherines home before you moved her .

what happened to the baby ?

she ca n't remember .

i doubt that 's what she 'd say .

that 's what i have to believe ...

this is insane .

how ?

stop laughing , i do n't say it 's the truth , i 'm saying ...

my god , you 're as crazy as ...

there are no saints today . good people yes , but extraordinarily good people ... those i 'm afraid we are sorely lacking .

i did n't tell you because i did n't think it was important .

your niece !

yes .

visitors to the convent .

answers .

innocence . legal innocence . i know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court .

? ? ? ... virginity , right mother ? poverty , chastity and ignorance is what you live by .

how dare you tell me to run my affairs !

i have n't said anything against the the catholic church .

i hate ignorance and stupidity .

what ?

but she did n't ... did she . if anyone had seen what i 'd seen she 'd be public property ... newspapermen , psychiatrists , ridicule . she does n't deserve that .

and you were n't shocked ?

shortly after she came to us .

no-one knew about agnes ' pregnancy . no-one . not even agnes .

you do n't really believe something like that happened do you ?

that she was unconscious , yes ! so someone easily could have come in the room and killed the ...

from other people ! i believe she is not crazy , nor is she lying .

father martineau , but i do n't see him as a candidate .

yes , but i ...

no , ginger , eddy fallon and ding dong .

nine .

well ! a boy of your age bowling < u > '' hoop '' < /u > at people . how old are you anyway ?

sure .

oh , yes , now i 'm with you . [ he changes his accent ] but , gee , mister , i 've got my license to think of ... we 're doing a hundred now ...

he does n't like me , honest , i can tell ... it 's 'cos i 'm little .

she 's a drag . a well-known drag . we turn the sound down on her and say rude things .

of course i can .

yes , he 's filled his head with notions seemingly .

you crawler .

what 's up ?

gerron .

i 'll look in here again .

come on , auntie , you 're winning .

no , hang on , i 've not gone daft . you see , when i was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery . when i 'd done she said to me , `` go and give some to the other kids . '' so , i said i would but i thought to meself , `` she must think i 'm soft . '' anyroad , i was eating away there but i wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end i wound up giving it all away ... but i did n't mind , mind , 'cos i 'd made the stuff in the first place . well ... that 's why you need other people ... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee , like . eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me ?

what of ? look , i would n't do it unless i was . i 'm dead lucky 'cos i get paid for doing something i love doing .

you do n't half slam the door in people 's faces , do you ? i mean , what about when you 're playing the part , like , hundreds of people 'll see you and ...

you 're living , are you ? when was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy ? when did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare ?

with a trombone hooter like yours it 'd be unnatural if you did n't .

yeah ... so what ?

what are you doing there ?

that 's all right then .

so 's mine .

like what ?

will you stop it ! sorry to disturb you , miss ...

give 'em a pull .

eh , he 's a nice old man , is n't he ?

you 've got a midnight matinee .

they 're nearly ready for you . they 're just finishing the band call .

oh shurrup and come on john . they 're waiting for you in the studio .

well , you should n't have had bacon for your breakfast , you cannibal .

no , you ca n't . look , as soon as i tell you , run through this door here and into the big car that 's waiting .

what have you heard ?

my eyes are lighter .

you are .

well ...

i 've got the stuff . come here .

have < u > you < /u > lost him ?

y'what ?

and ?

oh dear , i feel like doing a bit of work .

sorry .

paul 's grandfather .

i 'm sorry norm , but i ca n't help being taller than you .

well ... if he 's your grandfather , who knows ?

i 've got a little list here . wandering abroad . malicious intent . acting in a suspicious manner . conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace . you name it , he 's done it .

dell , what 's the last thing you can remember ?

engines off .

< u > oh god it hurts so bad < /u > !

breathe deeply .

yeah , i 'm okay . have n't hit bottom yet . definitely a column of warm air rising ; it keeps the shaft clear of dust .

can we come up ?

well , the sun just came up again , and it seems the wind 's died down . it 's as clear as a bell outside . there 's something i think you ought to see .

chaz , this is dell . can you come topside for a minute ?

appears to be a door hanging open , the entrance is clogged with debris .

is it solid ?

activated . vertical drop checked . correcting course . on tangential course now , orbiting . crossing the terminator . entering night side .

dell , i want greater magnification . more surface detail . i want to see what this place looks like .

just short of zeta ii reticuli . we have n't even reached the outer rim yet .

that way .

you know what they make this stuff out of ?

you like this shit ?

right . talk to you .

how long to fix ?

boy do i feel a lot better . it 's a straight shot back to the colonies , and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt . any bets on the top bid ?

we could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship . that would kill it .

god , that smoke 's poisonous !

we do n't know what might happen if we tried to kill it . at least right now it 's keeping him alive .

we ca n't expect to understand a life form like this . we 're out of our back yard . things are different here .

where did it come from ?

yeah ... well , maybe he should have . i mean , you brought the goddamn thing in here . maybe < u > you < /u > deserve to get slapped .

we 've got six hours left .

well , those things out there are n't the same , you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid . they 're from different cultures and different races . that ship just landed here -- crashed like we did . the pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous .

just keep your finger off the button till she 's way away from the ship , that 's all .

it 's not going to work .

you mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him ?

hey ! what about the film ?

what 's happening up here ?

i 've completely lost their signal .

now what 's wrong ?

all right , then -- when it gets to the other side of the door , you sing out , then drop the door . okay ?

i 've got hunter ... and something else as well , in front of him .

time and space have no meaning out here . we 're living in einsteinian equation .

i thought i 'd find you here .

i 'm going to write a book about this expedition . i 'm going to call it `` the snark log . ''

primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment , and this can be used as a starting point for translation ...

that sounds a little fanciful ...

help me -- i 'm going to try to get it off .

i could n't make it out -- too much interference .

sorry . nothing but that same damn transmission , every 32 seconds . i 've tried every frequency on the spectrum .

that tube must be depositing it in him .

men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe . this is an opportunity which may never come again .

no good ... it 's eaten too much of me ...

but i can save you -- get you to the autodoc !

look ...

and you stand aside while we drive it in , then shut the hatch , launch the boat , and --

it 's stable ; it does n't hurt to drop it .

here , carry these .

but the idea 's good , if we could just turn it around somehow .

this is all the same creature . we 're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle .

that next thing there -- six legs , tentacles -- that 's the thing we saw in the food locker .

well ... yes ... there 's a pattern ... but it 's meaningless to me .

can you make out any pattern in all that ?

nothing .

right now let 's keep it closed .

now what ?

i guess we open the door and net it .

now what ?

these will be very useful . at least we wo n't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands . all right , here 's the battle plan : we 're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship . whoever finds it first , catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock . clear ?

take us up .

chaz -- what happened to broussard ?

well ... it 's obviously intentional ... some kind of attempt at communication ... maybe it 's a symbol that means something to them ...

find anything we missed ?

it appears to be some sort of spacecraft . we 're going to approach it .

found what ?

yeah , rock particles . dust .

computer , you have signalled a priority three message . what is the message ?

let 's hear it .

can i ... um ... have some water ? please ?

i told you we ... what 's that ?

thanks .

i ca n't reach her . too much signal break-up .

cassie , thank christ ! we 're under attack .

it 's on the board .

marsco went belly-up on the dow jones .

we 've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet . it 'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go .

what ?

take a look at this .

i dunno .

where does that lead to ?

appreciate that .

right . auto-shop , you all set ?

let 's just run through it one more time so i know you 've got it straight .

what ? why ?

done it already . nothing matches .

that 's what we thought .

four .

i just ... wanted to be put on my own for a while . clear my head .

you should hit the sack , too .

very well . i shall drop you and go on to the party . i have no intention of missing it ...

max has gone to a great deal of trouble , it 's going to be an elaborate party , and it 's for you .

i wo n't play tonight . i could n't . not possibly . i could n't go on ...

belong - to you ? that sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama ...

what do you mean by that ?

not with me , you 're no champion . you 're stepping way up in class .

i still do n't know what you 're getting at . right now i want to take my nap . it 's important that i-

i never intended you to be .

it is possible - even conceivable - that you 've confused me with that gang of backward children you 've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them ?

what do you take me for ?

you sat and talked until it was light ...

she does n't know .

i 'm in love with lloyd !

addison ...

that 's for tonight . you 're invited . we 're having everyone up after the performance .

you could sleep , too , could n't you ?

plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night ...

are you that sure of tomorrow ?

i confide in you and rely on you more than anyone i 've ever known ! to say a thing like that now - without any reason - when i need you more than ever ...

just like that , eh ?

i can wait . where would you like to go ? we 'll make this a special night ...

- perhaps more than one . there 's so much i want to know . i 've heard your story in bits and pieces ... your home in wisconsin , your tragic marriage , your financial attachment to margo - it started in san francisco , did n't it ? i say - your idolatry of margo started in san francisco , did n't it ?

she may be later than you think ...

margo .

hear , hear ...

of course i knew .

i distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list . what are you doing here ?

you 've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me ... margo , tell me what 's behind all this .

i wish it were .

do n't be condescending .

it 's time you found out . i love you . i love you . you 're a beautiful and intelligent woman- - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress- - at the peak of her career . you have every reason for happiness- - every reason , but due to some strange , uncontrollable , unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid- - kid like eve to turn you into a hysterical , screaming harpy ! now once and for all , stop it !

- shows up for an audition when everyone knew i 'd be here ... and gives a performance ! out of nowhere - gives a performance !

i will not calm down !

okay . mix .

addison- !

the kid - junior , that is - will be right down . unless you 'd like to take her drink up to her ...

i do n't think that 's funny !

looks like i 'm going to have a very fancy party ...

this is my house , not a theater ! in my house you 're a guest , not a director- !

that i am ...

like a nylon lemon peel-

oh well ... ... look through the wigs , maybe it got caught-

you think ?

do n't run away , bill .

is that what you want me to be ?

- after all , the other day was one scene , the woods are full of one scene sensations . but you did it . with work and patience , you 'll be a fine actress . if that 's what you want to be .

you did n't have to tell me .

every day .

i read george jean nathan every week .

eighty percent of it will go for taxes .

why you have to go out there .

eve . eve harrington .

a diamond collar , gold sleeves - you know , picture people ...

but she just got here ...

well , i certainly think it 's odd he has n't even come up ...

the caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres- voila .

well ?

when we get home you 're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours .

she , too , is a great admirer of yours .

miss coonan ...

i do n't care if i never get home .

with changing and everything , a little over an hour .

that spilled drink is going to ruin your carper .

about how you live , what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that . you know the eve harrington clubs - that they 've got in most of the girls ' high schools ?

what report ? to whom ?

you probably wo n't believe me .

how did you get in here ?

what are you doing here ?

well . i think you 're painting the picture a little darker than it is , really . if nothing else - and do n't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in addison .

the reason is margo and do n't try to figure it out . einstein could n't .

you wo n't forget it ?

i think she would cheer .

some hollywood movie star , her plane got in late .

i think i 'd better . it 's been - well , i can hardly find the words to say how it 's been ...

well ...

my husband ...

it 's been a real pleasure , eve .

i 'd like anything miss channing played ...

why not ?

hello , miss channing .

- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man .

they are lovely . are n't they lovely , birdie ?

well , you 've done so much ... what 's new ?

when he gets too close , i 'll spit in his eye .

i could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-

the four of you must have so much to say to each other - with mr. sampson leaving ...

no , do n't go ...

there are other plays ...

well . if i did n't come to see the play , i would n't have anywhere else to go .

you 'll be there , wo n't you .

i ca n't believe eve said those things !

how much time have we ?

would you like a drink ? it 's right beside you ...

you 've what ?

i find these wisecracks increasingly less funny ! 'aged in wood ' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-

have you forgotten about eve ? what she is , what she 's done ?

the cynicism you refer to , i acquired the day i discovered i was different from little boys !

all this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named dewitt ! she apologized , did n't she ?

you 've got to admit it would be a novelty .

if we could cast it properly , that is ...

i wonder why .

eve .

i do n't think i could be .

that depends .

she is a louse .

do n't be evasive .

we are ready with your call to beverly hills ...

i said i 'm a dying man !

i did n't hear you .

who am i to threaten ? i 'm a dying man .

promise .

a couple of weeks .

-- sloan told the grand jury -- he answered everything they asked him -- that means there 's a record somewhere --

same as magruder , i do n't like it when they turn out to be human .

-- that cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the democrats -- five guys had control --

could have won him a fraternity paddle with a white house seal . god knows it worked .

you asking would i have been one of the president 's men ? i would have been .

segovia begged me for me secret but i said , `` no , andres , you 'll have to try and make it without me . ''

if he self-destructed .

-- because a year before , the republicans were n't ahead , not in the polls , muskie was running ahead of nixon then . before he self- destructed .

that 's what we 've got to find out , but segretti went to southern cal . and so did a bunch of nixon men --

-- almost every source we 've used has been republican , this guy 's a card- carrying democrat .

nixon .

we understand your problem --

and that something 's got to be more than just hunt , liddy , and the five burglars -- those indictments are gon na be bullshit when they come down . what else do we know ?

were you eyebrow reading ?

-- fifteen phone calls --

july of '71 .

you think they are confidential ? i do n't know anything about how this town works , i have n't lived here a year yet .

-- a spy , you mean ?

you heard ? they put us both on the break-in thing . simons liked the way we worked together . listen , i 'm sorry i said your story was bullshit .

mainly it has to do with your choice of words .

oh .

night .

11:30 .

-- almost a year before he left the justice department --

i never could figure just who this dahlberg was . think it might be anything ?

i 'd really like to see mr. dardis .

it gets interesting if it was haldeman , because our word is that when chapin says something , he 's gotten the ok from haldeman , and when haldeman says something , he 's gotten the ok from the president .

you 're the fella who forgot he rented a hertz car , do i have to tell you they did n't forget to send us the bill ?

down to miami and back -- how much damage can i do ?

i 'm the one sent you to toronto , bernstein --

there 's always a later plane .

it 's right under that pile .

give me your checkbook then .

i think .

you 're two months behind -- you got enough to cover ?

this girlfriend of mine at the committee , the other day she went back to the d.a . to tell the things the fbi did n't ask her . that night , her boss , he knew what she 'd done . they control everything ; that 's how they know it all .

this is practically a high school reunion for us , jane -- i would have sprung for a classier place .

think sloan 's being set up as a fall guy for john mitchell ? sometimes it looks that way .

so tell me about the times article .

-- if we wrote a story that said haldeman controlled the fund ? --

we 're moving . i 've been looking for a job but it 's been ... hard . my name 's been in the papers too much . sometimes i wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence . i 'm not thinking of myself . but my wife , my parents , it 's been very rough on them .

then barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to liddy who gave it back to me and i put it in the office safe which was crammed .

i will not talk about the other two .

well , they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel . and that could only mean the burglars did n't arrange for their own counsel -- they never even made a phone call . so if they did n't ask for you to be here , how did you know to come ?

douglas caddy , the attorney of record , when questioned about his presence in the courtroom , denied he was in the courtroom , `` i 'm not here , '' mr. caddy said .

someone with authority i 'd imagine , would n't you ? do n't you know what you 're onto ? come on .

did you change cabs ? it did n't work , something moved there --

the slush fund at creep financed the ratfucking , we 've almost got that nailed down , so --

where ?

-- i 'm woodward .

lotsa hints --

... go on , go on ...

you call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local democratic headquarters -- tell me , harry , why should i be smiling ?

-- political , personal , sexual , anything at all against mitchell ? --

that was awhile ago .

could develop .

larry young , a california lawyer --

-- which young ?

-- can we use their names ? --

-- and it was n't ehrlichman or colson or the president .

we 're not sure we 've got all the guys who could order you , but we know there were five .

does `` they '' mean the white house ?

hi . i 'm bob woodward of the washington post and i hate to bother you at home --

-- thanks , coach --

you have to pay attention to a girl . be sensitive to her feelings . relationships are reciprocal .

uh ... you know , my friends call me nova -- as in casanova .

sure .

... nevermind . you have anything to drink ?

first of all , it 's < u > mocha < /u > ccino , and secondly ... oohhhh !

what do you suppose they 're saying ?

uh-huh .

oz , it 's okay , i know .

you -- oh , you mean -- yeah , east lansing and ann arbor .

ah , he 's always too heavy on the vinegar . if you really want a good one , you got ta let me make it .

hi ...

come on ! i wo n't tell .

well the same things you do . hang out with friends and stuff , you know , whatever . what do you think i do ?

yeah ... so like , what else < u > do < /u > you do ?

really ? hey , thanks -- heather , right ?

well , if you want to get her in the sack , tell her you love her . that 's how i was duped .

no .

fuck me ! yes !

no , no that 's fine . so you doing okay ?

yeah ? well come prom night , those excuses are n't going to do you much good .

did i miss anything ? !

pontificated .

you can crash at stifler 's ?

finch , you got the latin homework ?

oh , no , not too much of a bookworm . he 's a good little kid . er , guy . man .

son . this lady 's here for you .

yes dad .

what the heck is this ?

cool ! we 're gon na have so much fun ! it 's like this one time , at band camp ...

i thought so . because , one time ? i was at this --

yeah , that 's pretty much it .

hang in there , buddy , you 'll get there .

i still think you 're okay .

you can do that ?

bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce , another runner in the night , blinded ...

yeah -- hey , did you see the little mermaid on tv the other night ? that ariel , whew .

did you see that central chick ? brunette ?

no ... you ... go ... ahead .

yes .

oh no , stifler , what did you do ?

ho-lee shit .

kevin ... you 're not your dad . the two of us , we 're not your parents .

i did n't say that . i mean , love , it 's like a term that gets thrown around . people say things , they get married , have kids , and then what ? it 's like they call it off , going `` i was wrong . ''

yes --

shhhh . your parents are downstairs .

i think `` shithead '' really says it .

what 's that ?

just dial 976-asshole .

okay , explain .

observe .

contact , dude .

i 'll bet you do , you little horndog , she 's givin ' you fuckin ' stiffies , right ?

< u > yeah < /u > !

depends if my date wants to stop by .

nova ! !

what , all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law ?

a-duh ... you 're a werewolf . and we , as your victims , have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted .

what a coincidence , i am someone ! mmm . calvin klein 's obsession . now it 's mine too .

did n't even have to ask .

i know where he 'll go .

yeah . french fries ...

you two faced bastard . i knew you were full of shit .

so 's woody allen . no , your uncle really helped me . i was sort of messed up for a while . wasting my time just partying and ... just stupid shit . he kind of woke me up , gave me a job , got me taking classes . you know , he and claude , their work is controversial , but they 're serious about it . totally dedicated .

do n't you want to change ?

come on serafine . let 's go out . show me the real paris , the part that is n't overpriced and overrun with german tourists .

in an underground club ? i 'd like to see that .

if you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up . now i must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords . he was security crazy .

sure . i can follow that .

you ? you 're madame flocquet ? i pictured a fat lady with an apron , not - i do n't know - la femme nikita .

serafine flocquet . i work for your uncle .

there 's something down there ! a bear or something ! a god damn monster ! beau coup teeth ! huge , grande , with yellow eyes , all this hair , it killed serafine ! my god ...

okay , what the hell are you up to ?

what 's the problem ?

merde ... wait here . when i return you tell me about last night , huh ?

this is ... it 's like a sick joke , i -

what ? !

uncle terrence .

yeah ?

oh shit ! no ! andy , do n't let them take me back there !

great , but listen , i need to know where you hid the adm ?

andy ? andy is that you ?

but this is class kid , all the way . what a way to go .

not that i know .

well , here 's what i think happened . a chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night . why ? perhaps he 's making a few francs on the side . the psychedelic drug market is big these days . he gets mixed up with a bad crowd and , like they say , if you lie with dogs , you get fleas .

okay . so he 's weird . maybe on drugs . still , that 's not -

yes sir .

hmmph . at least now there 's one person around here who does n't think i 'm crazy .

anya ! what if < u > we < /u > ca n't find anyone who loves us ? !

are you running away ?

oh , meetoo ! you look miserable ! oh , vlad - look at him !

we have to prepare you for an audience with sophie .

good day !

no ! i thought you believed in me ! it was all a lie !

i 'm sorry .

i know i must have had something to do with the palace - i 've had little flashes of things - but being the princess ? it does n't matter as long as i find my home .

it 's so beautiful ... and sad .

it 's the best fork of all

sorry - it 's a reflex . living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging .

i do n't know . i do n't see what this has to do with me .

who are you ? !

and this is my future . this is who i am !

me ? no . rich food - it kills me . ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces ?

bartok ... have you ever been to paris ?

trust me , it 's her !

oh my god ! do n't do that ... feel my heart . go ahead . i 'm dying here ...

dmitri ... you must understand that once you take her to tatiana ... well , it 's over ... nothing can happen between you . she 's a princess and you 're a commoner .

how is our current financial status ?

well , she certainly has a mind of her own .

ew . . . the honest type .

so . you do n't want to go to the coronation , eh ?

promise me she 'll have her home .

that last night in the palace ... one boy showed us kindness and courage . you were the boy who saved our lives , were n't you ? please , is there nothing i can do to repay you ?

empress , no ! i will not take the money ! i just came to tell you i was sorry ...

what i < u > found < /u > your was your granddaughter !

rasputin ! you 're alive . . .

perhaps you could convince her ?

can i have your autograph ?

i need a large polo mallet !

what 's your name ?

yeah , earl warren ?

alvy .

i prefer not to , because ... look , they 're laughing at him . see , so what are yuh telling me-

what do you mean , next ?

if you must know , it 's a hectic time for tony . the grammys are tonight .

air miles , you know . i mean , you know what that does to my stomach ?

the usual , you know . uh , tryin ' t ' write . i 'm workin ' on a play . jesus . so whatta yuh saying ? that you 're not comin ' back to new york with me ?

we can always come back together again . because there 's no-there 's no problem . 'cause ... right .

yeah , my analyst thinks this move is keen for me .

remember that day ?

tsch , i know . a relationship , i think , is-is like a shark , you know ? it has to constantly move forward or it dies . and i think what we got on our hands is a dead shark .

yeah , she 's got a great-lookin ' fa- a pat on the androgynous side . but it 's ...

yeah , i know it 's sick , but it 's new . you know , you did n't say it could n't be sick .

i do n't know , though , i feel so guilty because alvy is paying for it , so , you know , so i do feel guilty if i do n't go to bed with him . but if i do go to bed with him , it 's like i 'm going against my own feelings . i do n't know i-i ca n't win .

hey , can yuh watch the road ? watch the --

yeah .

i 'm sorry . i had the television set had the television-

i mean was there another- i thought i heard a voice .

i got the good chocolate , alvy .

my god , i mean , you know how i am about insects .

yeah , yeah , yeah , you . because in the dream ... i break sinatra 's glasses .

me ? i'm-i 'm one of the few males who suffers from that , so , so ... you know .

m 'm .

yeah ?

it 's his name .

next thing you know he 'll find you keen and peachy , you know ? next thing you know he 's got his hand on your ass !

we 're not having an affair . he 's married . he just happens to think i 'm neat .

following is different . i was spying .

yeah .

well , the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine .

no , no , no , what ... you can once , you can live without it once . come on .

well , i 'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal . you can sleep through it .

oh , you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed ?

well , okay . well , listen , i 'm gon na get a cigarette , okay ?

then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like i was dumb or something ?

no-what , what ... ? i ... we live together , we sleep together , we eat together . jesus , you do n't want it to be like we 're married , do yuh ?

that 's right , and it 's got bad plumbing and bugs .

well , what does-what does that mean ? i do n't know what that is .

oh , yeah ?

m'hm .

those are the two categories ...

i 've a very pessimistic view of life . you should know this about me if we 're gon na go out , you know . i-i-i feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable .

no , that was the most fun i 've ever had without laughing .

good ? i was-

yeah , i'm-i'm-i 'm a wreck .

h 'm ?

yeah .

what ?

whatta you mean , a tad restless ? oh , my god , i mean , they hated me .

oh , no-i mean , i 'm just a-auditioning sort of at club . i don't-

you 're gon na sing ? do you sing ? well , no , it is n't no kidding ? this is my first time . oh , really ? where ? i 'd like to come . oh , no , no , no , no , no ! no , i 'm interested !

'cause i do n't like to get naked in front of another man , you know-it 's , uh ...

oh .

do n't be funny .

for yuh .

right ! where ?

oh , i 'm in her acting class .

oh , why-uh ... y-y-you got ta car ?

hi . oh , hi . hi .

well , then , w-who was ?

you know , i-i think ... if i could pry this door off ... we shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they do n't have legs . they do n't run around .

yeah . i 'm gon na get my ... i 'm gon na get my camera .

talk to him . you speak shellfish ! hey , look ... put it in the pot .

do n't give it to me . do n't !

if they 're only babies , then you pick 'em up .

yeah , 'cause it 's supposed to .

alvy .

`` why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories ? he said as he removed her brassiere ... ''

i mean that as a compliment .

tsch , a few .

well , that 's funny , because i happen to have mr. mcluhan right here . so ... so , here , just let me- i mean , all right . come over here ... a second .

without getting ... well , let 's put it this way ...

key word here is `` indulgent . ''

right before his un-american thing .

yeah , intensive care ward . my god-hey , max , i think she 's ... i think she 's giving me the eye .

oh , jesus .

give me a tremendous laugh here , charlie .

yeah , and always over the most ridiculous things .

no , i 'm not . we were walking off the tennis court , and you know , he was there and me and his wife , and he looked at her and then they both looked at me , and under his breath he said , `` jew . ''

they 're persecuted enough !

hey , listen-i mean , he was a terrific actor , and look at him , he 's neat- looking and he was emotional ... y- hey , i do n't think you like emotion too much .

no .

we went over to the swap meet . annie , gram and i. got some nice picture frames .

you 're fucking desperate .

october-ish .

well , i ca n't make any promises , and of course i have n't read the script but i loved the novel ... when are you shooting ?

the camera loves her . a great actress .

and you 've only just met .

the neighbors from hell . the kind that lay in wait . i 'd rather move actually . would n't i ? would n't i ?

what 's that ?

you can cut around it , whatever it is . you always do .

mac ? oh there you are . what are you doing , honey ? no more work . do n't you feel breezy .

you know sophia . she 's so damned judgemental . and she 's so damned ... perfect . and so fucking ... serene . just fucking do n't tell her . because you know mac thinks she 's god . and i can feel him comparing .

i 'm fine . i 'm fine . well , i 'm a little stressed . and i 've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby .

you look so well , clair . a wraith .

it 's not a contest .

happy anniversary . you 're a good match , you two . can you help me with this stuff ?

you 're not ready .

sally , for christ 's sake .

cal , too ?

it 's a novel .

yeah , let 's talk about that . you seem to be rather an expert . i do n't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties .

otis ! ! ! !

truce ?

well , not yet . the gate was open ?

okay . i 'm sorry , look , i meant to tell you . it was the only chance i had to meet her .

through the sweats or not ?

kiss the back of my knees .

happy anniversary .

still . well . let 's drop it .

thanks , i 'll take that . champagne ?

hey , i 'm happy for you , buddy . anything i can do .

and you got skye davidson . pretty big leagues for a first timer . do you even like movies ?

i 'm so sorry .

stop being such a bitch , sal .

i know you changed it to a bookstore . and the color of my hair . but the moment was exactly the same . the same , you know , dynamic . and almost verbatim , was n't it ?

you must have been a baby .

it 's really not the same thing . he was really nicer when he drank .

i will treasure this .

i 'll be your best friend .

very well put .

no you 're not .

sally did all this herself ?

this is an amazing present . what a sweetheart you are .

oh , i love that . i 'm just great . i 'm so happy to be here . and i apologize for invading you . and i 'm so happy you asked me to . i 'm so touched . i know how private you and sally are .

i did n't say a word .

do n't go in , ryan .

there 's only you , ryan . you know what , ryan ? you 're beautiful . i love you so much ... you need ...

i 'm sure you understand .

i so wish i 'd known .

oh ?

hi . monica and ryan ?

are you asking me to marry you ?

i just did a movie about bob yar , i played gittle , the jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head , and they used shostakovich 's 13th symphony .

the charades .

oh my god . i 've been so rude . i 'm skye davidson . has anyone ever told you , you look like peter sellers ?

we 're going to have to go back out there .

we 're just feeling our way back .

absolutely . you always wonder where your books end up . why do n't we use it ?

oh . well , yes . it 's extraordinary . you think you could sign it for us ?

but i am a possessive , fragile neurotic .

well , you were n't fine last summer when you went sylvia plath on me in connecticut .

you do n't have kids to keep a marriage together , sally . it 's only five months since joe came back .

neither does joe .

i do n't have a drug problem .

well , are you sure about this baby thing ? it 's not the ticking clock shit , is it ?

oh honey , let 's .

you 'll hate it in london . it 's wet and miserable . a medical hellhole sally . it 's socialized . beds in the corridors . terrible plumbing .

but she really gets to the heart of joe , does n't she ? she 's a genius .

a notch above the storage room .

it 's much more personal in here .

hmm . where are my kids ?

ah .

no , z. the squeaky wheel gets < u > thrown < /u > < u > away < /u > , alright ? you 're a good ant , z , even though you are a pain in my rear- segment . i do n't wan na see anything happen to you . so quit mouthing off , before you get in trouble .

sorry azteca . here you go , fellas ! fresh dirt ! alley oop ! should n't we be wearing gloves ? i mean this dirt is very ... dirty . does n't anyone think of hygiene ? boy am i hungry . i 'm so hungry i 'm seeing double . it looks like there 's < u > two < /u > million ants in here . when 's lunch ? tomorrow , or the day after ?

invisible !

tell me about it .

hey , slow it down , big boy . you 're making the rest of us look bad ... how come i have n't seen you around here before ?

it 's a shame he died prematurely ... i was hoping to kill him myself .

he 's ... he 's dead . you do n't have to look for him anymore . he was eaten by a praying mantis .

a < u > few < /u > ?

come on , z .

well ... no , but --

this lake is huge ! and so close to the colony ! think of the vacation potential !

worker ! come back here now !

i 've been kidnapped by the village idiot .

excuse me , i -- pardon me -- and they call them social insects .

alright , alright , i 'll try to get directions from one of the locals .

oh my god , it 's you ! you 're a worker ! ! ! a filthy , stupid , disgusting worker !

ah , yes . well , charmed , i 'm sure . so , princess , have you ever danced with a hero ?

you 're the hero of the recent termite campaign , are n't you ?

of course --

who is that idiot ?

yes ... he 's wonderful ...

i felt the same way before i got married . confused . scared .

it 's just that -- well , i 'm honored that you selected me , and everything , i just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation ?

z ! over here !

do n't be scared , kid . barbatus 's got yer back .

superior numbers , kid !

desperate times call for desperate measures . get me ant team six .

may i cut in ?

affirmative .

well , i generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death 's back . so , tell me , fellow war-monger ... do you think princess bala likes men in uniform ?

one to nothing !

they should be ... but there 's something funny about that soldier .

yes , general formica . carry on , my good man ! i do n't know what we would do without you .

yes , what else ?

i ca n't think of any .

what 's gon na go wrong ? ! i take your place for the royal inspection . bala comes strolling down the line , she sees me -- < u > bingo < /u > ! love is rekindled , and she takes me up to the palace for a little ... tea and crumpets ... and you take your place again , and go march around to your heart 's content !

i mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night ?

this the place ?

yes , mrs. dreyfuss . he starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two . fran is just sitting there , the spoon in her hand , not touching the soup .

are n't you meeting mr. sheldrake ?

i know . i suppose you heard about mr. sheldrake -- ?

so i want you to keep a clear head .

i do n't ?

a what ?

thank you .

yes . i was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress .

i think you should . i have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that 's left around here is one frozen pizza -- i 'll be right back -- okay ?

i do n't want to talk to him .

can i have that pad and the pencil ?

oh . i can type up a storm , but i ca n't spell . so they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that 's how i met jeff -- oh , god , i 'm so fouled up . what am i going to do now ?

too slow ?

why do people have to love people , anyway ?

i think i 'm going to give it all up .

i 'm not very good at it .

miss kubelik , i do n't think you ought to call anybody -- not till that chewing gum is out of your head .

my sister -- she 'll want to know what happened to me .

who are you calling , miss kubelik ?

that 's right . i told you we had a fight -- that 's what it was about -- miss olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --

how many of those drinks did you have ?

by the power vested in me , i herewith declare this elevator out of order . shall we join the natives ?

what gave you that idea ?

marry christmas .

i know your height , your weight and your social security number -- you had mumps , you had measles , and you had your appendix out .

oh .

no . like a man .

i thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --

i hope everything goes all right .

i sort of like it .

what did you do to your hair ?

morning , miss kubelik .

do n't worry about dr. dreyfuss -- i happen to know he was out on a case .

what you get from renting to bachelors . all night i did n't sleep ten minutes -- and i 'm sure you woke up dr. dreyfuss .

all that marching -- tramp , tramp , tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe ?

no i did n't .

you know that other key to your apartment -- well , when we had that little scare about miss kubelik , i thought i 'd better get rid of it quick -- so i threw it out the window of the commuter train .

oh ?

i did n't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who i mean -- i found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills .

put me down for thursday again .

sir ?

the mirror is broken . it was broken when i found it .

you know my secretary -- miss olsen --

oh , no sir . certainly not . anyway , it 's none of my business -- four apples , five apples -- what 's the difference -- percentage-wise ?

you know how people talk .

swap them ? for what ?

no , sir . i 'm not going to deny it . but if you 'd just let me explain --

that 's very flattering .

yes , sir .

fran been sick or something ?

look , buddy-boy -- if there was n't a lady present , i 'd clobber you .

how do you do , mr. matuschka ?

a lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice . what is she trying to prove ?

yes , mr. kirkeby . you still owe me for the last two bottles --

mr. sheldrake ?

mr. kirkeby , i do n't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight .

you threatening me ?

that 's a shame . i 'll send the key right down . and about your promotion -- -- i 'm sending that efficiency report right up to mr. sheldrake , in personnel . i would n't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over .

look , baxter -- we 're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and i 'm putting you in the top ten . now you do n't want to louse yourself up , do you ?

i hate to disappoint you -- i mean , many happy returns -- but not tonight --

no , thanks -- i do n't feel like it . look , doc -- in case i do n't see you again -- how much do i owe you for taking care of that girl ?

yeah -- i 'm giving up the apartment .

yeah , was n't i ?

these cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient . i ought to charge you by the mile .

mister -- miss -- such politeness !

hello , miss kubelik .

fran , i 'm a doctor . i 'm here because you took too many sleeping pills . do you understand what i 'm saying ? fran , i 'm dr. dreyfuss -- i 'm here to help you . you took all those sleeping pills -- remember ?

let me get my bag .

nothing . just clear out , will you ?

what 's the matter ? did i do something wrong ?

not so rough , honey .

mrs. macdougall , i think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot .

still stuck on her , huh .

she may be a girl -- but she 's no friend of mine .

no .

mickey ? he would n't do nothing like that . he 's a jockey . they caught him doping a horse .

who is mickey ?

you know , that big-shot down in cuba with the crazy beard .

mr. baxter -- nineteenth floor .

dr. dreyfuss .

because i took some sleeping pills . but i 'm all right now -- so let 's go .

i know it 's a drag -- but you ca n't find a hotel room in town -- not on new year 's eve .

it wo n't always be like this . i love you , fran .

sure . monday and thursday -- and monday again -- and thursday again --

do n't forget to kill the lights . see you monday .

okay . i just thought as long as it was paid for --

i have a present for you . i did n't quite know what to get you -- anyway it 's a little awkward for me , shopping -- -- so here 's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something .

well , that 's more like it . at least you 're speaking to me .

fran --

i saw my lawyer this morning -- i wanted his advice -- about the best way to handle it --

no . i have a date at eight-thirty .

a little mixup in signals . let 's go .

a hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the bronx .

what 's the difference ? some schnook that works in the office .

hey , dad -- why do n't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive ?

you can keep your fucking fuel --

that 's what there is to talk about -- my man -- i take a good care of my men --

we need all our fuel anyway .

i like all of them --

who the hell are you ?

we do .

thirty -- sometimes fifty .

sometimes .

which part is that ?

sure . recoil ... i feel the recoil of my rifle .

that we 're dumber than we look .

i do n't know .

elevate lance , in the tree . no , i saw another .

will they attack ?

rocks , sand -- those two men who deserted .

get in there now or i 'll bury you in this river .

who knows what 's up there ?

the draft of that river might be too shallow on the point .

beats me -- the sun was too much for him , or the mud . who knows ?

'bout six months ago i took a man up to lo mung bridge . he was regular army too . shot himself in the head . i brought his body back down .

all right with me , i used to drive a taxi .

i never heard about that .

i only met kurtz once .

spooky .

we ai n't goin ' down the river .

how did they know ?

he was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war .

the vietnamese think it 's theirs -- i guess the americans do , too .

captain ?

attacks repulsed , as i was saying . this is only for this war , captain . viet cong -- 54 ; north vietnamese regular forces -- 15 ; south vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise . americain -- 6. of course , they were , perhaps , mistakes , captain .

yeah , i 'm an artist , goddamit !

the wind --

napalm , boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --

they far enough ?

that 's terrible -- we 'll change that -- i 'd like to see you work -- i 've always liked your cutback ; got a hell of a left turn , too .

where 've you been riding , lance ?

you can cut out the sir , lance -- i 'm bill kilgore -- i 'm a goofy foot .

big duke six to hell 's angels four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts .

we 'll come in low out of the rising sun -- we 'll put on the music about a mile out .

i mean it 's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance , boy -- i 've lost a few recon ships in there now and again .

no . they put out two or three for every one i needed . when you get to the one you 'll use , you just stake it out . if something feels wrong , you just pass it up . on one mission , i had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars .

i 'm taking you back .

my river ... my people ... my jungle ... my ideas ... my country ... my wife ... ... my death .

i had immense plans .

i 'm taking you back . you can still live .

oh captain , that is so true .

you know what you 're doing ? you are interfering with my plans !

you ca n't have water after morphine .

what other reason could you have come ? a captain . ranger . paratrooper . graduate of the recondo school . am i right about these things ?

yes i was ... he said his last words to me .

you knew him best .

and you admired him ?

sure .

no -- i do n't think so . but it 'll be back . they were circling . it 'll be back .

no -- no , captain .

nah .

i 'd just clear out as soon as i could if i were you , sir . they 're gon na start working on the bridge with torches again . charlie will start throwing it in hard --

who are you ?

no , colonel kurtz could n't be crazy -- if you heard him talk , just last week , you 'd never think he was crazy .

sounds like he 's gone crazy .

you 're australian ?

what things ?

may i ask where the captain is going in his little boat ?

i do n't know anything about these papers , sir .

215 continued :

you talk about ecology -- there it is .

89 continued :

see the blood ? pack of wolves took down a moose . greedy , gut-ripping sons of bitches . i 'd kill the last wolf on earth , right in front of the president of the u.s. stinking , cowardly predator , the wolf .

mind if i get some stuff from my kit ?

i 'd sure like that favor you offered a while back .

there is n't one , unless corbett 's men get here before the plane does .

back against the bars . now .

question is why they sat here when the storm moved in . check their stuff while i sniff around .

that 's why i left , moved to washington . when i met eric i was doing day shoots -- products and fashion , mostly . pretty dull . eric was teaching college , and then he got the job with northland oil . we wanted to stay together , so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography ... and here i am .

what about you -- why come back ? classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things .

ca n't be . too keen a sense of this place in your pictures .

six months .

how long have you been up north ?

i 've got an idea . we 'll have to work fast .

i 'm staying .

bastards took off , though , did n't they ?

be right back . i left my camcorder in the car .

let 's get out of here .



i 'm sure she 's fine . seemed like a clever kid .

maybe ... maybe not . i 'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life , like an ordinary jerk . that 's why i want to work on the front lines , where what i do means something . soon as i got here , i realized my job was bullshit . oil company propaganda . i was ready to leave , then i thought screw it , i 'll outsmart them , do the work anyway . i do n't know anymore . maybe i am fooling myself . that 's what i 'm afraid of most of all .

you do n't know how true that is .

nome ? i figure you 'd be a whaler , coming from there .

stay still .

it 's a spring day ...

stay awake ! you want to go hypothermic ?

you want to fool yourself about that bullshit job , fine . damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along . you think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man -more-

i 'm still figuring : you 're either real brave or real dumb .

you got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger ?

been driving long ?

smart ? sure . that 's why i 'm sitting in this plane and they 're down there blowing me kisses .

send him down to her . there 's money in my duffel bag , back at his cabin .

no big deal . we just got off on the wrong foot . what 's your name ?

i do n't want to hurt you , sam .

do n't try me . i 'll kill you if it comes to it .

sam , give dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit , will you ?

can we buy the marshal some dinner ?

relax . one more day without drink wo n't kill you . right , sam ?

just passing through .

i need to rent a cabin .

i should release corbett because you want some votes ?

... you give us a ride in the cessna you got hangared at the pumping station , we 'll be in fairbanks in a few hours .

bet i could make some money turning ben corbett in . maybe more for lettin ' him loose . i was up in my cache . saw the northland man come talk to you .

wilder 's missing church services ; you believe it ?

i 'm right fuckin ' here with you .

i ai n't gon na leave a seven- hundred-dollar remington behind .

there 's what they 're waiting on !

naah , wilder knows we got friends in town .

this is sam wilder , marshal in devil 's cauldron . had some killings here . i got a suspect ; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands .

once the tests come back , is there someone i can reach in your office for the results ?

how long has he been having problems ?

i 'm a waitress .

what ? please ? now ? tell me ? !

because ...

what are you doing here ?

were you asleep ?

i should 've danced with you .

i do n't .

do it then . get the dog picked up . i ca n't believe you let it stay there .

to hell with sex .

i 'll never forget you said it .

if you ask me ... i 'll say , `` yes . ''

tell me even if you 're scared . tell me why you wanted me here . it 's okay .

well , ah ... that 's a personal question .

i am so afraid you 're about to say something awful ...

just him and that 's it . okay , you can answer -- we 've worked it out .

okay , gotcha . what did you think i was going to ask ?

there 's ... there 's no need to bring anything dressy ... or ... i mean -- i did n't know if we 'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes .

the stiff one eye ?

just how grateful i am .

i 'm not kidding .

what needs clearing up ?

my son is sick , okay ?

last week i was playing the piano for him and he likes it , and so i decide i 'm going to make a little joke ...

spencer .

his name ?

clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she does n't hear me . listening to the story from the upset friend ... now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who does n't even say , `` thank you . '' no , the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it 's getting tougher to make believe .

good night .

our room . i do n't want to see him and he 's not going to come knocking on your door .

what a nice compliment .

no ... nervous . it would be very rough , carol , if you were n't along .

what the heck do you mean ?

shhhhhhh . i do n't have this mountain of available time ... i got to get to my restaurant on time . do you know how hard it is for me to be here ?

no , i promise ... not a chance . i own this guy . there was no one else . i 'm on the move too much . trust me .

okay ... so i 'll see you tomorrow . let 's not drag this out . we do n't enjoy another that much .

yeah . if his parents are alive they 've got to help -- those are the rules . good .

it 's not my dog and this simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off .

i 'm not saying nothing to you .

shhhh now . i like simon . i like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again . meanwhile , i 'll try and think how you can make this up to him . i hate doing this . i 'm an art dealer . have a nice day . party !

what i know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me , i do n't give a fuck what or where you shove your show . are we being neighbors for now ?

frank 's idea . he thought i should have notes so i did this right ... maintained focus , did n't get emotional and tried not to terrify you .

no . please , do n't force him .

how you doing , great one ?

where 'd they teach you to talk like this -- some panama city `` sailor want to hump-hump bar '' ? or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey . sell crazy some place else -- we 're all stocked up here .

how come you 're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause i do n't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole .

i forgot to lock the door .

what 's wrong ?

it was better than this ... look , you , i 'm very intelligent . if you 're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope , you got to be better than you 're doing . if you ca n't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up . i 'm drowning and you 're describing water .

i 'm a great guy -- `` extraordinary '' ... ... and she does n't want contact with me . i 'm dying here .

that 's very thoughtful .

let 's do the small talk in the car . load up .

well , i work all the time . so never , never again interrupt me . okay ? i mean , never . not 30 years from now ... not if there 's fire . not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there 's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you 're going to faint even then do n't come knocking or , if it 's election night and you 're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer president of the united states ... and he 's going to put you up in camp david and you just want to share the moment with someone ... do n't knock ... not on this door . not for anything . got me . sweetheart ?

well , that 's a load off .

mr. udall , i 'd like to talk to you please .

no . no . no . hey , that painting in there ... i just want to tell you ...

why are you doing this ?

how about that pose ? this is not fun ... give me some direction .

oh , yeah .

what does that fucking mean ?

okay , do n't .

what ? you think i 'm running you up ?

what restaurant ?

no , the other hotel paraiso , in the city . near the plaza del sol .

the contract ?

i know . it was a joke .

i 'm taking off my mike .

i know . that 's why i 'm attracted to you . i mean , you make me nervous . you 're intimidating . maybe it 's my curiosity/self-preservation thing , but all i can really think about right now is kissing you .

is this becoming complicated ?

someone like me , like you . a pro .

is that why you did n't want to talk about women before ?

i 'm playing white , remember . you ca n't tell me which pieces to move . it does n't work that way .

it 's always been that way . the world has always functioned on two levels .

five million dollars will buy a lot of rolaids .

ten years later , here you are again .

no . i went back to the hotel . and waited .

he wanted what i want now ; to get out of the business . to disappear to some empty greek island .

sounds pretty well figured out .

you 'll be here . a restaurant . a public place far enough away that he wo n't notice you , but with a good enough view you 'll be able to see him when he moves inside .

but he wo n't shoot you right then ?

cheap as shit .

in costa blanca .

i was n't expecting this . i need to think .

that 's where he 'll be .

mexico .

but you knew what they were training you for ?

you went from high school to the agency ?

i was just different .

where you wanted to be ?

rath . robert rath .

listen -- i do n't even know your name .

oh jesus jesus ...

because he took a contract on you . he 'll come for you and he 'll find you .

i do n't need the money .

yes .

why ?

he stole the contract knowing that i would come after him .

no . they hired bain . the contract would have been mine , but bain took it from me as he took the previous one .

you 're the computer hacker , you tell me .

i figure that means these are worth ten times that , maybe more .

twenty large ? that 's all ?

i 'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus .

right . in my hands i have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night .

yes .

but when you finlsh a job , afterwards do you think about them ?

why are you working today ?

why did n't you fade ?

anything .

do they get down on their knees , begging and crying ?

everyone handles it differently . some are ready , some are not .

that 's what our general contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that ?

why not ?

i do n't know , maybe i 'll enrol for postgrad ' studies next autumn .

i used to think he was right about a lot of things but now i do n't know . i thought he was going somewhere but now i think i am wasting my time .

42 56 76 ... ... ... okay , you wait at dave 's for my call tomorrow , if you do n't hear from me by three o'clock , send that note and get out of the country fast .

good , what 's his number ?

what do you want me to do ?

that bad ?

i do n't want to ruin your day .

hey jahn ... ..you got a name for this thing ?

shit no , it 'll be twice cost .

you might make henry happy ... ... sure , i 'll do it .

my god ! what happened ?

get me a couple of beers and a salami .

i see , you 've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine .

red or white ?

do you think anyone will really come here ?

we 're going to need it all .

yeah , her name 's kavlova , why ?

need any disks ?

sounds like a good reason to leave it alone .

i do n't know . this wall is n't like the rest though , it 's not all that old either .

yes , but it suddenly clicked , this is going to be a crazy place and , since the commies are used to seeking asylum , we can use that in the marketing .

nope , not even close . i 've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though .

good , i love swinging a shovel .

and if the police stop by - what do i tell them ?

a locksmith too ? why d'you ever bother with writing ?

i feel like a mole in this joint , so i guess i might as well come out lookin ' like one !

no , but like my dad said , `` there 's only so many ways you can wire a plug '' .

you got my word on it .

maybe , but someone 's got to make a stand .

what we need is a space for real performance art . a cultural exchange for radical expressionism .

that 's lubosh , the greatest fiddle player in prague . you must have seen him playing with johnny on the bridge . ... ... come on , let 's grab a table .

doug ?

sure , it 's on the red metro line you ... .

what ?

listen , doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you 're going .

i ca n't go with him .

yeah , no problem .

i 'm not hungry , really .

time for lunch i think . i 'll get the sandwiches . what would you like holly ?

i hope so !

will it help to get you out ?

i think i 'm stupid ... ..all you do is use me and expect me to wait for you .

we should go to the metro it 's quicker .

do n't worry it 's okay !

look kat it 'll only take ten minutes . without jahn i might never find it ... we 'll just have a quick look and then you and i 'll hit a tram .

no i 'm not , i came to prague looking for something - this could be it !

no thanks , i must go , but maybe you could get some beers for the guys .

yes , the obelisk but it 's closed for repairs .

you mean it 's started ?

no , it should be over soon .

why do n't we both forget about him ?

did you take your things over to my place ?

i 'll be okay , just get me home .

is it dry ?

i figured you more as a socialist ?

i 'll put one on the notice-board too .

not all of them !

yeah .

okay , okay , but i want it right back . it belongs to my father .

josh , i need your help . doug 's been arrested , he 's in big trouble . i thought maybe your father and the embassy might be able to do something .

can we talk in your office ?

josh , i have to speak you , it 's urgent .

it 's more than what you 're worth .

go to hell !

i do n't want to go .

well , for a start , you 've got to get cleaned up .

oh that 's it ? everything i do is crap !

all i 'm saying honey is run the thing past me for christ 's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap .

that was not my decision , i can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored . in the meantime no one else must know those files exist . secure the building and i will arrange alternative safe storage immediately .

the building has been occupied and the locks have been changed .

landon , honey . there 's nothing more .

i have no idea what to say . how to act . what if i do the wrong thing ?

mom , great . but what i want is for me to be proud of me .

a late night or an early morning ?

i ca n't know things if you do n't tell me .

-- i like the car i have .

later .

and that you 're scamming on jamie sullivan .

the address ? !

you 'll be fine for a few minutes .

it 's not that simple . it costs money to do this at home .

because you have hope that you 'll get better ?

tired .

i do n't want to come here anymore .

what are you going to -- ?

you 're worried about your college applications .

look . talk . not talk .

where ?

loved ?

it 's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know , spontaneously .

what ?

she great or what ?

when i have something to say .

you 're hardly nice to anyone .

you were great the other night .

yeah --

oh . just not at school ...

but you think about him -- it -- her .

you 're really into god , right ?

before voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --

that is my telescope .

i know . do n't say anything .

ambitious .

like me .

why ?

'they wo n't . '

i do n't make small talk --

he goes to my father 's church . he could 've died --

no . i want what 's best for you .

it 's time to tell him . it would be the right thing .

i saw the way he looked at you . the way he kissed you .

fine . but i need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life .

jamie , he 's careless . reckless . is this really the best time to be making a new friend ... ?

the carter boy . tell me about him .

either . both .

so talk to us about something .

landon . you 're not the quiet type .

apropos of nothing ... so . so so so so --

you 're welcome .

like you 'd make it to june . even cutting half your classes , you have a b- average .

what else ? what kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths .

where 's your old man ?

yes , sir !

listen , professor brown told me you called last night and gave me your message ...

marty , you have n't been listening . nobody 's asked me to the dance ... yet .

how could i forget ? oh , sure , i remember you .

you remember me ... ?

mom , how else are we gon na see the sunrise ?

how was school today ?

i was practicing . i 've got an audition next week -- i got ta practice . how am i gon na get famous if i do n't practice ?

maybe if i used my left ... .

'bike fine point ? '

christ , it 's a miracle i was even born !

what do i say ?

oh yeah .

run out of gas ?

yes , that 's my name . who are you , young man ? are you supposed to be here ?

what year ?

sir , it only costs a nickel .

what ? !

yeah , right .

no , no , not beyond an acceptable level . have you been x-rayed recently , martin ?

what , am i radioactive or something ?

what 's this all about ?

it 's the most beautiful city i 've ever seen ! what is it ?

but if you did n't rebuild the time machine , how did i go back in time in the first place ?

nope . my father 's never clenched a fist in his entire life !

professor , if something does go wrong tonight ... if i do n't get my parents back together ... when do you think i 'd cease to exist ?

it 'll be fine , marty . you 'll be fine . good luck . he stuck his hand out and marty shook it . but there was still a question that was nagging at him ...

that 's just what i needed to hear .

professor , be serious , would you ?

okay , professor , i get where you 're coming from . the way i look , the way i 'm dressed ... i 'd stick out like a sore thumb .

you answered the door !

4200 rads ... that certainly ca n't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age .

jeez -- this is where you used to live , huh ? you must have been rich !

uh , marty lewis ! i almost did n't recognize him -- have n't seen him in years .

he will be . simple inebriation , is all . the young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol ... something that runs in the family . you see , he 's a second cousin of mine on my mother 's side . came quite a distance to visit me , he added . his name 's lewis .

you know me ?

professor ? professor brown ?

a time machine ! because of that coke ? !

shemp is right here in this room ... two minutes from now , and at exactly 9:02pm , we 'll catch up to him .

now who 's being stupid ? the guy who runs this place .

uh , yeah ... gim me a tab .

you do n't mind ?

okay .

i know you do . good luck to you , too .

good luck to you .

you ever had to open it up like that before ?

long as my ammo held out ... right there 's where you caught me .

hi .

you know , before i met her , nobody could ask me how i was doing with my girl . matter of fact , i did n't really have one .

what ?

have you got a better idea ?

excuse me .

whatcha looking in there for ? we ca n't afford any of that .

he did n't say anything to me about it .

we better call the doctor ... listen . i 'll say how it happened , part i saw .

how bad off is he ?

is that all there is to it ?

my stomach 's growling .

and the flowers ... let 's not pick them . they 're so nice .

can i come around and see you tomorrow ?

yeah , but the thing about him , he 's down with the flu . he 's sick .

do n't worry , i wo n't let her drive .

november 1 , thirty days have september , april , june , and november ... when short february 's done , all the rest have thirty-one . october 31st ! halloween ! do n't you get it ? orson welles !

so we 'll help . let 's get crackin ' !

she got ta be kiddin ' , right ? vaporize the whole damn planet -- ?

it 's an antidote . a formula . whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises .

see 'em ? they about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast . broke my windshield ...

i think i 'm on to something . you and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called yoyodyne .

that 's me . i 've been ionized , but i 'm okay . i 'm , switching on the homing beacon , mark two minute intervals .

same one you had yesterday ?

i lack the authority , buckaroo banzai .

these antidote filters the professor 's whipped up will let you to see them like i have since yesterday , as arachtoidal creatures . they wo n't be pretty , nothing personal , john parker . but just remember ... if we fail tonight , there 's no tomorrow .

sure . i wo n't hold my breath .

i got ta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-i 've got mixed emotions-i do n't know if i can handle this . oh , boy ...

she was murdered by hanoi shan on our wedding night .

yes , i do . gim me a chance . i 'm stronger than you think .

she must 've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you ...

somewhere . see i was taken away by the priddies when i was a baby . i was adopted .

another 'you ' ?

no , i do n't .

the netherlands . whew , that 's a long way from wyoming .

i 'd turn around , but i 'm afraid you 'd strangle me .

i guess 'cause you remind me of someone i once knew , long ago before any of this craziness .

where was it , john o'connor ? how far back ?

what ? a black ship ? where ? a black thermopod 's been shot down ten miles back .

the name 's reno . this here 's perfect tommy .

i did n't drop 'em .

nothing , really . said he was in the insurance business .

... still , i must say . i have n't felt peace like this since the grand productive days . do n't you find it so , barton ? ai n't writin ' peace ?

he 's a great writer

jesus , what a day i 've had . ever had one of those days ?

nope , never watched any . i 'm not that interested in the act itself

beery ! you got no beef there ! he 's good . hell of an actor though , for my money , you ca n't beat jack oakie . a stitch , oakie . funny stuff , funny stuff . but do n't get me wrong beery , a wrestling picture , that could be a pip . wrestled some myself back in school . i guess you know the basic moves .

how 's about it , bart ?

do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone ?

i got a message on my machine to meet gus here . where is he ?

she knew you 'd find out who lisa henderson is . you 're a good cop -- what did she do ? tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant ? did she tell you in bed , nick ? that 's how i 'd do it .

i did dye my hair . it did n't have anything to do with her . i was a redhead for a while , too .

we were in some of the same classes .

it 's fucked -- now will you please tell i.a . that i 'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here ?

what do you want , nick ? flowers ? i 'll send you some flowers .

how did it end ?

i have to do some research tomorrow .

did you miss me ?

try me .

do you think i told her to kill you ?

do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets ? i do n't do those .

what did you think ?

no . i wrote it years afterwards .

say -- `` what do you want from me , catherine ? ''

my wife used to call me that .

fine .

only in theory . you know all about homicidal impulse , do n't you , shooter ? not in theory -- in practice .

you know all about me .

how do you know all this stuff about me ?

if i were guilty , and if i wanted to beat that machine , it would n't be tiring . it would n't be tiring at all .

yes , you do .

were you with him last night ?

exactly what do you have in mind , mr. corrigan .

there is no smoking in this building , ms. tramell .

no thank you .

the answer is no . i did n't kill him .

i like that . `` suspension of disbelief . ''

you workin ' on another book ?

read me my rights and arrest me and i 'll go downtown .

listen , lady , we can do this downtown if you --

the usual -- a girlfriend .

what kind of talk ?

do you remember his name ?

he was i.a . he probably asked her about it .

how did she know nilsen knew about it -- if it happened ?

if she 's telling you the truth .

catherine told me what was in it .

why not ?

she 's right . you got an icepick in you yet ?

you do n't like punk rockers ?

what is it you got between you ?

hell yes ! could n't get it outta my head for years . still ca n't . nice little kids -- nice husband , was n't porkin ' around -- no financial problems . one day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em . all of 'em . used a knife . he got for a wedding present . did n't even deny it . sweet as honey . said she did n't know why she done it .

it 's my first drink in three months . that okay with you , pop ? she does n't know me . i never saw her before gus and i talked to her .

hallelujah .

she misses me .

she 's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds .

no .

how you 're saying she killed her parents ? did she kill bobby vasquez , too ?

you sure ?

i love it . she 's got a hundred million bucks . she fucks fighters and rock and roll stars . and she 's got a degree in screwing with peoples ' heads .

i said keep it .

she 's got enough money to burn this whole department down .

can there be some mistake ?

how old was she when this happened ?

no . it 's one of the few times i feel good . i used to have to go to work and cook every day . that i got sick of .

do you ever get sick of it ?

why , so you could humiliate me ?

what do you think ?

hey it 's the big a.m..

chateau latour '64 , please .

i guess it was a long time ago .

we got beat .

thanks . your dad called again something about a job .

oh yeah..

you do n't have to be sorry . there 's no one to blame . jean , you 're a real artist . i thought i was one . you made me realize i was n't .

is that the best quality you have ?

you only want one big mac ?

see you later .

i 'd like to squeeze your titties .

fame . my liquid hijack marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it .

life does n't ... make ... sense . this city 's k-killing me . i want my liquid hijack marlboros !

i did n't know .

i need this ?

uh-oh !

i think i 'll take the stairs .

wow , a real response and you 're not even trying to get into my tights . but explain me ... if you 're so down on `` them '' out there , why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em ?

as i was saying : i 'm a woman , and ca n't be taken for granted . are you listening , you batman you ?

`` shreck 's . '' you --

it 's the so-called `` normal '' guys who always let you down . sickos never scare me . at least they 're commited .

if i said yes , then you might think me a norman bates , or a ted bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you .

did n't i say that ?

you mean mistook < u > me < /u > ?

yawn .

it does to me .

damn those carny bolsheviks the other night , throwing bricks at my windows --

your blood , max .

i want in . the thought of busting batman makes me feel all ... dirty . maybe i 'll give myself a bath right here ...

he napalmed my arm . he knocked me off a building just when i was starting to feel good about myself . i want to play an integral part in his degradation .

you buy this `` blurry '' business ?

precisely . but they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that i 've provided . that shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state .

i could teach her my `` french flipper '' trick ...

max , elections happen in november . is this not late december , or have i inhaled too much swamp gas in my time ?

what about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in gotham ?

no , just give you a splitting headache .

quiet , max . what do you think , this is a conversation ?

actually this is all just a bad dream . you 're home in bed . heavily sedated , resting comfortably , and dying from the carcinogens you 've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering . tragic irony or poetic justice ? you tell me .

why , how industrious . and how did you open protected files , may i ask ?

in spirit only , i 'm afraid .

find my brother wilfred . give him this . i have duties he must fulfill in my stead . only family can be trusted .

passion . of course . find the photo of ivy after the flower ball .

advanced botany . dna splicing . recombinant animal plant patterns . pheromone extractions .

specify , please .

i am as well as can be expected .

thanks .

there 's a lovely inn just down --

do n't tell me you 're on his side . again .

alfred has supported me my whole life . now i 'm going to pay him back . i 'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude .

of course , dick grayson , ward of the fabulously wealthy bruce wayne . why would you need a few hundred dollars ?

i could have made it , you know . i did n't need your help .

i 'm afraid to ask .

batgirl , baatgirl , baatgirl .

youwsa ! nothing but air .

i did n't kill your wife .

if we could relay the sunlight-

kill her later . we 've got work to do .

can he save her ?

bad , yes . guy , no . this is one majorly beautiful evil person .

what can i do for you , doctor ? a research grant ? a hospital wing ?

they 're overly protective . you 're not going to hurt me are you , ms ...

dr. isley . it was like i could feel you in the room . you 're ... enchanting . gorgeous . the most beautiful woman i 've ever seen . if you're..um ... free ... this evening .

can i get some help over here ?

umm . what i mean is ... no plans at the moment ...

she 's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-

her name is pamela isley . i saw her talking to gordon . she must have stolen his keys , altered the signal-

anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who joanna clark is ?

then you never loved me ?

i 've got to stop him .

give it up . if you threw yourself-

join you ? i 've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination . when i get through you wo n't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry , do you hear me , you psycho ?

you must show me your secrets , blossom , before i show you mine .

tonight 's a good night .

all the answers are numbers .

master , bruce ?

no demons , son . your monsters are here . until you fact that , i fear you will spend your life fleeing them .

dr. meridian ...

maybe they 're right .

i shall be near at hand . should you need me . and sir , i know it 's difficult but try and have a good time .

do you remember the night i fell into that cave and the bat chased me ?

it 'll never work .

how 's the sonar coming , alfred ?

big house . how many rooms ?

slanta .

no grape could be more intoxicating than you , my dear . but we make due . to your charms . skol .

gracious even in defeat . how vaguely disappointing . when all this could have been ours together .

the press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold , outclassed , and generally outdone in every way ... and what light through yonder window breaks ? ` tis the east . and you are ...

mr ... ?

what are you talking about ?

the last entry read , bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight . bruce insists . i made them go out . i made them take me to the movie . to that theater ... it was my fault . i killed them .

i do n't want to remember !

your memories are repressed . they 're trying to break through . relax . try to remember- .

there 's something i want to talk with you about . it 's ... well , we.. i ...

if i did n't know better , i 'd say you were sulking .

in a sense we are all two people . the side we show in daylight . and that side we keep in shadow .

i 'm not-

what ?

why do you do that ?

a lot of what happened is jagged . pieces missing . i ca n't really remember . i just get flashes . usually in my dreams . i 'd kind of gotten used to them . at least accepted them ... .

you could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang- . i think he felt it too .

excuse me .

wacko ? that a technical term ?

somebody 's been sending me love letters . commissioner gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion .

how can i help you , mr. wayne ?

chase is coming for dinner . why do n't you join us .

exactly . and once you 'd killed him you 'd be lost . like me . all this has to be a choice . otherwise ... it 's a curse .

... i missed two-face by a heartbeat . when we catch him , you got ta let me kill him !

it 's dr. meridian . chase . do you remember me ?

hell . might even bring old stickley here a few extra bucks . huh , fred ?

paranoid ? the psychotic ?

wait ! you said you 'd let me go !

... or death .

i got family . ... please .

oh yes , and certainly _we_ will !

we want to dust him . we truly want to dust him bad .

no . wait ...

holy shit .

you know , if you cut your bathroom in half , you 'd have my apartment .

upstairs . he 's quite docile .

you know , we should 've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart . i bet we would have got on famously .

they do n't come down here . they 're afraid of the lights .

... a hundred and eight ?

do you want a drink ?

i might consider it if you introduce me to miss vale .

great . give me a grant .

bruce wayne . -- i 've read your work . i quite like it .

how can you do that if she 's already off the line ?

`` it worked for van gogh . let 's kiss and make up . ''

i said i 'd call you the minute i got free . and i did -- and here we are .

... we could try that .

i 'll take you home if you 'd like .

goddammit , i expect to be treated like and artist . get off my screen ! !

joker here . can we talk ?

... thank you .

great . how ? ?

yep . he watched the whole thing happen - - recognize the beat cop ? jim gordon

peanuts ?

oh . sorry . i was thinking .

all aver the world . they say he 's spent half of his life overseas .

i 'm afraid you do n't know the half of it . sit down . i have a tale to tell . and not a happy one .

tom jones ?

there are n't hotels ?

he does n't like to say much does he ?

no , annie , no . this is doctor bean . he 's going to be working with us .

oh yes .

yes , although , i really ... .. thank you . yes , it 's great to have him with us . the whole family 's very excited .

not in one piece anyway . i see mrs whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother . i 'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her . the vice president here will vouch for that .

but is she gon na be okay ?

no , seriously - i know he 's your boyfriend , but there 's something about his upper lip that is so weird . what do you think it is , dad ? jen says it 's a moustache , i say it 's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes , resting .

hello there . are you two heading for las vegas ?

say chief , is n't that guy whose camper , ... i mean , off in whose ...

of course i did .

she 's got < u > photos < /u > , barbara .

lydia 's trying , but they do n't believe her .

you know you 're really a pretty girl .

my god , we 're back where we started .

but she < u > saw < /u > us . i could feel it .

oh , honey , we may need that .

is this a punishment for something we did in life ? what can we do ?

they make gypsies look good .

adam , we < u > are < /u > in hell . i hate these people .

just says 'wo n't . ' wait a minute . here it says 'the living are arrogant ... they think they 'll never die , so they refuse to see the dead . '

de < u > ceased < /u > . i do n't know where it came from .

two hours .

i 'll tell you what , barbara . i do n't think we survived that crash .

do n't forget the balls , ernie .

yeah , i want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then i 'll help you .

she 's ready .

so can i ?

stepmother . i 'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles .

you do n't have an appointment , do you ?

< u > do n't say his name < /u > ! just practice . do it < u > yourself < /u > !

we have to start simpler , is that it ?

i 'd nearly given up on you . i was about to leave . i do have other clients .

i do n't wear that stuff to < u > bed < /u > . besides , there 's < u > nothing < /u > wrong with it . i 'm getting out of here .

you 've got to help them .

god , you 're anatomically correct !

beetle !

three syllables .

otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration .

otho 'll know what to do .

there 's only one chinese restaurant in town , darling , the owners are irish and irish people happen to cook cantonese . they do n't know better .

the attic room is locked --

well this is ... i mean , this is the weirdest --

stepmother .

stepmother . she 's out torturing the movers .

i do n't care from guilt . i just want to < u > see < /u > them .

just a minute , maxie . somebody ...

not < u > a building < /u > ! that 's the beauty of it . i think i can buy the < u > whole town < /u > . these people do n't know the value of their property !

it does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in < u > sheets < /u > !

< u > no < /u > ! do not encourage this little ... person .

' i ' will tell you what is boring . once you cover up the wallpaper , knock down a few walls , alter the traffic patterns , and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place < u > might < /u > just be livable . what 's on the third floor ?

< u > i know < /u > ... i read your book , < u > the < /u > < u > haunted tapestries of the waldorf < /u > .

i 'm < u > so < /u > glad you could leave the city to consult me , otho .

perhaps if i were properly motivated .

why not ?

eve is going to stay . the house will not be closed .

why , that 's terrific , chauncey .

yes , robert . i know about the president .

shame on you , chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that . please , sit in the chair .

no .

good , keep your weight off that leg , mr. gardiner . in fact , it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two , if that would be would be possible . since benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs . i can promise you the finest in care , unless , of course , you would prefer to go elsewhere .

yes .

yes . are you planning on making any sort of claim against the rand 's ?

i know , robert ... but , strangely enough , i do n't feel too bad about now ... i feel all right ... i guess it 's easier ... knowing chauncey is here ... to take care of things ...

we have common foes , chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician !

i do n't think so , he should be along soon ...

he 's resting comfortably now . there 's no cause for alarm , yet ...

... eve - this has been an exhausting day for ben ...

i do n't think that 's entirely true , grover .

a black man gave me the message .

i just do n't excite you at all ... i do n't know what you want ... i do n't know what you like ...

he was very ill , i stayed with him for a while .

yes .

i know you do - you and your television ... ... good luck , chauncey .

hello , eve .

that 's good .

yes ... i know , chauncey .

chauncey , i wanted to tell you how dreadful i feel about the accident today , but that i 'm delighted that you are staying with us .

... would you like us to notify anyone for you ?

i can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events .

oh ? certainly ...

your family doctor ?

hello , mr. gardiner . this is sid courtney , washington post .

i 'm glad you like it , mr. gardiner .

mr. gardiner , i 'm morton hull , the producer of 'this evening . '

do you need a doctor ? i could call robert ...

we must speak again , mr. gardiner , many times !

and yours , sir - chauncey gardiner ! how poetic ! chauncey , a name of uncertain meaning ! and gardiner , a bit of the french , a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers ! a beautiful name , my friend !

do you think so ? do you think so ?

... i 've worked very hard and enjoyed my life ... i 've known success ... and i 've felt love ... my associates , chauncey - i 've talked with them about you ... they 're eager to meet you ... very eager to meet you ... i 'm very fond of you , chauncey ... and i understand eve ... tell her that ... tell her i 'm madly in love with her ...

... i 'm about to surrender the horn of plenty for the horn of gabriel , my boy ...

certainly , ben .

... maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position , chauncey ... maybe one day ...

i understand .

you 're looking much better today , ben .

no , ben .

a gardener ! well put , chauncey excellent ! is n't that what a businessman is ? a gardener ? a person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands , who waters it with the sweat from his own brow , and who creates a place of value for his family and community ? yes , chauncey , what a brilliant metaphor -- yes , indeed , a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard .

yes . i like that very much .

welcome to rand memorial hospital , mr. gardiner .

oh , you can tell her later . she 'll never miss you in this crowd .

watch ? you mean just watch me ? doing it alone ?

of course not ! no one has the time to read ! one glances at things , watches television ...

mr. gardiner , i 'm ronald stiegler , of harvard books .

may i help you , mr. gardiner ?

no .

... oh .

mr. chance , i 'm very pleased to meet you .

... my suitcase .

yes sir , i guess that 's true smallest room in the house .

you 're gon na need somebody , someone 's got ta be around for you , boy ... ... you oughta find yourself a lady , chance ... but i guess it oughta be an old lady , 'cause you ai n't gon na do a young one any good , not with that little thing of yours ... ... you 're always gon na be a little boy , ai n't you ? ... goodbye , chance ...

yes . i 've seen that done .

yes , i know the garden very well . i have worked in it all my life . it is a good garden and a healthy one ; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers , as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons . the garden needs a lot of care . i do agree with the president ; everything in it will grow strong , and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds .

yes . that is surprising .

move out ? i do n't understand , thomas .

i would like to stay and work in my garden .

no , thomas . i have never been in an automobile .

... do you drive this , mr. chance ?

joe saracini . he was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house . that was in 1952 .

ever since i can remember , since i was a child .

... how long have you been living here ?

you live here ? ... we do n't have any record of that .

yes . louise will bring me lunch .

... oh , really ...

you look much taller on television , mr. president .

sid , it 's useless !

... thank you , chauncey ... thank you very much . ... all right , robert , i 'm all yours .

you heard ?

no , it 's been a good day - better than yours , from what i 've been told .

tired ... and i 'm getting tired of being so tired . other than that , i 'm doing very well .

oh , ben - i miss you so when i 'm out ... how are you feeling ?

come on , eve . let 's let the men talk , there are so many people that have been asking about you .

hello , sophie .

... maybe you should talk to somebody , darling .

i really do n't know , tom - he seems so honest and simple ... in a way , he 's quite charming ...

i said good night !

no ! he 's a real gardener !

but ... where was this man gardiner before last week ?

so ... ? where the hell is it ?

this information goes back three days . i want the standard file , you know that .

you have proven that already , comrade skrapinov , you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship .

nonsense , mr. president - i thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man .

i just wondered if you had gone over my speech , ben .

mr. president , i 'd like you to meet my dear friend , mr. chauncey gardiner .

i 'm being controlled by the world 's greatest puppeteer , craig schwartz ...

hello , i 'm here about the ad .

people make mistakes .

you 'll have me , after all i 've done to you ?

ah , but you 're forgetting one thing , lambchop .

yeah , well welcome to the nineties .

you 've always loved the animals .

you 're right . you know i was thinking that we should have maxine over for dinner . since you two are partners and all . it might be a nice gesture .

i 've been going over and over my experience last night . it was amazing . i 've decided i 'm a transsexual . is n't that the craziest thing ?

tomorrow . we 're late for lester .

i have to go back now .

the iguana .

i was worried .

we have to make it an early night .

we 've been over this . nobody 's looking for a puppeteer in today 's wintry economic climate .

really ? for most people it 's a rather pleasant experience . what exactly did you ...

you suggest what ? i have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants , my good man . besides , dr. lester will see you now . i think that 's what he said .

my name is schwartz .

no , uh , my name is craig schwartz . i have an interview with mr. lester .

dr. lester , i do n't know what you 're talking about .

uh , import-export . olive oil . right on 7 1/2 actually . in the vacant office . so we 'll still be seeing each other .

no sir , not at all . it 's just that i 'm going to open my own business and ...

ah . yes , the little door . there is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes . if you hurry , you 'll just make it .

i was n't toying with her , sir . i was just ... how old are you ?

thank you for being kind enough to lie . you see , i 've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech . you 're hired . any questions ?

flattery will get you everywhere , my boy . but i 'm afraid i have to trust floris on this one . you see , she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from case western . perhaps you 've read her memoirs , `` i ca n't understand a word any of you are saying . ''

no , it 's okay , sir . just a mixup with your secretary .

lotte ? is that you ?

i 've fallen in love .

so unbolt the fucking door , einstein .

craig , i just do n't find you attractive . and , lotte , i 'm smitten with you , but only when you 're in malkovich . when i looked into his eyes last night , i could feel you peering out . behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness , i sensed your feminine longing peering out , and it just slew me .

sounds good . oblique but intriguing . phone it in .

okay . here it is . ever want to be someone else ? now you can . no kidding . only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes . visit j.m . inc. , mertin-flemmer building . etc. , etc .

sure . it 'd be fun .

lots of things . he 's very well respected . that jewel thief movie , for example . the point is that this is a very odd thing , supernatural , for lack of a better word . it raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self , about the existence of the soul . am i me ? is malkovich malkovich ? was the buddha right , is duality an illusion ? do you see what a can of worms this portal is ? i do n't think i can go on living my life as i have lived it . there 's only one thing to do . let 's get married right away .

im not a homosexual . i just like women for more than their bodies . i guess you could say i 'm the new american male .

buy you a drink , maxine ?

just .

i am dubious , but i do n't welsh . meet me at the stuck pig . seven o'clock . you 're late , i walk . so help me , if i find out you cheated .

you know , if you ever got me , you would n't have a clue what to do with me . that 's the thing , romeo .

no , really .

and fifty other lines to get into a girl 's pants .

emily dickinson .

yes . i 'm the only one . i have to enter malkovich and destroy him from the inside . if not me , who ?

you 've got to tell craig what 's going on . he must never leave malkovich .

i missed you . i 'm sorry . tell me the plan .

maxine says she 'll leave him if he leaves malkovich , plus he 's been challenged to a puppet-duel by mantini .

do you dream often ?

i got ta know the truth , kevin .

count me in .

i understand , but we must protect the vessel at all costs . please , craig , please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours .

no .

my child , i do n't think its a great mystery what craig 's up to .

sweetie ! oh , but we ca n't . it 's business hours . i need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers .

maxine ...

i have to see you . can you call him and invite us over ?

is there dancing ?

what 's the play ?

we 'll see , schwartz . we 'll see .

bad dream , darling ?

sleepy suddenly .

oh , craiggy , that 's brilliant !

wait a minute ! what if everybody knew ? what if we presented malkovich as the world 's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him ? we 'd wipe the floor with the great mantini !

stay in him forever ?

yeah . i 've figured out how to hold on as long as i want . oddly enough , it 's all in the wrists .

yes . how did you know it was me ?

what the fuck is going on ?

oh , my sweet , beautiful lotte .

oh sure . it 's very rewarding ...

aye . speak then if ye must .

was a time i knew what was .

well what ?

i will protect you .

we do n't have nothing sweet no more , baby .

you do n't sit with me ! !

you never forgot me ?

bet you do . everybody miss her . that was a good woman ... well , i do n't know whether the bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help .

i heard your mother took sick , that so ?

miss bodwin . they brother and sister , darlin .

may i come in ?

work ? start learnin your letters again ?

but mama..

mama !

morning .

do you forgive me ?

ooh , yeah ... do n't know if it 's the floor or the skating .

that 's so .

but you did n't come here talking 'bout paul . you came asking about a new girl .

anything white floating around in the woods - if it do n't got a shotgun , it 's something the lord tells me i do n't want no part of .

why ? why he have to ask ? ca n't nobody offer ? what 's going on ? since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog ? !

you sure ?

you planning to do anything about it ?

you shaved .

no sir , i do n't , but i know plank road . 'bout a mile up thataway .

you do n't know her ? judy ? works in the slaughterhouse .

dude , i finally got the venue i wanted . i 'm performing my dance quintet -- you know , my cycle -- at crane jackson 's fountain street theatre on tuesday night , and i 'd love it if you came and gave me notes .

but i guess she told dieter .

visiting friends of hers in palm springs . just picked up and left , never bothered to tell us .

no , man , nothing is fucked here --

her life is in your hands , dude . and report back to us as soon as it 's done .

shit .

so he thinks it 's the carpet-pissers , huh ?

i know my rights .

well maybe you and me could pool our resources -- trade information -- professional courtesy -- compeers , you know --

yeah .

are they gon na hurt us , walter ?

shut the fuck up , donny . this kid is in the ninth grade , dude , and his father is -- are you ready for this ? -- arthur digby sellers .

what do you need that for , dude ?

i 'm shomer shabbas .

so you have no frame of reference , donny . you 're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know --

-- and bowling . i 'll tell you the truth , brandt , i do n't remember most of it. -- jeez ! fuck me !

these are mr. lebowski 's children , so to speak --

wonderful woman . we were very --

and this is the study . you can see the various commendations , honorary degrees , et cetera .

... also , my rug was stolen .

papers . just papers . you know , my papers . business papers .

oh , hey man , how are ya ? i wondered if i 'd see you again .

which one was logjammin ' ?

what 's your drink , dude ?

francis donnelly . pleased to meet you .

well ... no , of course not --

well yes , what did you think this was all about ? fun and games ?

huh . jeez . well , so , did he -- is that yoga ?

finder 's fee ?

please jeffrey . i do n't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects .

so dieter has the money ?

dieter has been on the fringes of -- well , of everything in l.a. , for about twenty years . look at my lp 's . under 'autobahn . '

beaver ? you mean vagina ? -- i mean , you know him ?

her `` co-star '' in the beaver picture ?

no it 's fine , really , uh --

please see him , jeffrey . he 's a good man , and thorough .

if you successfully do so , i will compensate you to the tune of 1 % of the recovered sum .

listen , maude , i 'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho , but i do n't see what it has to do with -- do you have any kalhua ?

is that what that 's a picture of ?

dude , i 'm sorry --

well can we --

no dude .

hy god ! they shot him , walter !

and i 'd like my undies back !

fuck you . fuck the three of you .

oh , shit .

i 'm as jewish as fucking tevye

i 'm saying , i see what you 're getting at , dude , he kept the money , but my point is , here we are , it 's shabbas , the sabbath , which i 'm allowed to break only if it 's a matter of life and death --

i 'm saying if he knows i 'm a fuck- up , then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife ? because he fucking does n't want her back , man ! he 's had enough ! he no longer digs her ! it 's all a show ! but then , why did n't he give a shit about his million bucks ? i mean , he knew we did n't hand off his briefcase , but he never asked for it back .

i mean we totally fucked it up , man . we fucked up his pay-off . and got the kidnappers all pissed off , and the big lebowski yelled at me a lot , but he did n't do anything . huh ?

huh ?

walter , if you 're there , pick up the fucking phone . pick it up , walter , this is an emergency . i 'm not --

look , larry . . . have you ever heard of vietnam ?

we know it 's his fucking homework , walter ! where 's the fucking money , you little brat ?

is this yours , larry ? is this your homework , larry ?

fucking arthur digby sellers wrote 156 episodes , dude .

all but one man died ? there at bitter creek ?

who the f -- have you ever heard of a little show called branded , dude ?

near the in-and-out burger --

fuck your sympathy ! i do n't need your sympathy , man , i need my fucking johnson !

now dude --

now that is ridiculous , dude . no one is going to cut your dick off .

forget about the fucking toe !

whose toe was it , walter ?

well , certainly that 's a possibility , dude --

hmm . well , we were in a handicapped spot . it , uh , it was probably towed .

for christ 's sake , dude .

yeah , and in the meantime what do i tell lebowski ?

thaaat 's right , dude . the beauty of this is its simplicity . if the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong . if there 's one thing i learned in nam --

terrific , walter . but you have n't told me how we get her back . where is she ?

yeah . so as long as we get her back , nobody 's in a position to complain . and we keep the baksheesh .

what the fuck is going on there ?

thaaaat 's right , dude . the weight . the ringer ca n't look empty .

walter , face it , there is n't any connection . it 's your roll .

i do n't see any connection to vietnam , walter .

... they gave dude a beeper , so whenever these guys call --

twenty grand . and of course i still keep the rug .

anyway . how much they offer you ?

when he moved down to venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he 's a pederast .

huh ?

mark it zero !

huh ? oh -- cynthia 's pomeranian . ca n't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture .

yeah , but --

no , but --

huh ? no ! what the fuck are you talking -- i 'm not -- we 're talking about unchecked aggression here --

dude here .

shit !

dude , this is smokey . look , i do n't wan na be a hard-on about this , and i know it was n't your fault , but i just thought it was fair to tell you that gene and i will be submitting this to the league and asking them to set aside the round . or maybe forfeit it to us --

c'mon man , who 're you gon na believe ? those guys are -- we dropped off the damn money --

they did not receive the money , you nitwit ! they did not receive the goddamn money . her life was in your hands !

huh ?

you do n't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday .

look , let me explain something . i 'm not mr. lebowski ; you 're mr. lebowski . i 'm the dude . so that 's what you call me . that , or duder . his dudeness . or el duderino , if , you know , you 're not into the whole brevity thing --

you mean , did you personally come and pee on my --

well sir , it 's this rug i have , really tied the room together-

shit , sorry man .

this is a league game , smokey !

you happy , you crazy fuck ?

i 'm not --

excuse me ! mark it zero . next frame .

what do you want me to do ?

if that 's true , then why 'd you save me ?

thank you .

save it . i do n't want to hear your words . let 's do this now ! ! !

he escaped . you did n't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic .

nothing .

where the hell have you been ?

pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy .

took you long enough .

not alone .

keep your friends close and your enemies closer . is n't that how the saying goes ?

you got something in mind , blade ?

any game worthy of being played is . one must be patient . in this way , i have outlived my enemies . all of them .

not that i 'm in contact with .

blade does n't talk about anything much . what about you , though ?

you 're wasting your time , already been tried .

scud .

do n't try to talk --

going somewhere ?

you do n't have a few minutes , frost .

pass .

you 're wrong .

yes . the vampire apocalypse . it is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the thirst .

who is lamagra ?

i know . take some of my blood .

what are you talking about ?

how long have we been driving ?

i 've been better --

any progress ?

serum -- it 's a human hemoglobin substitute .

preventive medicine .

-- he 's a vampire .

i 'm sorry , i --

you 're a week early .

please --

it 's not a joke . i 've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look , just come up and see him , okay ? five minutes , that 's all i ask .

i do n't know -- look at this blood smear --

blade . once again , our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade . he must be destroyed .

a few thousand scattered about the globe . in the past , we 've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery . that wo n't be necessary after tonight .

then vampirism is a genetic defect , just like hemolytic anemia ?

i did n't . he was cruel enough to let me live . even gave me a souvenir to remember him by .

go on , i 'll be fine !

you 've been listening in the whole time ?

so that 's it ? you guys just patch me up and send me on my way ?

-- jamie kurth , jonathan edmunds --

do n't know -- just that she was afraid --

'give you a hand . i think my sleep for the night just ended .

sometimes . where are we going ?

yes .

domini ?

-- i 'm not staying here !

there 's some stuff that 's hard to part with . editing 's stuff 's up there --

what 's she look like ?

i see for proof positive you 're the goddamn witch --

why ?

-- no , what 's wrong with you ?

was that you laughing ?

-- scared the living shit out of us .

-- chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents . it 's called vandalism .

no , the kids were actors , the townspeople were real . her , the sheriff , the convenience store guy --

not until i get that beta cam back ! we 're both in a world of shit here ! !

so lem me see it .

my ass -- you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there !

< u > one < /u > set . everything from midnight on --

-- last thing i remember were those four clowns shooting the movie --

-- one of us , all of us -- i have no idea -- brought whatever this thing is back here . we 're not going to go out there and spread it around like typhoid mary . we 're gon na figure it out , we 're gon na bring a goddamn < u > end < /u > to it .

-- before you lose your emotional lunch .

i 'd strongly advise you to join us --

yeah . me too .

-- i saw what i saw .

-- things got a way of finding < u > you < /u > here .

heather , does that look like domini there ?

fucking owl !

cotter ?

su casa y shit-o hole-o .

mi casa y su casa !

what 're you , crazy ? ?

what movies ?

never would 've guessed .

you 're a complete fucking idiot , are n't you ?

just let it go , i 've got you !

just hold on !

it 's domini , it 's not domini , i do n't care -- all i know is < u > i 'm < /u > not dealing with something -- < u > anything < /u > -- snuffing me in my sleep . i want to do what we did in the woods -- surveillance of this whole place 24/7 , with somebody monitoring those cameras every second . there 's something , somebody here , i want to see 'em coming .

-- whatever you want , no problem --

all i need --

they were making a movie -- if they were going to steal anything it 'd be < u > just < /u > the tapes , to see if we had anything they did n't .

-- i dunno , i just woke up --

-- and none of 'em were mine ! i-am-so-fucked , i-am-so-fucked -- where the hell was everybody ? ? ?

look over there .

we 're not making blair witch ii here .

-- turn the goddamn camera off !

this is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend , nick leavitt --

what ?

why she kills children .

not planning on sleeping at all .

-- sacred and occult scotch tape .

i thought the movie was bitchin ' .

what ?

what is it you thought you saw on that tape ?

two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back .

motion . stop there . play it again .

hmm ? i dunno . chafing from the backpack , something .

like a blueprint for disembowelment .

you < u > know < /u > what we picked up in the woods --

put 'em together that 's a `` k. '' james kurth --

i ca n't do it !

we are being fucked with here , someone or something .

hey , chemicals , fear , sleep- deprivation -- and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult -- hell 've a recipe for a mind-fuck .

jesus , you do n't think i know that ? you do n't think i 've tried ? she wo n't fucking < u > go < /u > -- she wo n't leave this place .

finally got her back to sleep .

-- bullshit --

-- his name 's von teer ! his daughter 's named domini ! --

well , i do n't know ... call it a fringe benefit .

meurice ...

jack daniels . do n't worry , i 'm paying for it .

i think it 's important not to get depressed . depression is a terrible thing . they say it can bring on illness .

shit . let 's drink to something else . let 's drink to fuckin ' . say here 's to your fuck frank .

you did ? a human ear ?

he 's alright , i guess . i hope . they 're doing tests , that 's why i 'm home from school . i was over at the hospital this morning and i was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood . there behind vista , i found an ear .

then , shut up !

you want to see him too , right ?

hello , daddy .

alright , suit yourself .

where have you been ? oh god . they hurt him , jeffrey . jeffrey , jeffrey , jeffrey , hold me . hold me . oh god .

i want you to stay with me .

men are crazy . then they put their craziness into me . then it makes me crazy . then they are n't so crazy for awhile . then they put their craziness in me again . . it 's burning me . but i love you . i do , i do . did you know that ? did you know that i love you ?

i asked first .

shut up .

that 's good .

who are you ? maybe i 'll need to . you like me , huh ?

don ? . are you in with them ?

no . please , dorothy . why are you in so much trouble ?

. same here .

no .

yes .

no . come on .

we 're going to leave that up to detective williams . i 'll tell you though . you 're okay . you shot a real son of a bitch .

you seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with dorothy vallens .

no , i want ya to fuck it . shit , yes . pour the fuckin ' beer .

i should go with her , sandy .

no . is detective gordon going to be at your house ?

my father has a gun at home .

frank ! !

you want to dance ?

... you look beautiful .

it 's good to see you .

yeah . i think so . i just had to tell him some of what i knew . is friday still on ?

you like mysteries that much ?

i will . i 'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five , okay ?

yeah . but .

i 'd like an ice-cold heineken .

first of all , we 're going to the slow club to see dorothy vallens . we 'll watch her for awhile . i 'd like to hear her sing anyway , and then also we 'll know she is there and not in her apartment .

great . i 'll pick you up around eight o'clock . is that good ?

i do n't want you to get involved , really , i mean , i do , but if something went wrong i mean , like you said , they may be involved in murder .

i owe you . since i goofed up this one .

i did n't get a good look at him either , but he sure looked at me . i did n't have time to get a window , but i found this key . pretty nifty , huh ?

now , how are you going to do that ?

alright . the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that i could crawl into later .

what happened to him ?

yeah . it 's close by . that 's what 's creepy . they 've had her under surveillance for a couple of months , except i do n't know what they 've found out because my father is n't in charge of her .

maybe so .

yes .

it 's good to see you , dad .

nothing . i 'm fine .

of course , jeffrey .

alright .

yeah ?

well . okay .

i mean , for good , jeffrey .

later mike . i got ta take care of someone who 's hurt here , in case you have n't noticed .

please excuse me a moment , jeffrey , and i 'll get to the dishes .

say `` goodnight '' to sandy .

i just wanted to ask him a few questions , that 's all . maybe i better go .

i do n't know why we have to watch t.v .

quiet ! callate ! where 's diego ?

motherfucker works fast .

norman cay is not a person . he is an island , george . in the bahamas . from what they say , it is free and it 's diego 's new home .

you wan na split ?

yeah . i am .

this is it for me .

derek !

you 'll see for yourself .

you ca n't sell this to your friends .

no , i cam here out of my own volition .

what details ? i put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs .

you ?

i heard .

look , i 'm sorry about everything . i feel like an idiot . you were right . i did fuck you . and then diego fucked me . cut me out , too .

i do n't think so .

yeah , i know , it 's a lot of weight .

we want some grass .

i did not .

no more brothers , diego .

george , i am happy to see you . how are you , my brother ?

this is not the time , diego .

then relax . it 's a federal bank . guaranteed by the government . and senor noriega has very lenient banking principles . no questions . no problems . all the pesados keep their money here . even el padrino . what do you worry ? everyone knows we are with escobar . who is going to fuck with us ?

george , we 've got sixty-one million dollars . it 's either here or someplace else . we 've got to put it somewhere . unless you want to launder it .

we 're half a million off .

thirty-six hours . i ca n't believe it . everything is gone in thirty-six hours .

and what happens when these guys stop paying ? sooner or later , these guys are going to cut us out . then where are we ?

good to see you , diego .

do we need a plane ? how does this work ? when do i see you ?

allo ?

murder .

intriguing . i see . would you like to know my crime ?

oh , i see .

mirtha comes from a very wealthy family .

oh , shut up , fred . shut your big fat mouth . you do n't buy it all at once . it 's called layaway .

yeah . nice .

i just ca n't get over the size of that ring . i just love it . fred , look at it . tell me you do n't love that ring .

yeah , well , what are you gon na do ? you and me , pablo ? are we good ?

it is very difficult . diego makes me a lot of money . if diego goes so does the money . you were an excellent teacher , george . when the student has learned well , the teacher is no longer necessary . we must remember we have wives , friends , familia . even familia that has not been born . but sometimes , we must forget as well . i am like you . i must teach the lesson . we want to teach the lesson . but we can not . we must remember that life is the teacher .

and diego ?

the man who gives us the airplanes . the man from america . the mafia . chicago . boom boom . hollywood . you are going to open for us the gates of hollywood , george ?

did you know i died two weeks after you sent me that tape ?

hi .

yeah , dad . i 'm happy right now .

you mad at me ?

you loved her , did n't you ? you really loved her .

alright . you want me to get your old job back ? because i could , you know , i could put in that word .

i know .

what the fuck ? is he going to walk ?

look what the cat dragged in .

figured it out .

you know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money ? being how we do n't want to get jobs and whatnot ? well , check this out .

well , i got a call from pablo . he said this thing with diego is a disaster . he 's giving up lab locations , names , bank accounts , he was very pissed off . pablo said to take him down . his exact words were `` fuck diego . ''

mirtha , what 's going on ? everything okay with kristina ?

yeah ? i better see some money out of it .

yeah . she told me . you walk her to school .

hey , why do n't you just put a `` i 'm doing cocaine '' sign on the car . what is your fucking problem ?

out .

i did n't mean to ...

i swear on your life .

that 's right . three o'clock . thursday . at your mother 's . you and me . it 's a date .

what is it ? a disneyland thing ?

kristina , c'mon , i 'm sorry . i 'm going to make this right . i 've got a few things going on ...

jesus , george , fifteen percent . that 's an extra two-hundred large .

sounds fine . i 'll need to meet everybody .

who 's the co-pilot ?

holy shit , dulli !

no , man . i 'm too fucked up .

you know , he 's got a point . we 're fucking americans . we stick out like sore thumbs .

cheer up , man . half this money is ours . we 're fucking rich .

twenty , forty , sixty , eighty , nine . twenty , forty , sixty , eighty , a thousand . it 's all there . wow . a hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars .

second district ...

i think it 'll be a success ...

where were we ?

under the law a person can not profit from their own wrong doing . since rebecca lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will , if she is found guilty the will is void and joanne braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated .

i 'm sorry to barge in -- but i figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news ?

you 've got to get me something i can use , charlie .

how you doin ' mister d ?

so she knew about his heart ?

thank you , doctor mccurdy . your witness .

we found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood .

the official cause ?

he was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago .

you 've been following me ?

your honor , i fail to see what mrs crawford 's educational background has to do with this case .

suspicions maybe -- but suspicions are n't enough for a conviction .

why would she want that ?

you 're bluffing . john , it 's me , remember ? i 've known you since your name was juan carlos .

no . i have n't done it in years .

thank you .

show me .

he did everything he could to take care of his heart ?

doctor trammel , when did you first diagnose that mr. marsh had heart disease ?

well -- i think that after the operation she realized that ...

how did your relationship with miss lawson progress after the surgery ?

fine . the doctors say if i keep taking care of myself i can live to be a very old man .

intense .

how would you describe your sex life with miss lawson ?

that 's enough .

i suggest it never happened .

yes .

dr. paley , where were you the last time you saw miss lawson ?

did miss lawson ever accompany mr. marsh inside during his examinations ?

dr. trammel , did you ever speak to miss lawson about mr. marsh 's condition ?

would you describe for the court what chinese peony root looks like ?

because he called me .

a.m -- or p.m. ?

well - i 'm a little confused . this is a charge receipt from rosen 's drug store where mr. marsh had an account . it 's dated the day of the murder . is this your signature ?

you 've tried it ? is n't it true that you 've been in and out of rehab centers for the last four years ?

i 'm a practical woman mr. dulaney . killing andrew was n't in my best interest . as it is i 'm out of a job and i 'm not in his will .

you 're lying . marsh was wearing a cast on the tape . it was right before he went to chicago and met miss lawson . he dumped you for her , did n't he ?

well , think about it . is n't it possible ?

yes -- it was on a friday . i remember because i was going to visit my sister for her birthday . it would be october twenty-eighth .

did mr. marsh use drugs ?

that 's crazy .

i do need you . no matter what you think of me -- i did n't do it .

you were brilliant today .

she 's mistaken .

what ?

no -- that 's what i know you were thinking .

that 's not an answer .

i think we 're getting a little off the subject here .

we 're not animals .

those same men will be sitting on the jury .

you still have n't answered my question .

well , i guess that makes you the best . look , frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars . as executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us . all i 'm asking you to do is talk to her .

well , that 's kind of how i am right now .

objection . the witness has already stated that miss lawson left without an explanation .

but your honor --

it was a place to start .

because i knew you 'd think exactly what you 're thinking .

why did you lie to me ?

charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you . you were with her , were n't you ?

we have to talk .

it had to get there somehow .

i said no !

does n't matter . move on .

so !

i nearly died when we split the bill .

what about me ! i feel really weird . like she cheated on me , not dad . is n't that sick ? i do n't mean i wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son . you 're sort of made to feel like you 're the prince of the kingdom , ya know ? and in the back of your mind , you kind of think your mother does n't need sex anymore because she has you .

what gets me is i 'm 46 years old . i 've been in this crummy fucking marriage -

yeah . but i thought she died .

no . we 're going to lock this up and --

i ca n't believe she 's making jokes .

this happened way before we both got married . i ... i ca n't believe it . you think she had sex with him ?

that he be cremated and his ashes thrown on roseman bridge .

what ?

`` -- going over and over in my mind every detail , every moment of our time together and i ask myself , `` what happened to me in madison county ? '' i struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we 're on separate roads . but then i look through the lens of my camera , and you 're there . i start to write an article and i find myself writing it to you . it 's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other , towards those four days , all our lives --

yeah .

oh , that 'll be nice .

hi . i made some brown betty . i sent floyd off to town with the boy . i said - `` floyd , i 'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that 's all there is to it . he said who 's going to make lunch ? i said i 'm taking a sick day . eat at the dinner . '' is n't that hilarious ? he did n't dare raise an eyebrow -- i do n't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the sandford ranch . i am so sorry , honey , i let two days pass before i came by , but with the boy home the time just escapes me . have you heard from richard ? how 's the fair ? god , it 's hot .

no . do n't do this .

i 'm going to be here a few more days . i 'll be at the inn . we have some time . let 's not say any more now .

i want to keep it forever . i want to love you the way i do now the rest of my life . do n't you understand -- we 'll lose it if we leave . i ca n't make an entire life disappear to start a new one . all i can do is try to hold onto to both . help me . help me not lose loving you .

robert . please . you do n't understand -- no one does . when a woman makes the choice to marry , to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops . you build a life of details . you become a mother , a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move . and when they leave they take your life of details with them . and then you 're expected move again only you do n't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long . not even yourself . you never in your life think that love like this can happen to you .

francesca , listen to me . you think what 's happened to us happens to just anybody ? what we feel for each other ? how much we feel ? we 're not even two separate people anymore . some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people do n't even think it exists and you 're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do ? that staying here alone in a marriage , alone in a town you hate , in a house you do n't feel apart of anymore -- you 're telling me that 's the right thing to do ! ?

fine . more eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time ?

yes . absolutely . you have this habit of not needing and that it 's hard to break . i understand . of course , in that case , why sleep -- you do n't need rest or for that matter eat , you do n't need food .

sleep all right ?

uh-huh . and ?

it 's okay . it 's not that hot anymore . thanks god .

couple . want to help ?

the cashier at the general store was very dangerous .

listen , do n't take this the wrong way but , i 'm wondering if this is such a good idea .

the light was fading . huh-huh .

why does n't it scare you ?

you drink bug repellent ?

oh you !

she starts sniffing me .

that 's very nice of you . i do n't get many dinner invitations on the job . it would be a welcome change . thanks .

yes . very clean .

no , your kids .

i 'm so sorry about that . it was rude . i think i just got nervous for some reason .

mind if i smoke ?

oh , that 's nice .

i found this chicago station before . wait a minute ... here it is .

this wo n't take long . i 'm shooting tomorrow morning . i just need to do some prep work .

small town on the eastern side no one 's ever heard of called bari .

well , from italy to iowa -- that 's a story ! whereabouts in italy ?

pretty country .

i said to him cary you 're being ridiculous . you 're more than half her age . he said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me .

`` i had forgotten this . i had somehow remembered it being more his fault , his decision . then i remembered we made love in that field before we left for home . and i remembered it was my idea . i remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body , hoping he would kidnap me . i had forgotten that too . and i wondered , as i sat there ... how many other things i 'd forgotten . ''

i ca n't sleep .

okay .

you people really do n't like dogs .

hey , kid .

how the hell should i know ?

some flies ? i think this qualifies as way more than `` some . ''

nothing . contact paranoia . must be buggin ' from hanging with you .

you did n't hear that ? `` take him ... `` something . `` bury him '' or ...

or just hell-adjacent ...

is this hell ?

well , go find his lazy ass . i scratch any more tonight i 'm gon na have carpal tunnel syndrome .

just try it .

but things change . you got ta think ahead .

sounds like mama needs a brand new bag .

who ? who is he ? what is he ?

please . it 's for your own good .

maybe once upon a time . but that was long ago . back before ... before it became what it is .

here , find my hand . the stairs are right near here . i saw them . let 's just walk up there .

what ? oh yeah . coming .

the dead get out ?

how do you know ?

let me see it .

dad ?

you could have had it done . you did n't want us there .

listen to me , boy . i did n't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in !

what are we doing down here ?

but maybe we 're the ones who should be down there . doing something . making it better .

nice rack . how old is --

you 're right . one of my associates sold the building last month .

maybe so . maybe so . but that ai n't why i came to see you . you sold the building .

or you did n't know what to do with it .

not your style . is it eddie ? killing off your customers ?

shit , that was fast .

no more thoughts from your asses . or i will burn your asses and snort the ashes . hear me ?

get that car the hell away from here , now ! i spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool . but this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off .

just what army do you think the colonel was in ? everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the klan . `` special recipe '' . i 'm telling you . there 's something in the batter . say it makes a black man sterile .

yeah right , and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all vincent price 's cash .

not really to live , just to play .

it 's not safe down there . the fire started down there . the whole thing could collapse .

you sure we oughta save him ? why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling ?

evidence of what ?

the money i bet it was nothing to get it clean , after you made such a fucking big deal ...

i 'll have whatever violet 's drinking .

glenlivet , right , gino ?

i ca n't . i ca n't .

stay away !

sit down , gino !

you aim a gun at me ? ! do you know who i am ? ! i am gino marzzone . you understand ?

ask johnnie ! ask your rat-fuck son !

but everybody is all right .

i 've seen the way he looks at you . he 's always wanted you . maybe two million dollars finally bought you .

caesar , this is crazy .

you ca n't leave .

violet , please !

it could n't have been .

why ?

no ! they 're still on their way .

it was unbelievable ! un-fucking- believable !

caesar , i 'm serious . this is too much . i have to get out of here .

i 'm going to make myself a drink , if that 's okay ?

how 's it going tonight , fellas ?

now , where the fuck is my money ?

five .

how many 'd you do ?

call me as soon as you get him .

oh christ , the phone ... that was a fucking stupid thing to do , was n't it ?

yeah ?

hello ?

we 're almost there , violet . just hang on .

oh , christ , i got to get out of here !

that means he probably will kill johnnie .

that 's okay , as long as he believes it was johnnie .

if he runs , everyone will assume he took the money .

the same way i 'll know that you went to scotch . trust .

shit ! oh shit !

gino marzzone .

like each other ? they hate each other .

in his office . i saw it this morning .

you said he washed the money ?

all you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected , someone like me .

i did n't say that , but since you did , let 's say that you are . it would have been easy to set shelly up . you could have got him killed knowing that caesar would bring the money to the apartment .

caesar is going to get the money and bring --

yes .

no . shelly knows what i am . he saw me in a bar with another woman .

if there is one thing i ca n't stand about sleeping with women , it 's all the fucking mind reading .

yes there is . i felt it this morning when i brought you the coffee .

nothing .

so am i .

yes , it is .

they took over a club i was working at . caesar started managing it .

you have to ask ?

is n't it obvious ? i 'm trying to seduce you .

a beer ?

what do you want ?

i 'm sorry , i usually would call rajeev , but i did n't know what to do so i called mr. bianchinni .

oh , really .

i guessed you were straight black .

hi . my name is violet . we sort of met in the elevator --

hey , johnnie ...

i told you , the family does n't want the police around . we want to take care of it ourselves and we will . i 'll find him . i swear i will .

our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago . even if they stayed in the car , the grid is huge . this is it . he 's trained -- conditioned -- they 're built to disappear . you give him another day to run and we may never find him .

no . we ca n't risk it .

i thought you were never going to do that .

... what did you do ? ... you must 've really fucked up ...

... which one are you ? ...

they 're right about you , are n't they ? you 're fried . you really do n't know what 's going on , do you ?

did you bring investment advice for me tonight ? it was tax shelters , was n't it ? swiss debenture-swaps .

look , maybe i should just ...

one moment , sir .

-- hang on -- i need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment , s'il vous plait --

there was an accident . on the motorway . apparently , he was killed instantly . really , i 'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this ...

yes .

we also thought we had n't heard from you -- we 've had a bit of a publicity nightmare , people have been talking . our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke .

excuse me ?

think i could rent a scooter ?

xxxxxx

it does n't matter who you were before . it 's who you want to be . that 's all that matters . we have this money . we have what we have . i had nothing before and now , i do n't know , maybe i have more , maybe it 's nothing , but ... i say we leave here . we leave this place . we go until we ca n't go anymore .

it 's a name . mr. wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht . he 's the proud owner of an alliance security package . he also paid a visit to the morgue to see john michael kane .

-- there 's no time --

but the police --

you knew he was coming .

-- we can go -- i can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --

-- quiet -- < u > quiet < /u > --

jason ...

i should go .

i guess .

i kept trying things , i thought if i could find all the things i could do , i could --

just so you know , if you 're gon na burn me on the money , you might as well kill me . i was supposed to have this car back three days ago . it 's not my car .

what if i say no ?

so what 's in paris ?

sam - we 've always been close , have n't we ?

it could all be coincidental .

well , that 's it ! i may as well go and hang myself ! this sort of thing could n't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization ! that was simmons doing ! and he and jeffries always sit together at lunch ! the bastards ! ow ! perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...

hang on .

i 've never seen a ministry cheque before .

would you really , sam ?

i 've told you before . i 'd turn it down .

is n't it ? whose is it ?

gillian layton - suspect s/5173 . truck driver ! all enquiries , reference officer 412/l - room 5001. that 's what i wanted to know . thank you very much .

i 'll tell you what ... . you tell me what and i 'll do it for . i 'm a bit of a whizz on this thing .

i 'm sorry . i don ' t want dessert . i do n't want promotion . i do n't want anything .

this is n't rare !

i hope you like it . it 's very exclusive .

um ...

er ... i assure you mrs buttle , the ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error . if you have any complaints which you 'd like to make , i 'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms .

thirtieth floor , sir . you 're expected .

my name is sam lowry . i have to report to mr warren .

it 's a 27b/6 of course .

we are virgins .

never . no cigarettes , no drugs , no booze .

stressed ? he 's psycho .

mary ...

so , frank , am i going to live ?

ten-four .

i 'm not your baby , young , i 'm not your mother either . you 're going to a cardiac arrest , avenue c and ninth , northeast corner . it 's a club . take the side entrance .

twelve young , i do n't have time for your games . now answer me or do i have to come out there myself ?

shut up . you 're going to die and he 's not . got it .

i need to sit down a minute .

we can still go back . i 'll walk you home . you sleep a couple of hours , watch some tv , take a bath .

if i 'm not back in fifteen minutes , hit the buzzer . that way she 'll let me go .

maybe i should come up with you .

excuse me . you seemed like you were in trouble .

i better go check on my father . thanks for the pizza . i owe you one . maybe when he gets better , you know , when we 're done with all this .

how long you been doing this ?

it 's been bad lately , but it 's always bad .

look , i 'm sorry , but it 's important to me . i mean , a week ago i was wishing he was dead . and now i want hear his voice again , just once more -- you know what i mean ?

i 'd take her , but then who would stay here ?

our lady of misery .

i 'm not so sure . my father and i have n't spoken in three years . when my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack , that he 'd locked himself in the bathroom , all the way going over i was thinking how i was gon na tell him what a bastard he was . then when i got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed , i thought of all these other things i wanted to say .

i 'll drink to that .

i do n't want to hear about it , okay ? that 's three jobs for the night . it 's over . three jobs and time for a drink . six am , the cocktail hour . pass the bottle ; i know you 're holding .

she 's no whore , marcus .

went over to sal 's got this . there must be some place in hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice . i call you if anything comes up .

god help us , he 's hungry too .

she 's the daughter of a cardiac arrest i brought in last night . i told her we 'd give her a ride back to misery . her father 's showing signs of improving .

who 's that ?

he 's not dead . it 's a heroin overdose . break out the narcon .

would you like to come in ?

you have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own .

he coded . they shocked him one too many times . i 'm sorry .

okay , whatta i do ?

c'mon , look at your screen . give up some blood !

well , he 's the steakhead of the night , then .

i never felt better in my life .

i feel the need , the need for speed . i 'm driving out of myself .

the cure 's not working , tom . maybe we should go back to the hospital .

you 're in the stomach ! let me try .

jesus , tom walls , that crazy motherfucker .

i 'm not hungry .

oh no ! -- i just remembered .

no ! it 's three o'clock . that can only mean one thing .

yes . you 're not going to stick around for the farewell party ?

why ? what did they do to you ?

what did they do with you ?

no . that 's not going to tell us anything . let 's get this prompter going .

fifty , right ?

i 'm starting to ... we may do the capitols of the states .

never to pretend to know more than i did .

you have the job you have ...

same old stuff . i 'm watching a man who won three overseas press awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea .

shit , shit , shit ...

office bimbo . no , i 'm sorry .

eventually rising to ...

that 's your full name ?

let 's go ...

yes , yes . i know . right . and if it had gone well for me tonight , maybe i 'd be keeping quiet about all this ... i grant you everything but give me this ... he does personify everything you 've been fighting against ... and i 'm in love with you . how do you like that ? -- i buried the lead .

this is n't friendship .

i know you care about him . i 've never seen you like this about anyone , so please do n't take it wrong when i tell you that i believe that tom , while a very nice guy , is the devil .

aaron , will you tell me ?

thanks , jane . have a good time tonight .

okay , great -- good luck .

yes .

not because you have to .

last time paul was sick they gave connie the weekend news instead of me .

good night .

he must have been great-looking , right ?

yeah --

all this business of war -- do you get scared ?

almost immediately .

yeah , i know , i went back and forth on it .

i 'll speak to you .

hey , buddy , do n't do that anymore .

how horrible . we 'll be fine . you 'll be fine . stay here with me -- we 'll go for a drive , have some drinks , make happy plans .

they fired me .

honey ? ...

oh my . i see you studying so hard , tom . what do you think the problem is ?

it 's not .

tom is n't ready for the job you 're about to hand him . not near ready . not by the longest shot . aaron 's spent six weeks in tripoli , he 's interviewed gaddafi -- he reported on the eight-one story . i think he 's essential to do the job we 're capable of and i think it 's my responsibility to tell you that .

what a great surprise . i did n't think we had a chance . i heard you wanted to stay in washington .

why did i have to do this to myself ? watch you take off . call me if you need anything .

it 's just that one of the few things i 'm not confused about is what i was saying downstairs , that ...

we disagree on how god-awful it was . why do n't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time ?

sorry . i ca n't stand here feeing bad that i do n't feel worse . this has happened at every station i ever worked for . look , i think it 's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job . i have a week to get to my job . let 's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this .

that 's so perfectly ... it really makes me feel a little faint ... whooo .

i know . i taped it .

this is hysterical .

you 're not going to take off on me , are you ?

good . that 's it ... see you .

it moved me . i did relate to it -- i really did . it was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice ... but it 's real and it got me ... and i think a lot of the time i 'm too conservative about that kind of stuff . okay ?

nooo . is it your story ?

what ?

there 's no gang in there -- we were the last ones .

i 'm going over to aaron 's . maybe i 'll hoop up with all of you later . how long do you think you 'll be there ?

okay , billion ... right , of course . they told me i could have any producer i wanted -- and i want you .

can i buy you dinner sometime soon ?

so great -- right ?

yes . my room is down here -- i 'm not tired . do you want to keep talking ?

if we could just eat first .

are you okay ?

um ...

are you nervous , walter ?

uh-huh .

listen schmuck , why do n't you get out of here and let me go to bed !

i wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening .

i 've been thinking ... carla , would you do one favor for me ?

- even though leonard 's always asking you to go out with him and i - just -

i like you very much , walter .

well ... w-what kind of people do you like , carla ?

well ... what did you want to talk to me about ?

well i ca n't say that walter ! she 's incomparable . they 're both great .

you 're right . we should build a collection first .

nothing ... nothing at all .

right . ai n't no body of work complete without some ... nudes -

i wonder what his deal is .

i mean , screw them , you know ? i 'm just gon na go right on creating 'cause it comes from here - you know ?

it 's our road kill series . i take the pictures .

yeah ?

never mind ...

a show ? ! like this sunday ?

well make a dog , make a parakeet ! i 'm sure you 'll think of something .

alright , i 'll tell you what . i 'll put it in the corner of the alcove . if it sells , we 'll split it fifty- fifty . how 's that ?

well ... why did you put a knife in it ?

you want to buy it , put it in the club ?

dead cat !

i did n't buy it i made it .

i was just looking at carla 's picture .

i 'm trying to reach lieutenant beldere ...

i tried to contact you by phone but i could n't ...

wait a minute - i told you i did n't do nothing wrong !

alaska ! what the heck 's wrong with it !

you 're in some deep shit pal , whether you know it or not .

you 're like an undercover guy !

hm .

uh , sure .

i do n't ! but fifty thou ? that 's not money , that 's manna !

maxwell .

`` let them die , and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands , that he might form an ashtray or an ark - ''

well i 'm overjoyed .

i do n't think so mayolia .

with dead cat . like a breath of fresh air . i could just - babble on about it for hours .

what do you get ?

good night , mrs. swicker -

oh no , that 's ok , i can fix myself something . besides , i got something important to do ...

if you were my son ... why do n't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup , it wo n't take but a minute .

cheer up . you may still .

let 's move out !

you think ? split ?

yes .

he does n't look fifty .

oh , my god . is that true ?

uum ... around ten ?

so i noticed .

jealous ?

i think you 've forgotten something .

you 're even weaker than the others .

are you okay ?

will i get the shit kicked out of me if i ask you to dance ?

it 's not a mixer . it 's the senior dance . and it 's important . you would n't understand .

second word ... sound like 'dance ' .

pike , i do n't think you 're up to this .

why 'd you come back ?

you know , you saved my life . and i just wanted to say ... i forgive you for talking during the movie . almost .

hey , jeez are you okay ? you need a hand ?

it could happen .

like what ?

'one that reflects the students ' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them . '

get out of my facial .

listen to you . what language are you speaking ?

oh my god you 're having an affair .

i do n't see why we have to invite everyone .

please . they show previews for foreign movies .

i kind of had to improvise . sorry about your guitar .

buffy , do n't ... do n't start thinking of me as your friend . it interferes with the work , and it ...

it 's what i was raised to do . there are n't many of us left , the watchers .

not if you 're careful .

oh , wonderful . my secret weapon is - pms . that 's just great . thanks for telling me .

toasty . were there ever any , like , famous vampires ?

i do n't think you understand the full implications of --

oh . good .

in a way , yes . your fate is inexorably connected to them .

all right . what do we do now ?

none of your business . god .

i was a slave .

just stay away from me , okay ?

i do n't have time for your prattling . i have proof . you bear the mark .

hey , buffers . you look thrashed .

i guess .

what ... are you ?

yes , i 'm sure they do . this place is everything you said it was , amilyn .

you are much more .

oh , yes ! yes !

okay , what else ?

buffy ?

does jeffrey know ?

you want some punch ?

i 'm , like , yelling at her , 'what are you doing ? ' and she 's going 'jeffrey , jeffrey ! ' way mental .

okay .

i got ta leave first thing in the morning .

i 'd like you to meet my father .

of course i 'm seducing you for godsakes , and i 'm doing a damn poor job of it -- are n't i pretty ?

death is like spring training ?

much better . your delivery was fully integrated because you were n't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me . this is progress .

my right nostril ?

big league pitchers do n't use these .

y'know if you make it to the bigs you could still become the host of dance fever . baseball 's a good stepping stone for things like that .

yeah maybe you 're right .

i got lured .

you 'd be great , just great ... 'cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an ' all -- but the fact is that there 's a spacious- '' non-time kind of time '' to it ...

what happened ?

if you know where home plate is , then you know where 1st base is , and 2nd , and everything else -- 'cause they 're always in the same place in relation to home . do n't you see ? if you know where home plate is , then you know where everything else in the universe is !

what 's so great about baseball ?

crash , i get wet just thinking about you .

i want you desperately !

he ' s confused --

nuke wo n't go to bed with you , eh ?

your place or mine ?

damn .

but you were pulling your hips last night .

wait , crash -- do n't go -- all i want is a date . i 'm not gon na fall in love with you or nothin ' .

i believe in the soul , the cock , the pussy , the small of a woman 's back , the hanging curve ball , high fiber , good scotch , long foreplay , show tunes , and that the novels of thomas pynchon are self-indulgent , overrated crap . i believe that lee harvey oswald acted alone , i believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter , i believe in the `` sweet spot '' , voting every election , soft core pornography , chocolate chip cookies , opening your presents on christmas morning rather than christmas eve , and i believe in long , slow , deep , soft , wet kisses that last for 7 days .

crash , i did n't think you --

three-fourteen ? hmmm ... look't those thighs , jackson

let 's have a quick word of prayer , right here , to thank the lord for all this --

never heard of 'em .

you think dwight gooden leaves his socks on ?

well shit , then , let 's fuck .

no , that is not belief . that is desperation .

yes . a switch hitting witch . very common in puerto rico .

what 's that ?

you 're a cocksucker !

beg me !

try it ! go ahead . call me a cocksucker !

no ! i said it was a cock-sucking call and you ca n't run me for that !

you missed him !

nuke -- good luck .

you will . look , nuke -- these big league hitters are gon na light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile -- do n't worry about it . be cocky and arrogant even when you 're getting beat . that 's the secret . you got ta play this game with fear and arrogance .

why are you a fuck ? 'cause you got talent . i got brains . but you got talent ! you 're god damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year . all my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound -- and that 's for science and dog meat .

why am i a fuck ?

what 's wrong ?

you told him i was throwing a deuce , right ?

god -- what a big league move .

i wo n't have to .

you 're through with one night stands ? ! what do you want ?

how come you do n't like me ?

hey ! what 're you guys doing here -- stealing my girl ?

crash , shut the door .

who you calling a `` boy '' ?

no way .

well tell 'em , honey .

i put in a word for you with the organization -- told 'em i thought you 'd make a fine minor league manager someday ... might be an opening at salem next year --

eight and sixteen ? ! how 'd we ever win eight ? jose , what 's this sign ?

ohyeah . i shoulda throwed a slider . damn , crash , how 're ya ?

he goes to a whorehouse every night ?

they called me up to the show and i wanta tell crash goodbye .

uh , i - i 'd ... i 'd like to answer - answer that at this time .

these guys back home do n't give a fuck about the supreme court and any of this bullshit ! they want things to quiet down . they want you to walk away from -

it 's a tough proposition , andy . you , you know , if i did it , i 'd have to run it my way .

but what happens when they do find out ?

as far as the world was concerned andy stone , the head of the teamsters ' pension fund , was a legitimate guy .

hey !

yeah , i do n't want her in there more than a few more minutes .

watch it , partner , watch it !

sam , i - i do n't know where she is , okay ?

you understand ? put her on the fuckin ' phone .

you do ? yeah ? well , if you ever come back again ... ever ... to take her money ... next time bring a pistol . that way you got a chance . be a man , do n't be a fuckin ' pimp . now , you want to do me a favor ? get out of here . i want to be alone with my wife . get the fuck up and get out of here .

yeah .

i 'll be right there .

... ginger 's missing and she tied amy up and she locked her in her room . i got ta find her . i do n't know where the hell she is .

well , once you get her here , you think about it , you know ? but get the kid back here . she wants to come back . that 's the , uh , that 's the main thing here . you want your kid , do n't you ? huh ?

i do n't know . what am i gon na do with this woman ? i do n't know ... she 's drivin ' me fuckin ' crazy .

the problem was , nicky was not only bringin ' heat on himself , but on me too . the fbi watched every move he made . but he did n't care . he just did n't care .

ju-just stay away from her . it 's none of your business , okay ? there are certain things you do n't do , and you know that .

and i - what was i supposed to do , throw her out ?

yeah .

... uh , uh , cigarette holder . i 'm - i lost control ? !

well , back home they do n't know about fuckin ' control . that looks bad .

fine .

i do n't wan na come along with you .

listen , nick , you got ta understand my situation . i 'm responsible for thousands of people . i got a hundred million a year goin ' through the place . it 's all over , i 'm gon na tell you , it 's all over , if i do n't get that license . and believe me , if it goes bad for me , it 's gon na go bad for a lot of people , you understand ?

you think he got the point ?

well , it was n't long before what i was afraid was gon na happen , happened . nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in las vegas , and from then on , i could n't be seen talkin ' to him anywhere in vegas , or even near it .

all right .

bullshit or no bullshit , they put you in that book , you 're gon na be in a lot of trouble . you will not be able to walk into the casino . i 'm tellin ' you .

i 'm - i 'm hearin ' things from security . they 're all ex-cops . the sheriff 's lookin ' to bust your balls . they want to put you in the black book .

between ...

you 're still eight pounds over . what 's the reason for this ?

he insulted billy . and then i walked over to him politely ...

... nicky was dreamin ' his own kind of vegas .

you find any cash in there , we 'll whack it up with you .

hello .

you know , i do n't feel like playin ' tennis .

this is jennifer and nick . they 're dear friends of mine .

come on . there we go . look at that . beautiful .

ace , listen to me .

she 's a fuckin ' junkie . she 's out of her fucking mind . do you unders-

you 've got to stop her .

i-i 'm sorry , sam .

... and she does n't always -

never mind the 'sir ' . never mind the 'sir ' .

no , just - just give him , give him ten . that 's it . ten . i 'll be right down .

why not make them happy ?

i wo n't let her in . i 'm sorry , randy , i 'm not gon na let her in . she - well , i 'm not gon na let her in , the way she 's behaving . i 'm - i 'm -

you 're gon na be sorry if you do n't stop that .

get down here and talk to me , goddamn it ! do n't fuckin ' ignore me ! you motherfucker !

i would n't -

and what ? and let you disgrace me , you fuckin ' pig ? and let you disgrace me ? get up . get up and be a mother . get in the car and go to the house ...

you want your jewelry ?

let me tell you something . listen to me .

i can back him off .

all right ... i did n't have lunch with jennifer .

to the riviera .

i am not ! she 's my daughter too ! goddamn you !

yeah , no kidding . good ! it opens at 9 a.m. be there !

you hate my guts ? i want you to come with me now .

plus , at the most , three suits , a thousand apiece . that still leaves what ? around ten thousand ?

yeah .

what do you mean ?

yeah , they 're gon na kidnap my kid . what do you want ?

oh , god . oh , god . okay . okay ... i 'll try . i 'll try .

listen . ginger . i 'm tryin ' to make the best of everything here , you know ? i mean , you 're my wife , for chrissakes . uh , i mean ... people look up to you in this town . i do n't know what to think -

look - for my ulcer , i take a half a one of these , a half a one of these . and that 's when i have extreme pain . i had a three-month supply . what 'd you do with 'em ?

i did n't take your pills .

is n't it bad enough you 're drinkin ' too much , you 're takin ' all my pills too ?

you remember when you called him that night ? when you said goodbye to him ? he did n't say , 'do n't get married , i 'll be right down , we 'll get married . ' he did n't say that to you , did he ?

you can trust me .

you 're askin ' me for twenty-five thousand . i 'm not out to make you feel bad . i want to just be able to trust you . you now , it 's about trust . i have to be able to trust you with my life . do you understand ? can i trust you ? can i trust you ? ... can i trust you ? ... answer me . can i trust you ?

... they did n't know what really moved her .

okay .

oh , it 's so soft .

i 'm forty-three years old . i do n't want to wait . i know you well enough to know that i really love you very much . and i ca n't think of anybody better to be with . and i do n't feel like waiting anymore .

within no time , everything was set in place . we got rid of the freelance scamsters . the per was way up . the gods were happy , or as happy as the gods can ever be . and i , i decided to complicate my life . for a guy who likes sure things , i was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot .

thanks a lot .

... and hypocrisy .

what are you running for , bob ? what are you running for ?

... well , i 've got a large family .

hey ... ward , you 're pissin ' me off . now , you 're insulting my intelligence . what do you think , i 'm a fuckin ' idiot ? you know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin ' reels .

mr rothstein .

green ?

i mean , if i ca n't work in vegas , where am i gon na go ?

all right , i 'm gon na give you a choice . you can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here . you ca n't have both . what do you want ?

can you do it with your left hand ?

i just wan na get out of here .

you know ... i think that you 've gotten the wrong impression about me . i think in all fairness , i should explain to you what it is that i do . for instance , tomorrow morning i 'll get up nice and early , take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you , and , uh ... if you do n't have my money for me , i 'll crack your fuckin ' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank . and just about the time that i 'm comin ' out of jail , hopefully , you 'll be comin ' out of your coma . and guess what ? i 'll split your fuckin ' head open again . because i 'm fuckin ' stupid . i do n't give a fuck about jail . that 's my business . that 's what i do . and we know what you do , do n't we , charlie ? you fuck people out of money and get away with it .

mr ro- mr roth- mr rothstein , where you goin ' -

lady , i ca n't . i ca n't . i ca-

i 'll to the fbi !

it 's instinctive , you know .

yeah , well , that 's exactly what i keep tellin ' him , but that 's the kind of kid he is ever since he 's born .

... metro intelligence cop . but it did n't matter . i mean , it was all about the kids , you know .

now go out there and show your dad what you can do .

ace got my son , little nicky , involved with little league , and it was great .

he 's comin ' over .

i had my kid brother , dominick , run it for me .

yeah , we 're lookin ' for carmine .

oh .

yeah , i 'm over here with him .

i 'm over here now .

you see ... i would n't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends . you understand ?

yeah , i know . that 's why i 'm asking . you see , my main concern is nicky .

so , i lied ... even though i knew that by lyin ' to gaggi , i could wind up gettin ' killed too .

it 's private ... but i want you to tell me the truth .

keepin ' remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world .

i do n't need you ! i have my own fuckin ' money !

nicky , please ...

mm ... okay . do n't worry about it . nobody 'll fuck with ya anymore . i 'll take care of ya .

yeah .

you know ?

yeah ?

what were you gon na say ? go ahead .

oh , you 're right , i know . it 's ... well , i was just -

yeah , uh-huh ... okay .

you 're a beautiful girl . you do n't want to ruin your looks . i 've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff .

listen , ginger ... you know , this is probably not ... i do n't have the answers anyway ... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now , because you 're a little upset with ace .

sure .

you know ... the first time i ever saw your guys together ... i never saw him so happy . i mean , i know he 's a crazy jew fuck and everything , but ...

oh , you did ? i did n't know that .

... same outfit .

well , you might as well get somethin ' out of it .

what do you mean 'stole ' ? i did n't steal anything from you .

what money ? look at this stack of chips . do n't give me that shit . i want my end .

i told you i was hot tonight .

he called you right here .

that 's right .

i love you .

i 'm here .

they check in alone ?

god , i 'm telling you , they 're out !

two .

yeah , just let me know . but you got ta be ready . you know what i 'm talkin ' about ?

i do n't trust him anymore . but they 'd never okay anything , you know ?

i told him i did n't know nothin ' . but jiggs and , uh , tony gorilla said if you did anything , you 're fucked up .

what ? get out of here ? i got a marker comin ' .

... bosses . i mean , they 're smokin ' their di nobilis and they 're eatin ' a trippa [ italian-american slang for 'tripe ' . ] and fuckin ' suffritt ' , you know , fried pigs guts ? while , if i wan na talk private , i got ta go to a fuckin ' bus stop .

but he never talked .

yeah , thanks a lot .

nicky sends his warmest regards .

whenever we got local merch , we 'd usually send it to palm spring or arizona ... la . i had a couple of sand niggers out there . you know , arabs .

you jag-off .

kill you , you motherfucker you ! frankie , do him a fuckin ' favor .

ch-charlie m !

fuck you !

your fuckin ' head , huh ? do n't fuck around , tony .

all right , yeah . you got that thing for me ?

all right , all right . but i - i -

take it easy , though .

... behind my head . they trust that scumbag , i do n't . right now , the way i feel , i 'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin ' shovel .

receipts and bills and ... everything 's here .

hey ! oh !

adonis , be polite . she 's a friend .

crowd always buys it . what do we got ?

sorry , sir . the cult is my life and my life is the cult . by god , captain god , i shall not fail you..

we 'll hunt him down together ...

no-o . you know , questions like that do n't help your cause --

tonight , somewhere in the city , innocent people will die -- but then one of you knows that ; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero captain god .

what 's the matter ? what are you saying ?

i 'm sorry i went off like that , i get passionate . i -- i guess i 'm a passionate person . one of those things i had forgotten . when you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero ?

stop . we are not having a `` duality '' conversation . `` ooh , he has a secret side . ooh , she has a dark side . '' please . duality is a joke . you get one , do you understand me ? you get one life . one shot . i 'm so tired of women saying `` i have an inner strength '' or `` deep down , i 'm really ambitious . '' `` one day i 'll design my own line of clothing and write children 's stories , if i can only remember to return the videos i rented last night . '' if you are something , then you better be out there doing something . you need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night -- with maybe a slight clothing change . there is no gray area . the truth is not somewhere in between . there are two sides to every personality , all right -- the reality ... and the lie . we are not having a `` duality '' conversation .

i 'm not afraid . are you ?

i 'll bet the butler 's name was n't `` jeff . ''

quiet , blender boy . i told you from the beginning , selina , i 'm not a very good liar . i am not captain god , or whatever else he may be calling himself this month , but when i find out who is -- the man will pay . my sister died in that museum attack . you can check the atlanta obituaries . i 've tracked these monsters from city to city , waiting for a time to exact my revenge . why else would i come to oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world ?

your uniform , that first time i saw you , was a ghastly cage i vowed to unlock in order to..

a bit on the suspicious side , do n't you think ?

can i just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are , mr. architect ? i just love risking electrocution every time i..

oh , how long have you had your own route ?

winning .

yeah ... pretty gross . hurry , we 've got work to do .

of course it matters ! it throws off everything ! `` superhero '' is manhood 's highest achievement . manhood ! your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core . you were my buddy , my comrade -- women are n't buddies , women are n't warriors ! you tried to turn the cult of good into some after-work softball team ! it 's time to get thrown from the treehouse ...

just like a woman . you want out . you 're out .

ah , the good guys always triumph in the end . it 's what allows our children to sleep at night .

you 're not strong . you 're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you . whatever the cult of good was , it 's not anymore ... you do n't have to listen to me , just listen to you..

i do n't want to hurt you , catwoman . yet . after tomorrow , you can do anything you want , but please , just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours . i wo n't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you . i warn you , do n't tempt captain god when he is angry . let is complete our mission in peace .

hello , spooky .

what 's the good news ?

we have to do something . what can we do to help , selina ?

i 'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city 's tourists . the mayor , in his finite wisdom , is throwing a `` month of the woman '' luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down . i thought maybe you and i could ...

did you try to kill ...

hey , captain god !

well . i 'd let you come in , but the place is a mess ...

ah ! ah ! -- god no , do n't tell me you 're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects..

oh now this one is mine ...

do you always listen to what your mother says ? selina . something you choose your life . sometimes your life chooses you . save the day..

mom , not now ! i , i do n't know what to do..

i would appreciate a little space . thank you .

what are you doing on theo 's line ?

did you have to tell her my name ?

she ca n't ! it 's busted . now hand that on back !

i 'm the one they 'd be looking for .

which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law . these are people who do n't worry about reading you your rights .

why would i do that ?

put those away . we ca n't have marks on his wrists .

you can tell she was really worried about me .

look , i 've got a wife . i do n't care if either of you ever get caught .

sure -- and they record your voice . and later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder . that 's out !

let 's hope so . once you come out and okay everything i 'll give caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over .

not this minute .

give me 20 minutes at least .

lose the hardware now .

what am i supposed to do ?

i 'm doing fine . theo wants to deal .

i had it in my mind what you 'd look like . `` her , '' i could 've painted . < u > you < /u > , i 'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors .

think you could do a picture of me ?

what 's happening ?

they 'll have units blocking us up ahead .

let me talk to him . hold the phone to my ear -- but do n't nudge me .

plus names , addresses and i.d . for the lot of you . we 're in this together and i need to know who my partners are . in case i ever need to roll over on somebody .

you would n't --

you wo n't shoot me . that 's not your style .

sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here .

the video cameras will put you with him in the bank , and i 'll bet there were enough witnesses .

damned if i know .

jack oberfeld in person . did you kill him ?

for christ sakes do n't point it at me . we want to get rachel out of there in one piece . i 'm waiting for the girl . her mother wants to talk to her .

so far they 're keeping their part of it .

they tortured us . and you 're going to let them have all that money ?

it 's locked .

i ca n't do it .

i had a little encounter at the bank and our mr. transplant ended up under the wheels of a chevy .

when they first started questioning jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me . and they began beating him . and i watched . and i did n't feel anything ... what kind of a person am i ?

to hide it from the i.r.s .

you 're doing what you can . why 's all this money stashed ?

it 's not hard to do . i do it all the time .

jack will negotiate with them . he 'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they 'll let rachel go .

i 'm cutting across to bundy to brentwood . that bank is our best bet . if anybody shows up i could follow them .

what do you mean ?

i 'm making my turn . i see the school up ahead .

i 've lost you . you 're gone . i ca n't hear anything .

just hang on . i 've got a life of my own .

he 's right . you 'll get my whole family killed .

bottom line ! there 's nothing i can do for you but tip the cops .

oh man . these people mean business .

what makes you say that ?

no ! no police . they 'll know right away the authorities are looking for us . they 'll kill us . we 've seen their faces .

no -- nothing .

do n't expect me to tell you who i am .

i do n't believe you .

yeah . why do n't we ?

i 'm backing up .

i 'm not accepting criticism today . now do n't make me lose count . there 's already a half million in this portfolio .

they saw you kill the driver .

we 're gon na get there first .

then you can sue the cops . collect from both ends . tighten your belts . here it comes . ready ?

you want us to get ourselves killed ?

there 's two police cars now .

sure , i end up with some cash . and a lot of bonds i do n't know how to dispose of .

if he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus lenore here .

what 's he doing ? answer me !

if you were n't going for a spare what were you doing ?

what kind of treasury dept . business is this ?

you 've got a < u > phone < /u > ?

you see that , col ?

i would expect he does .

yeah . i heard . you hear , jimmy ?

you heard me --

c'mon , babe ! you know what i like ... easy !

whatever it is she does for you .

do n't call me that --

you will , dil

fergus .

i like you , dil

let me go for fuck 's sake , dil -- or they 'll be here

do n't you want to kill me ?

i suppose i tried .

lifted him from a carnival in belfast . held him hostage for three days .

i 'm going home !

why are we going here , jimmy ?

do n't call me that --

i 'm sorry .

she 's the thing you had to tell me .

what 's her ?

come on .

should have stayed a girl .

sorry .

i should have known , should n't i ?

whenever . tonight .

what is this ?

want to look after you .

did he dance with you ?

did he come here too ?

yes .

tell me about him .

someone out there .

you on the game ?

not you . how quaint . how old-fashioned and quaint . is n't it , col ?

does n't the water get to your nails ?

what 's his name ?

who ?

a bit heavy on the powder , is n't she , jimmy ?

yeah . just checking . he being nice to you , dil ?

what was it ?

aha .

and then you 'll leave her out of it ?

och , you do , fergie .

poke him or something . see if he 's still alive .

horny bastard .

whoever hits him 'll be hit , if those men are any good . and i presume you ca n't get in .

why ?

so ?

give him a cup of tea .

the fastest .

hurling 's a fast game , is n't it , fergus ?

i thought as a child . but when i became a man i put away childish things ...

and the scorpion . no . tell me anything .

do n't .

if they kill me --

some kinds of women are ...

yes .

having a pint in the metro , and dil 's having a margarita .

so what 's that supposed to mean ?

now , that was worth waiting for .

ca n't .

i 'll bear that in mind .

never .

what the fuck were you doing here ?

okay . that nice lady . meets me in a bar . i 'm saying what the fuck am i doing here anyway . she buys me a drink . she holds my hand . i 'm looking at her saying i do n't like you , bitch . but what the fuck . maybe i 'll get to understand .

you fuckers set me up . that bitch --

so what were you fucking around for , then ?

she your wife ?

absolutely not .

she 's mine . anyway , she would n't suit you .

did n't look like that to me ...

i did n't even fancy her .

and you know the funny thing ?

i 'm talking about your people , not you .

yeah . and the brown eyes .

you did n't ?

you do n't know me , do you ?

you 're crazy . do n't let him , peter .

first her husband , now her -- she hoodwinked you ! she batted all them big eyes and you went ' n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken ! here ! you want ? here -- it 's yours !

all right -- where 's the letter ?

never mind -- i 'll go by myself .

all right , prove it to me -- tell me to go to the embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps .

and that 's all the gratitude i get for saving your hide .

here , give it to me .

i 'm through listening to you !

it 's hopeless -- i do n't even know what we 're looking for .

nothing 's wrong . i think i found something . i was snooping around tex 's room and i found this in the waste basket . i 've stuck it back together .

no , it 's all right . what 's wrong , adam ?

lord , you 're stubborn .

let 's look anyway .

relax -- you 're gaining .

i thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out .

that 's right .

are you sure there 's no mistake ?

i told them what you said -- about this man being carson dyle 's brother . i asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you 're not gon na like this , mrs. lampert -- they told me carson dyle has no brother .

go ahead , mr. bartholomew -- i 'm listening .

yes -- ?

me ? why me ?

we 're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself dyle .

i would n't advise that , mrs. lampert . you 'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave . those men wo n't be very far away -- no matter where you go . in fact , i do n't even see any point in your changing hotels . please help us , mrs. lampert . your government is counting on you .

please go on , mr. bartholomew -- what happened then ?

gratine , choucroute garnie , salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge .

that 's not carson dyle .

describe him .

he 's hardly my mr. dyle .

i believe you .

you 're charles voss 's wife -- now that he 's dead you 're their only lead .

his -- real -- ?

you mean spies and things like that ?

charles lampert 's widow -- yes ? last time i sent out a tie only the spot came back .

that 's a face you do n't forget -- he was there too --

no .

yes .

brian .

but he 'd have to . if he left he 'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened . whoever it is has to wait here , pretending to look for the money , waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home . that 's when he 'll be safe and not a minute before .

how long do you intend -- ?

you 'll wreck your raincoat .

no -- he 's not the same . alexander dyle was interested in clearing up his brother 's death . adam canfield is a crook . and with all the advantages you 've got -- brains , charm , education , a handsome face --

but i do believe it -- that 's what i do n't believe . so it 's goodbye alexander dyle -- welcome home peter joshua .

you mean , you 're a thief ?

i do n't understand you at all -- one minute you 're chasing me around the shower room and the next you 're accusing me of murder .

got you .

no , about scobie , i mean . i ca n't think of any reason why he was killed .

i 'd love some , thanks .

what -- like scobie ?

women . you know , i ca n't help feeling rather sorry for scobie . would n't it be nice if we were like that ?

who ?

hello , herman , it was a happy landing , i see .

lord , i forgot all about it -- sylvie works late tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me . they would n't do anything to a little boy , would they ?

cutting it out .

what are you doing ?

i 'm not fifteen .

i 'm sorry i could n't tell you the truth , but i had to find out your part in all this .

alexander .

did n't anyone ever tell you it 's impolite to -- what happened ?

yes , he is . he was my brother .

do you mind if i sit down ? what about the blue one ?

i was expecting you . you are american too , of course .

you know i 'd tell you if i had it .

and if it is ?

she is n't going to be anybody 's mother unless you answer some questions .

what do you want ?

yes . your appointment has been changed . one key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen -- one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder -- that is all .

we took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought , perhaps , we would learn something .

you loved him ?

do you tell lies ?

how about once more around the park ?

what your husband was mixed up in .

what was it ?

you have n't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there ?

having a nervous breakdown .

fun and games . evidently we 're the floorshow .

the man and the woman are married --

i 'm still having trouble with english .

is there a mrs. joshua ?

please , not on my account .

no , it is n't . i 'm getting a divorce .

good for you .

why , do you think we 're going to ?

no -- no , i 'm do n't .

miz lampert , ma'am ...

hold it -- italy just finished . they 're recognizing great britain .

he 's allergic to him .

shoot no , not after all these years .

one more time .

me too . i 'm going to start telling people that i saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector .

i wonder why it 's so important to know if they fucked ?

better than a pile of dead teenagers .

so you just do n't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex .

you are upset .

no honey .

should we close down any eruption ?

did you warn her ?

i 've been in a lot of people 's houses and this one 's the creepiest .

can you describe her ? how old was she ?

she works at a church ?

daddy ... .

no . hell , it 's the quietest goddamn party i 've ever seen .

please get out of my way or i 'll have to hurt you .

what ?

i was born nine months after she was raped . one of the four men who raped her is my father . i have no idea which one .

did n't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time ?

i wo n't .

you ca n't tell your parents .

shh . ben 's party . tonight . have n't you heard ?

i doubt it . who 'd want to fuck her . she probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties .

no ! that 's his table .

i do n't watch him eat everyday .

why ?

of course . no one ever shuts up in the libary . kids were whispering about it all day .

quick ! in the house . he wo n't look for us in there .

thanks for coming back for me .

he 's dead ! we 've got to get the fuck out of here !

jody , you 're only doing this to get back at your dad . it does n't have that much to do with me .

you flaunt some slut in my face .

my dad acts like he 's johnny fucking perfect and he 's really johnny fucking rapist .

i 'm not using him as an excuse .

i got to get home .

cut it out .

who ?

who were they ?

i want you to come home with me right now , jody .

hi mom .

i 'm worried about someone .

i guess so . luckily we wo n't have that problem .

there 's going to be very few virgins left in school on monday . it could be really dangerous for them if the killer is n't caught .

jake , for christ 's sake .

the future , mr. gittes . the future . now where 's the girl ? ... i want the only daughter i have left ... as you found out , evelyn was lost to me a long time ago .

hollie was always fond of tide-pools . you know what he used to say about them ?

just find the girl .

if mulwray was murdered , she was probably one of the last people to see him .

... exactly what do you know about me , mr. gittes ?

far as it goes . of course he has to swim in the same water we all do .

very .

if you were a bank president that would be one thing , but in your business it 's admirable . and it 's good advertising .

always ?

i said horseshit . horseshit .

of course i do . where are you ?

do you remember the figures we discussed ?

hello .

you sure this is okay ?

tell mrs. mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there . then if i do n't show , take her down to the boat .

thanks , mr. gittes .

you know , you 're okay , mr. gittes . i know it 's your job , but you 're okay .

how do they do that ?

gee , lou , i 'm doing the best i can .

matter of fact i do .

they only dump the water at night .

it 's too late .

mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody did n't want his body found in the ocean .

no , he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people . but they were n't very important , just a bunch of dumb mexicans living by a dam . now beat it , gittes , you do n't come out of this smelling like a rose , you know .

since i made lieutenant .

summer colds are the worst .

i do n't think so , mrs. mulwray . of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information , we 'll be in touch .

no .

obviously the fall must have knocked him out .

let me handle that .

... where does kyo live ?

where can we go ?

you ca n't go by train . escobar 'll be looking for you everywhere .

she 's my sister .

i said the truth !

stop it ! i 'll make it easy . you were jealous , you fought , he fell , hit his head . it was an accident , but his girl is a witness . you 've had to pay her off . you do n't have the stomach to harm her , but you 've got the money to shut her up . yes or no ?

upstairs . why ?

where 's the girl ?

... that 's not what i meant .

that 's not what it looks like , mrs. mulwray .

c'mon , mrs. mulwray . you 've got your husband 's girlfriend tied up in there !

you bastard .

do ? to who ?

what did he say ? what did he say ?

just ... i have to .

working for the district attorney .

actually this has n't happened to me in some time .

easy , it 's an innocent question .

is that unusual ?

and hollis knew about it ?

yeah . they 've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts . have any idea what this land 'll be worth with a steady water supply ? about thirty million more than they paid .

everything you can see , everything around us . i was at the hall of records today . that bother you ?

the valley ?

no ! ... yes , a little . you see hollis and my fa ... my father had a falling out ...

he told you ?

how did you find out ?

mr. gittes ... do n't tell me how i feel .

yes , mr. gittes ?

iced tea .

is n't everybody ? what can i do for you , miss sessions ?

just , if you will , confine yourself to the main building . it 's nearly bedtime .

oh my goodness .

i do n't want to nail you . i just want to know who put you up to it . i 'll give you a few days to think it over . call me . i can help . who knows ? maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years .

yes ...

well , whitey mehrholtz over at the times will . dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought . that 's news .

mr. gittes ! that 's an outrageous accusation . i do n't know what you 're talking about .

well , look at it this way , mr. yelburton . mulwray did n't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around , so . you decided to ruin it . then he found out that you were dumping water every night . then he was drowned .

maybe he takes it very seriously .

ida sessions wants to see you .

then go home and forget about it .

never heard of 'em ... new owners ?

yes . yes , they were partners .

he owned the water department ?

mr. yelburton will be busy for some time .

it 's personal . has he been out long ?

no , no . she said not to call , her husband might answer .

yeah .

what about ?

this ?

cross was looking for her all over the country . offered rewards , everything . felt real sorry for him , with all his money .

well , you never know , do you ?

she ran away ?

you must be thinking of a different daughter .

thanks for all you 've done for me .

they tell me you never go out , never talk to anybody . why ?

eh ! love ... what a mystery ! i understand you , toto ... the ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful . whatever you do , you ca n't make friends with them . eh , there 's nothing to be done about it ! the heavier a man is , the deeper his footprints . and if he 's in love , he suffers , because he knows he 's up a one-way street . because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants ...

peppinoooo ! come back sooon ! ! good thing germany 's closer than russia .

i bought a ticket . i 've come to see the film .

he was n't crazy . in the beginning i was upset . i think i really hated him . but then , with time , i understood what he said ... and your silence too .

oh , how i looked for you , elena ! you 'll never know . i wrote , telephoned , nothing . nobody ever answered . but i dreamt of you for years ! that 's why i went away ... and never came back here . even as the years passed , in all the women i met , i was only looking for you . i had success it 's true , but there was always something missing ... i 'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me . a crazy lunatic !

all things considered , yes . even if it was n't what i dreamt of then ...

of course i remember him . i 'm sorry . you were terribly fond of him .

he wo n't be convinced , salvatore . he has other plans for me .

i do n't care . i 'll wait .

elena . my name 's elena .

it takes years to get there . and years to come back ... now go to bed , toto , it 's late .

i do n't remember him any morema , where 's russia ?

huh ? oh , i forgot - you 've been away so long i forgot about your joking -

but please , mr. kane , do n't buy any more paintings . nine venuses already we got , twenty-six virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -

say , with them fellows - - it 's no trick to get circulation .

let 's hope they like it there .

i 'll write it myself .

ready for dinner , brad ?

re-figure it , mr. bernstein , at two cents .

three cents .

i ordered six already this morning ! got a discount !

get me a typewriter . i 'll finish the notice .

yes . i thought it was a good idea . we 've covered it from the news end , of course .

that 's a long story .

well , why do n't you , mr. bernstein ? you know mr. leland .

i suppose he 's fixing it up - i know i 'd never get that through .

mr. kane is finishing it .

yes , mr. bernstein .

go and get yourself washed up , mr. bernstein . there does n't seem to be an serious injury .

certainly not .

sixty-two thousand -

you just made the paper over four times today , mr. kane . that 's all -

wasted ?

i 've been a newspaperman my whole life and i do n't intend - - if it 's your intention that i should continue to be harassed by this - this - i warn you , mr. kane , it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but i would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted .

that 's one of the things i think must be changed , mr. carter . the news goes on for twenty-four hours a day .

i 'm going to live right here . as long as i have to .

i 'm protecting myself every way i know how , mrs. kane . this last week , i finally found out how i can stop your husband from being elected . if the people of this state learn what i found out this week , he would n't have a chance to - he could n't be elected dog catcher . well , what i 'm interested in is seeing that he 's not elected . i do n't care whether they know what i know about him . let him keep right on being the great , noble , moral - champeen of the people . just as long as -

hello , brad -

too late for what ? too late for you and this - this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me ? well , you wo n't do it , i tell you . you wo n't do it !

i 'm not interested in the voters of this state right now . i am interested in - well , junior , for one thing .

i do n't see what else you can do , charles . if he 's right - and the papers publish this story he has -

here i am , darling ... darling ! ... darling , it 's all right ... mother 's here .

do n't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this ? that you 've packed your bags and ordered the car and -

i 'll discuss what 's on my mind when i want to . you 're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it .

i 'm not going to have my guests insulted , just because you think - - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic , that 's their business . you 've got no right -

ca n't we go back , charlie ?

yes . the bulldog 's just gone to press .

yes , i would . that 's why i asked .

who am i ? well , let 's see . charles foster kane was born in new salem , colorado in eighteen six - i run a couple of newspapers . how about you ?

and i know too many people . obviously , we 're both lonely . would you like to know where i was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my sunday clothes ?

no . but you 're close .

i ca n't stay here all night chasing your pain away .

where 's the soap ?

thanks .

if you want to come in and wash your face - i can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -

you 're making a bigger fool of yourself than i thought you would , mr. kane . you 're licked . why do n't you -

you do anything you want to do . the people of this state can decide which one of us to trust . if you want to know , they 've already decided . the election tuesday 'll be only -

i know the facts , mr. kane . and i happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean . you 're a man of great talents , mr. kane .

i 'm not suggesting anything , mr. president ! i 've come here to tell you that , unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks !

your job is n't to give mrs. kane your opinion of her talents . you 're supposed to train her voice . nothing more .

they 're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who 's got more than ten cents in his pocket . they 're -

i came to see you , charles , about your - about the enquirer 's campaign against the metropolitan transfer company .

oh , yes , sir .

yes , mr. kane .

ca n't say , sir .

hey , brad ! i 've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let 's have another brandy .

she 's going to leave you -

how would the `` enquirer '' look with no news about this non-existent war - with benton , pulitzer and heart devoting twenty columns a day to it ?

charles , i tell you there is no war ! there 's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -

the `` chronicle '' is a good newspaper .

it 's been a tough day .

poor mr. carter !

rogers is n't even pretending . he is n't just scared anymore . he 's sick . frank norris told me last night he has n't known rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years .

oh , yes , the bonus .

what do you mean by that ?

you 're going to live with mr. thatcher from now on , charlie ! you 're going to be rich . your ma figures - that is , er - she and i have decided that this is n't the place for you to grow up in . you 'll probably be the richest man in america someday and you ought to -

it 's going to be done exactly the way i 've told mr. thatcher -

sure , mr. leland . i 'll be glad to .

that must have been love .

i can remember everything . that 's my curse , young man . it 's the greatest curse that 's ever been inflicted on the human race . memory - i was his oldest friend . as far as i was concerned , he behaved like swine . maybe i wasnt ' his friend . if i was n't , he never had one . maybe i was what nowadays you call a stooge -

maybe you could remember something that -

how do you do , charles ?

charles , my name is mr. thatcher -

i want you to stop all this nonsense , jim .

i know , but -

well , thanks a lot .

i did a lot of singing after that . i sang for charlie - i sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that , i did n't -

think again !

it 's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung . keep it .

if you 're going to drink it in here , i 'd appreciate it if you 'd not bother the customers .

fifty-five .

how long have you been a smoker ?

awww . that was so cute .

such a sordid state of affair .

few are . so what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with dante this time around ?

what can i say ? he does weird things to me .

call the police .

like what ?

i 'll ask randal to close up for me when he gets back .

i offer you my body and you offer me semantics ? he 's just a boyfriend , dante , and in case you have n't gotten the drift of why i came all the way here from ohio , i 'm about to become single again . and yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision , for which i 'll probably be ostracized at both school and home . you ask me who i choose , i choose you .

jerk . here i am , throwing myself at you , succumbing to your wily charms , and you call me a slut , in so many words .

i hear that 's a rather popular date .

you have a better suggestion ?

the dante hicks dinner and a movie date . i think i 've been on that one before .

we could introduce them . they might hit it off .

jesus , you 're caustic .

you lie .

there 's more , is n't there ?

if he 's so nice , why are n't you going to marry him ?

yeah , but not seriously . christ , you 're ready to walk down the aisle- i 'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody .

let 's not talk about that . how 'd you get home ?

when did you get back ?

yes .

how 'bout covering point ! ? you suck !

fuck that ! i 'm gon na break my crazy neck on this ladder !

shit !

you only brought one ball ? !

if you grab a gatorade , then everybody 's going to grab one .

i 'll call you . let you know .

do you work tomorrow ?

you need a ride ?

fuck you . fuck you , pal . listen to you trying to pass the buck again . i 'm the source of all your misery . who closed the store to play hockey ? who closed the store to attend a wake ? who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one ? you wan na blame somebody , blame yourself . `` i 'm not even supposed to be here today . '' you sound like an asshole . whose choice was it to be here today ? nobody twisted your arm . you 're here today of your own violation , my friend . but you 'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if dante was n't here . well , i got news for you , jerk : this store would survive without you . without me either . all you do is overcompensate for having what 's basically a monkey 's job : you push fucking buttons . any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs , but you 're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important , so much more epic than it really is . you work in a convenience store , dante . and badly , i might add . and i work in a shitty video store . badly , as well . you know , that guy jay 's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does . us ? we like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here , just looking to pick up a paper or-god forbid- cigarettes . we look down on them , as it we 're so advanced . well , if we 're so fucking advanced , then what are we doing working here ?

hermaphrodites ! i rented it so we could watch it together !

no , really . what did i do that was so wrong ?

why do you say that ?

point is-i 'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably .

so you 'll continue being miserable all the time , just because you do n't have the guts to face change ?

caitlin and i ca n't be together . it 's impossible .

i 'm satisfied with my situation for now . you do n't hear me bitching . you , on the other hand , have been bitching all day .

i should shit or get off the pot .

could be .

this is my way of spitting water at life .

wow . you 've had quite an evening .

i 'm not . she just left .

you 're happy to get a fine ?

as opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here .

holy shit . that girl ?

little girl . maybe five years old ?

i like to expand my horizons .

please , get the hell out of here .

what ?

what 's that for ?

so they 'll put her back in ! it 's not like it 's gon na matter if she breaks something !

does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose ?

you knocked the fucking casket over , for chrissakes !

i ca n't help it . at least when we were playing hockey outside , i could see if anyone wanted to go in .

i could never reach .

balls resting on his lips .

broke his neck .

that 's nothing compared to how my cousin walter died .

you were saying ?

i 'm not taking you to this funeral .

i 'm not missing what 's probably going to be the social event of the season .

you 've got ta watch the store . i have to go to this .

number six .

sanford 's brother dates her cousin . he found out this morning .

`` it 's not like we 're gon na sell out . ''

bitch , bitch , bitch . you want something to drink ?

are you gon na lock the store ?

i just want to play hockey like i was scheduled to .

i told him i had a game today . it 's his own fault .

do n't yell at me , pal .

i heard you apologize . why ? you have every right in the world to be mad .

all of them .

let 's hear it .

the jizz-mopper 's job is to clean up the booths afterward , because practically everybody shoots a load against the window , and i do n't know if you know or not , but cum leaves streaks if you do n't clean it right away .

why does n't he just mix and match ?

exactly . in order to get it built quickly and quietly they 'd hire anybody who could do the job . do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main ? all they know is killing and white uniforms .

the second time around , it was n't even finished yet . they were still under construction .

and the second one was still being built when they blew it up .

there 's more ?

well , he 's like the pope for the dark side of the force . he 's a holy man ; a shaman , kind of , albeit an evil one .

there was something else going on in jedi . i never noticed it until today .

then i think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over .

i 'm serious . aside from the cheating , we were a great couple . that 's what high school 's all about-algebra , bad lunch , and infidelity .

chess team allan harris ? !

oh , my god .

i hit the lights and she freaks . turns out she thought i was brad michaelson .

i 'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is caitlin bree .

want something to drink ? i 'm buying .

i ca n't stand a voyeur . i 'll be back .

i ... i do n't believe this ...

all the time . that girl was like a rabbit .

yeah ?

you used to go out with her ?

nothing personal .

pay the good man . do n't you close soon ?

hell yes , whatever that means . now i 'm gon na head over to atlantic , drink some beers , get ripped , and- please god-get laid . e-z wider , one-and-a-halfs .

'bout the biggest pair you ever seen ! nynne ! !

do n't hurt yourself . i 'm going to big choice video instead .

it 's not like it 's a demanding job . i 'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch tv . the other day i walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping .

the porno mags ?

say , young fella , you know i hate to bother you again , but can i take a paper or something back there ... to read ? it usually takes me a while , and i like to read while it 's going on .

you 're damn right it 's not like that ! because i wo n't let it be like that ! you want your slut ? fine ! the slut is yours !

veronica ... i ... it 's not like that anymore ... i mean , it was never really like that ...

it was only a few times ...

you 've been talking to her on the phone for weeks !

good . i 'll see you when you close , then . enjoy the lasagne .

i called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow .

... it is n't there . yes .

um . thirty-seven .

what the hell is that anyway , `` something like thirty-six ? '' does that include me ?

i did understand ! i understand that you slept with three different guys , and that 's all you said .

because i did only sleep with three guys ! that does n't mean i did n't just go with people .

that 's because i never had sex with him !

like you said-she snowballed him .

sylvan made it up . it 's a blow job thing .

vegetable meaning paraplegic .

wow . that 's great . that 's something to be proud of .

something wrong ?

women ? women , as lovers , are all basically the same : they just have to be there .

theoretically , people see money on the counter and nobody around , they think they 're being watched .

who 's defensive ? just ... would you just hug me ? ! all right ? your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob , and he needs to be hugged .

i 'll throw this out . precautionary measure .

thanks . i thought i was gon na have to go to the hospital .

the due date is on the bottom . this summons can not be contested in any court of law . failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence , and a warrant will be issued for your arrest . have a nice day .

but i did n't sell cigarettes to any kid !

according to the njac-the new jersey administrative code , section eighteen , five , slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor .

yes . i 'm not out of shape .

what did he say ?

he really wants to play metal ?

yeah !

i just held up the same two movies . you 're not even paying attention .

i 'll see you there .

the only place i do n't bring my drugs is church . and that ai n't till sunday morning .

do n't hold it against him . he just never got caitlin out of his system . it 's not your fault . it 's dante . i do n't know thing one about chicks . do you want to cry or something ? i can leave .

i ... i do n't know what to say .

dental school .

next time you 're like watching mtv , y ' know , like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out . i mean , hey , we could be home watching some righteous pornos .

work ! do n't say that word , man .

hey , let 's get something straight . if i 'm gon na die , i 'm gon na die , but you 're always gon na be the asshole , so just shoot , alright .

answer the man .

where 's the radio ?

i admit , i can be bought .

bags ?

near freedom falls . she went for help .

if you want , do it . i do n't care .

no , buddy , it was you who dropped it !

we 'll never know , will we ?

there was n't time for anything else .

when we get this group down , i 'm gone .

sarah , hold on , he 'll have you in a second . jesus christ , grab her !

the clip 's not gon na hold !

i 'm coming out !

wait 'til you get into trouble , just wait .

glad you could drop in .

that 's it , you look like a professional .

sure you can .

is it really four thousand ?

sarah , we could take off and leave this guy behind ...

what do you think ? maybe i could reach the ledge without falling . no , forget it .

what about you ?

reach up ! do it !

hold on ! hold on ! reach up !

gabe !

these old ropes can hold 900 lbs. , each strand 300. i 'm 190 , you 're about 135 -- it just may hold .

what ?

if we do n't get out of here soon we can ask him in person .

what was god thinking when he built this place ?

sure , just give it back when you 're done .

no , actually it was more like mutual attacking .

only kidding ... < u > actually < /u > i attacked you .

can you think of something more romantic than attacked ?

that 's no good . it 'll be dark soon , there 's no other shelter for ten miles . if they show , they 'll take you too . why 'd you have to come up here ? !

thank god you did n't leave . we just got a mayday . seven climbers stranded off comb bluff . the weather 's pouring in fast and hal 's gone up alone .

it does n't matter , anywhere but here .

resuscitation ?

you 're saying , i do n't understand ? i 'm the < u > only < /u > one who does understand . i 'm the one you lived with for two years , i 'm the one you made promises to , i 'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all . believe me , there 's been times i did n't know what i wanted to do more , love you or hate you . but the one thing in our relationship that i did know and still do know is that i < u > understand you < /u > .

when you call me gabriel , i know i 've got trouble .

do n't believe it ... you know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter . everything you think just pours right out .

we spent a night there one night ...

wait , i think i have them sighted . what 's the word , frank ?

patience my love , patience .

i 'm touched . kristel , check the chopper , let 's go .

for christ 's sake , they 're kids .

no , he 's close , and he 's using our money to keep you alive . nobody 's worth that much on the open market . except you , the loyal one . did n't i tell you to warm the place up ?

jessie , i reached the top of the tower . so far , no sign of anyone . looks like a phoney call . over .

ryan , get a rope , i want the man on a leash , too .

go after her .

i told you , 50,000 possible keycode combinations , in fifteen second intervals .

why the hell are we wasting time here ? !

jessie ? looks like your friend found company .

he 's alive !

we ca n't and he knows it .

we agree on something . and for insurance , take his coat .

appreciate it .

been punished , yeah ?

impossible ... i do n't believe it .

yarbles , great bolshy yarblockos to you i 'll meet you with chain , or nozh or britva , any time , not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless . it stands to reason , i wo n't have it .

no , my health does n't allow it .

now listen here , you little bastard , just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in . alex eyes a giant white , fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him .

excuse me , missus , can you please help ? there 's been a terrible accident . can i please use your telephone for an ambulance ?

well , shall we get down to it ?

i 've got to rest , mum ... got to get fit , otherwise i 'm liable to miss a lot more school .

i 've just come back from the hospital . your victim has died .

tell me more , georgie boy .

appy polly loggies . i had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep . i was not awakened when i gave orders for awakening .

we always help our friends , do n't we ? it is no secret that the government has lost a lot of popularity because of you , my boy . there are some that think that at the next election we shall be out . the press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do .

helping you , sir ?

you must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate . not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered , but also because you are helping us .

we put him away where he can do you no harm . you see we are looking after your interests . we are interested in you , and when you leave here you will have no further worries . we shall see to everything ... a good job on a good salary .

good evening , my boy .

hullo lad . what a surprise , good to see you .

no , sir .

no , sir .

right . the mothballs , mister .

no , sir .

no , sir .

are you referring to the background score ?

i hope so . is that the end then ?

that 's right and i 'll smash your face for you , yarblockos . slide of watch shop .

i just say what the other person would say ?

well , when i was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like , i kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver . you know ... like the inside of me brain . i seemed to have this dream over and over again . d'you think it means anything ?

what are we going to do ? talk about me sex life ?

what 's all this about sin ?

and , father , i 've never been guilty of any institutional infractions , have i ?

fine , my boy , fine , fine .

enough is remembered though , little alex . dim and georgie laugh . they drag alex to a low water through .

aye . you should have let us know , lad , not that we 're not very pleased to see you again . all cured too , eh ?

how many to a cell ?

if this is a joke , it 's not funny .

no , no way , i could n't take that ...

you need a vacation .

but not now ?

like what ?

you got a deal .

first friday of the month ? linens . roll right off the trucks . they 're in and out in twenty minutes ... ... which means they left fifteen minutes ago . traffic will be smooth .

sixth is faster .

save me the grief . step out of the car , sir , and open the trunk .

a deer ?

i never lie . ask max . max , have i lied yet ?

jazz question . what other kind is there ? you get it right , we roll with it . you disappear . tonight . you do n't go home , you do n't pack a bag , you just leave town ... and nobody , i mean nobody , ever hears from you or sees you again .

unbelievable ... ... you hearing this ? unbelievable .

the fat man on cherry street . the other fat man , mr. bulldozer . the trumpet player . that leaves two .

tell me . has black peter already crossed off a few bad children ?

i see . that was an important list , would n't you say ? the people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge . and you `` lost '' it ?

... goddamn it , you telling me this motherfucker 's whacked three of our witnesses tonight ...

captain walt muldoon , nypd .

jesus . two in one night ?

cabbie had no criminal record , no history of mental illness . suddenly , he just wigs out and pops three people , then himself ? plus the victims were n't random solid citizens . they were all lowlives . wiseguys . i 've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab .

they found him dead in his own cab down by the port authority .

what thing ?

we 're gay lovers , what 's it to you ?

i know you 're out there ! answer the goddamn call !

... well , last i checked , you were < u > sleeping < /u > with me , so unless you wan na start fucking the guy soon , i 'd suggest an attitude shift ...

... what do you want me to do , punch him out ? i have to work with him ...

... i 'm sorry , i do n't see it that way ...

was your seatbelt fastened , honey ?

slow down !

... indifferent .

that 's the reason ?

you 're full of shit .

it 's what i do for a living .

no , not just that .

i do n't know .

damn , max . i 'm impressed . really . i would have bet good money you would n't walk out of there .

no . no way . i ca n't do this .

i do n't get it .

dmitri ?

yeah ? like what ? limos ?

he hated everything i did . hated me . got drunk and beat the shit out of me , daily ...

it 's cause they do n't like their lives , so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you ... i had a father like that .

you go every night ?

tell her i ca n't see her tonight , okay ?

let 's go .

tell him next time he pulls any shit , you 're gon na kick his fat ass .

hands on the wheel . ten and two o'clock , like they taught you in driver 's ed .

i 'll deal with it . i will , i will ...

who was he ?

i ching ? you threw a man out a window !

you do n't understand . i mean it . really . i 'm not up for this ...

they 're < u > somebody 's < /u > friends ... you drive a cab . i kill people . we both do our jobs right , you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead .

okay , try it now .

it 's not me , it 's the engine ! a fat guy fell on it from six floors up !

two ...

what ?

you cool , max ? say `` i 'm cool . ''

why not ?

it 's home .

first time in new york ?

an apology .

all i know is , they said to send you and the body to the basement .

i , uh , i have some problems .

sorry , flip . got sidetracked .

i got ta go , flip . thanks .

top pocket ... go on .

it 's okay . you ... you thought i was bad .

why ? what do these guys have to do with ezekiel walters ?

i do n't know what it was . all i know is i had a gun in my hand , but when i saw you standing with him , i could n't do it . if that 's love , it 's not so bad . i found a part of myself that day . i could n't go back .

did you kill my father ? !

that 's the last time you rode , is n't it ? do you think it was your fault ? is that why ?

you go . send me a postcard .

connecticut .

there 's a car following us . probably another one flanking us the next street over .

holes ? i do n't know what you 're talking about .

well , i 've been tracking them down all morning .

where 'd you get your subscribers ?

never mind . you 'd think i was making it up .

johnny dancer , right ? you do n't ride him anymore , do you ? not since your dad died .

he was murdered .

jerry , there 's something i have to ask you . actually about a hundred things , but we can make progress , if you answer one question . to my satisfaction .

was that who i thought it was ?

you have ten copies of the book , but you do n't know who the main character is ?

absolutely not . a good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy . if you can figure it out , they screwed it up .

surprise me .

you know why the grateful dead are always on tour ?

that 's it ?

do they have a secret handshake ?

that 's how a man would do it . i 'm not a man .

crown victoria . f.b.i . car . a legitimate tail .

dead or alive , they 'll stick me in there with oswald . another lunatic acting alone ,

i wo n't be here when you get back , but i 'll be in touch . and thanks .

you do n't have to burst in here every time , jerry . just call and make an appointment .

i better get going .

< u > nasa < /u > is going to kill the president of the united states with an earthquake .

the president 's in europe . tomorrow he 'll be in turkey . right along this fault line . they launched the space shuttle yesterday .

then i ca n't be hurt anymore .

we 've arranged for you to take the blame . everyone knows how you 've been harassing the poor girl .

that 's not what i mean . i want to see her .

i do n't understand .

i 'm still listening .

jerry told me he bit your nose .

we 're very specialized .

the truth shall make you free .

too bad . because i 'm terrible at 'yes . '

i need to speak with an agent lowry .

i do n't like it . something 's wrong .

no idea . honest . what are you going to do ?

where do you think jerry is ?

jonas builds assassins for a living . several of whom may be in place already . we 'd like to kill a few birds with one stone .

and jonas ?

can i talk to you a second ?

was n't my idea .

you do n't understand --

there is no abort procedure -- we do n't know how we turned the damn thing on , let alone how to turn it off .

he died ... ... in 1972 .

mike , because of the earth 's rotation we 're only in line with vega so many hours a day ; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations . if dr. arroway had n't moved quickly we could have lost key elements .

dr. arroway , let me first say --

last week , about 3 a.m. , fish -- dr. fisher -- was on a late shift , and he found her doing laundry .

what would you have me say , david ?

i 'm asking for your help , david . i want to go . they 'll need someone relatively young , unattached -- and probably a scientist . as the president 's science advisor you have enormous weight ... i 'm asking if you 'll support my candidacy .

i do n't understand .

we 've cracked it . lunacharsky found it .

i 'm going to convert mr. science-is- the-root-of-all-evil ? this is absurd , david . we have work to do here , i do n't have time to play babysitter to the god squad .

... arrangements also have to be made for the v.i.p.s coming in , mostly religious leaders ...

it 's hardly yesterday ; the signal 's been traveling for over twenty-six years . as for why ... i 'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there 's another message buried deeper in the signal .

then why have n't you detected any signals ? if , as you claim , there have been thousands , millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why has n't one signal gotten through ? it 'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through ; you 're welcome to stay until then .

meaning ...

ellie , i should have done this a long time ago , certainly before i left the n.s.f. , but i wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --

very well ; since my appointment he 's been made interim director .

because you cut it from the budget three years running .

how can that be ?

there 's no way of knowing . without a key -- a primer , to help us , maybe never .

dr. lunacharsky ... ?

hydrogen times pi ... got it . strong sucker .

j39 z186 ... ?

it 's incredibly rich . we 've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages ' ; right now we 're on 10,413 .

it 's beautiful .

there is no direct evidence , no .

that 's terrific , but there 's one problem : we do n't have the means to receive all the data on our own .

... all those voices ... you gather them all together . millions of intelligences in one consciousness ... and now we 're a part of it .

so we passed some kind of test ?

the scale ... it 's just ... so all the civilizations you detect ; they all end up coming here ?

so who ... ?

dad ... but tell me , how did ... i mean how can ... ?

on that old shortwave ? maybe on a clear night . come on now , under the covers .

hokkaido island .

i think whoever sent the message did it because they 're worried about us .

what 's that ?

not if you think like a vegan .

i 've had a long time to make enemies , dr. arroway . there are many governments , business interests , even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear . and i will grant them their wish soon enough ... but before i do , i wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who 've given -- from whom i 've taken so much .

why am i here , mr. hadden ?

you 're implying that the whole selection process is a sham ?

i thought you were here because you want to go .

like it or not .

maybe that 's the problem . i want ... a family , ellie . i want kids . a townhouse on l street instead of still living like a college kid . a real life . maybe that makes me a sellout but i do n't care anymore . it 's what i want .

please , you 're just as ambitious as i am , more --

'the work , ' jesus , ellie , ca n't there just once be more to life than the work ? okay , maybe that 's the only way to get the recognition , win the prizes --

we could be together again --

actually --

how close are you to getting this funding put together ?

please . any chance of that died the day david drumlin was appointed head of the n.s.f . i have been in contact with a few other seti people ; we 've been trying to find backing from private investors . i 've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there ...

... i keep telling myself okay , that 's just the price , you have to do your time doing shitwork before you 're allowed to get to the good stuff ... but if i have to catalog one more quasar ... god , i 've missed you .

peter valerian .

ellie , you 're the proof . you tell them your story . ultimately they 'll have no choice but to believe you .

i 'm not sure it 's come to that .

pretty ironic , huh ? i had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy ... just to find you .

it was quite a page turner .

i ca n't hear this now --

ellie --

i do n't consider you the enemy , ellie . i 'm not 'out to get ' technology . i only ask the question : does it have to have all the answers ? i look out there and i see so much emptiness ... people are so starved for meaning , and it 's something they just do n't seem to be getting from science .

i wo n't deny i was ambitious . when i had my ... experience ... i wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible . i 'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises . you did n't answer my question .

you 're willing to die for this .

relativity . explain this to me one more time ... even if you traveled near the speed of light , when you came back --

in other words .

yes . very much .

do you love your parents ?

look , i 'm a reasonable person , and reasonably intelligent . but this experience went beyond both . for the first time i had to consider the possibility that intellect , as wonderful as it is , is not the only way of comprehending the universe . that it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with .

can you try ?

for managing the truth . but the truth wo n't be managed , sir . it stops being the truth the moment you try .

y'know what ? fine . i guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there 's no quicker way to show them .

well . that would seem to decide it . like it or not , for the moment , anyway , it looks like we 're all in this together .

git movin ' , i said .

i do n't think you understand . we made a deal -- -

i got two years .

that 's good : he earned it .

you think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin ' and hollerin ' and high hopes , but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side . luke ?

a salesman ! cool hand luke a salesman ?

go git it , luke .

yes , boss . i got it right .

she 's on to him . you shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is , he kin run her crazy .

captain says to wait 'til the patrol gits here .

yeah , they sure do make a lot of cold , hard , noise , captain .

that 's right , captain . just passin ' the time .

what for ?

i 'm dyin ' . i 'm dyin ' .

shut up . let him eat . do n't pay them no mind , boy .

oh , man , did you see her ? did you see her ?

i 've done enough world-shakin ' for a while . you do the rest for me . send me a postcard about it .

whoee , it 's cold . wisht i had somethin ' to eat . bread , grits , beans even . soon 's we get to my house , we 're gon na have us one big meal and then i 'm gon na show you some farm girls that ...

they do n't know iff ' n to smile , spit or swallow .

nuthin ' ! a handfull of nuthin ' ! you stupid mullet-head . he beat you with nuthin ' ! just like today when he kept coming back at me .

i 'm gon na kill you , you go on ...

maybe he 's been chain-ganging too long .

back at it in the mornin ' . just need a little nap ...

one rule ! no throwing up . he throws up , you forfeit everything .

you ever eat fifty eggs ?

all the bears gon na be walking today .

a bunch . must be halfa dozen newmeat .

that is one mean lady . bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen .

man oh man .

stop that .

this is a big day for the guards . they get to remind us who 's boss .

you think you 've been working hard . this muther 'll break your back .

only kidding !

you bastard !

i 'm the only friend you 've got , darling , and i do n't intend to stop doing what i think is good for us .

gaahhd ! what a < u > cop < /u > ! you busted me ! the new one , in the marina . she has a police radio scanner . it 's always on . she turns it off , and then she has to turn it on again . she 's obsessed . she ca n't not listen to it , but she ca n't listen to it , so she makes me listen to it .

we 'll get the paramedics ...

the same as the first time ...

what pattern was that ?

i do n't have it ...

does n't work that way . you had your chance , now fuck yourself ...

i never carried a gun !

we know ... send the book to evidence ...

daryll lee cullum , he wrote that book , he wanted the lady to have it . they wo n't let him send it to her , so i 'm getting out , he asks me to deliver it in person , he says , put it on her pillow . it has all about how he tried to kill her .

i 'm trying to tell you . it 's on the lady 's pillow ...

where is it ?

you break into her apartment to deliver a gift ? where is it ?

what was that ? what am i hearing ? the sound of an epiphany , a sudden blinding insight ?

if there 's a one percent possibil- ity , can you live with yourself when he kills again ?

helen -- let go . you 've got to let go .

look . there 's the order : you wrote it : desalvo , bianchi & buono , berkowitz and dahmer . it 's going to be dahmer next . which means he 'll kill a man .

i just thought it was so -- unprofessional . of you both !

what 's that siren ?

this one , yes . i was always curious about these twisted little souls , but this is the first one i 've felt personally terrified of . he 's something new and unheard of . i do n't know what he wants .

consistency is the hobgoblin of < u > little < /u > minds . tell them to test for the chemicals found in windex . that 's a product for cleaning with ...

please thank inspector goetz for taking care of me last night .

ruben .

he 's going home . he slept over because i was a little anxious ...

he felt remorse . he covered her .

is it an ongoing case ?

would you want to work with us on this ?

i want to tell you it 's a great honor to meet you and talk to you .

if he 's not out , why are they here ?

do you have any evidence to report , ma'am ? do you know any of the victims ...

why do n't you shoot off the lock ?

will you stay ? please ? i 'm afraid to sleep ... i do n't want ... < u > him < /u > ... in my head ...

i know 'halloran . ' what 's the rest of it ?

it 's a game they like to play . berkowitz -- `` son of sam '' -- hung around the crime scene , talking to the cops . this one 's probably watching < u > you < /u > , laughing at you .

daryll lee cullum ? i do n't think so . if he 's escaped we 'd have the national guard , cops 'd be crawling through sewers . you 'd have a guard on your front door .

sir , doctor hudson and i see a pattern develop ...

lieutenant quinn .

you got that right , nikko , it 's none of your business .

it 's against your rules that i try to help a witness who 's scared shitless ? who 's ...

get the pictures , and casts of footprints .

absolutely .

order chinese for us and meet me the library ? anything but beef .

snotty neurotic bitch ...

so what have we got ?

the same as the firs two . definitely a serial .

you did n't say serial killer and i did n't say serial killer .

am i in charge of this thing ? or not .

i just got here . talk to you later ...

we were together six years , sir !

she does n't lie ! you sure you fed her ?

james .

not yet . it 's only beginning .

i thought that was you , up there .

i 'd better come with you , then . are you sure you can drive ?

yes . from wendel . to celebrate , the license approval for our air-charter firm . i forgot to tell you .

they consider this to be the airport hospital . this ward is reserved for air- crash victims . the beds are kept waiting .

when i first met vaughan , he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems . i do n't know what he is now .

is n't that rather too close ... ?

i 've found that i enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic . i like to look at it . yesterday i hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour . `` anywhere '' , i said .

they said it was here . they told me this morning .

really ? what kind of exhibition is it ?

where are you ?

it 's not the police . it 's the department of transport . internal politics . it 's a joke . they have no idea who we really are

i have a going-away gesture for you , too .

ok , good . that 's good . thanks an awful lot for everything , and for coming down here to see me off .

i do n't want to hear anymore .

what kind of place is this ?

but what am i going to do ?

oh , no , of course not .

and then the gold scroll or the black romanesque print ?

loaned you . and it 's only 'til you get out of here .

it 'll be fine .

what 's all the dreck ?

look , mom , i think i 've found the dress .

you know what , ruthie ? i better get back to my class , ok ?

he 's been looking everywhere for weeks , mom . it 's not that easy after you 've been locked away .

not even if it 's something positive ?

i was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask .

you too , mom .

you 've only known jake a few months .

tell us every detail .

how wonderful , darling . what does that mean for you ?

lie ?

it 's got a green dot on its back . i ca n't go to sleep with it watching me .

yeah ?

what are we going to do ?

and all the plans we have .

i guess we need to talk .

michael , calm down . please . it 's ok .

what is it ? are you ok ?

it was n't exactly a lie .

i think i should go home .

you go ahead and relax . i 'll cook .

promise . as long as we have steak .

i 'll be forced to tickle you .

what do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate ?

you 've got to see the kitchen first .

it 's tv heaven .

first off , you 'll need to go to target . and , let 's see , what should you buy ?

i saw paul leaving . did you do the dirty deed ?

just checking .

your family just met me .

it 's a good thing my family loves you .

we 'll get caught .

but you 're checking it out .

what are you looking to read ?

it 's no big deal . we all compare .

hey there . they 're showing `` groundhog day '' if you ...

what if it 's got a pattern ?

do you mind if i call you letitia ?

i start on monday .

no .

it does n't matter who .

i 've met someone else .

whoa . whoa . have really loved me ? letty , it 's natural to be nervous . but we 're going to work through our problems .

so , what do you say , let ?

it 's , it 's really nice , paul .

so , i 've been thinking a lot ...

yes , i suppose so .

i do n't think so .

i need someone to work on budget projections .

what does that mean ?

mrs. hallstrom , why do n't you join my family for dinner . you 'll love my grandma rosa .

i 'm going to retire with a shit-load of money . find me a small country that does n't have an extradition treaty with the states and live the good life .

you want the tapes for yourself . you 're going to sell them .

a pass ? how you gon na give me a pass ? a witness can put me at the crime scene .

i can get them -- but what do i get if i do ?

agent hadley .

i thought you wanted zammito ?

listen , we know their names . they do n't know the city . you 'll find them . you 're the fbi .

you 're calling me on is phone ?

you 're calling me on your cell phone , right ?

yes . we went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some mafia guy .

hello ?

i do n't trust anyone . you do n't get to the top of this game by trusting people ... and after all , you are a thief . it 's in your nature to steal . i 'm just protecting my investment .

you told me that on the phone . what the hell are you doing here ? showing off your communication skills ? go back to your people and tell them when they 're serious to put a number on the table .

yeah . that warehouse over on merchant street . the volume on our import business has risen dramatically . the proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --

you sure ? i just got a shipment of espresso from sicily . special blend . ca n't find anything like it in the states .

good . i 'm good .

they knew who you were when they broke in your house ?

he missed three weeks .

this plane will take you to canada . from there you can fly back to paris .

i assume you want something ?

i do n't know .

i know they wo n't be home tonight .

why do i always have to answer the phone ?

yeah . we just go home .

what about the money ?

no one ? then why is zero here ?

i bought everything you put on the list . gloves . pen knives . flashlight . batteries were not on the list .

do i ?

all you are is a professional ass-kisser .

no . chicks dig me .

i would have to say ... pretty fuckin ' bad . you gave us the wrong address sophie .

good idea .

after the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window .

there 's just one more thing i need you to do .

a thousand dollars ?

i 'm from belgium .

-- you stole my cousin enrique 's car .

if i knew where they were you would n't have to find them , would you ?

what hotel ?

i was told to take what we have and go .

yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right .

yes .

okay . i will have a beer .

this kind .

when we get to the next corner jump out .

i 'll drive .

pink panther , black panther . who gives a shit ? and i do n't remember asking you a god damn thing , you little turd .

a black panther was a member of an african american militant group in the sixties , marcel . i think you 're referring to the pink panther .

no !

hey , you know you ca n't this in france .

why would they want us to rob the mafia ?

-- i want to be elvis .

normally i 'd be breaking your fingers right now , but i 'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself . we have a group going to chicago to do a job . you 're going with them .

it 's yours . a gift . a gift you could give to your brother ... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment .

i represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous , but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother .

uh huh .

you 're not helping .

wait here .

i think we went the wrong way .

they killed our friend . it 's personal now . besides , if we do that , then julien died for nothing . the tapes are the key .

i ca n't even hear myself think .

i 'm sorry things went so wrong today .

they 're not nice people .

what 's this ?

that 's why we 're only breaking one arm .

i did n't have the heart .

this jade fox is a woman ?

wait ! i 'm a friend !

that 's a risk i 'm willing to take . deep down , you 're good . even jade fox could n't corrupt you .

my name is li mu bai . the green destiny is mine . jade fox ca n't be your master . where did you learn that `` xuan piu '' move ?

believe me , i 've a lesson or two left to teach you !

master ... i started learning from you in secret when i was 10. you enchanted me with the world of giang hu . but once i realized i could surpass you , i became so frightened ! everything fell apart . i had no one to guide me , no one to learn from .

yes , you do ! you are still my disciple .

why are you still here ? you killed a policeman . you should leave ! you 'll bring ruin on my whole family .

you 're home late ... or should i say early ?

without the green destiny , you are nothing .

i was just passing by and wondered how you were .

no , really ?

no ! you could n't roam around freely if you were .

i 've read all about people like you . roaming wild , beating up anyone who gets in your way !

my friend li mu bai . he 's given it to sir te as a gift .

exquisite ! you said it belongs to ...

go .

so you 're still that little boy looking for shooting stars .

give it back .

well , there used to be ! what 's your name ? i 'm lo . the hans call me dark cloud . i 'm not that tall or big , but i 'm quick as lightning .

lo ?

mu bai , hold on . give me some hope ...

that ca n't be ! everything has an antithesis ! why not this ?

we 're close to your headquarters . go home and check in .

giang hu is a world of tigers and dragons , full of corruption ... i tried sincerely to give it up but i have brought us only trouble .

she 's out there , but i doubt she 'll show herself . we 'll keep our eyes open . sooner or later , she 'll come for the girl .

sir te believes it 's a ploy cast suspicion on governor yu .

i am . he has always been our greatest protector .

the green destiny sword ? you 're giving it to sir te ?

perhaps i could ask you to deliver something to sir te for me .

yes .

monk zheng said you were at wudan mountain . he said you were practicing deep meditation .

no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking .

then someone 's trying to set him up . we should inform li mu bai .

and you 're gon na tell me who .

was . albrecht this is n't top dollar 's style anyway . this was somebody else . somebody new .

sure it coulda . funboy 's not here , neither is t-bird -- none of top dollar 's number ones .

this is special , darlin ' . please ?

whatever it is , the answer 's no , eddie . i 'm too busy tonight .

and i say i 'm dead ... and i move .

and she 'll be alive . up here .

i remember him ! here , gabriel ... here kitty ... gabriel ... is he still yours ?

a remembrance . a closure .

does she have a name ?

well , how 's your friend ?

right .

i know your friend , too -- the one that looks like a rock star .

holy shit ... you 're dead , man ...

do you know what you destroyed ?

i want the girl . unharmed . now .

does it hurt ? ! you dead-ass , clown-faced fuck , of course it fucking hurts ! what the shit are you gon na do about this ? !

neither .

your job is done . you interfere with the living again .

go away .

glad to see you 're finally with the program .

kill the men who killed you both , and the day of the dead will be your reunion .

having fun yet ? no ? i 'll give you a hint . remember whatshername ?

interested ? follow the crow .

18k . crap .

kill a dead guy ?

who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead . when he begins to care about the living , you 'll find his heart can bleed ... and i want it to bleed for me .

this is a cobra , mr. grange . yes , it is real .

did you see an animal of any kind ? did you see a bird ?

you did n't show it to anybody ?

you what ?

i have his journal .

are you okay ?

okay ...

no . i mean . i do n't know . what else do you know about him ?

babe , you 're looking at the next mother teresa .

yeah , it 's pretty relevant considering my situation .

without question .

do n't you believe in love at first sight ?

it was fine .

give it up .

what 's the big deal ? we 're friends . have n't you ever seen your friends naked before ?

that 's repulsive .

i 'm sorry , but you 're not my type .

do you deny that there 's an attraction between us ?

you implied it .

oh come on . quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool .

romantic ? he rapes her .

what'cha reading ?

why are you being so dramatic ?

are you often this offensive on a first encounter ?

alright , i believe you . stop crying . your secret 's safe with me .

i shit you not . mcconnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month . we 'd go at it for a while , then as soon as he 'd cum , he starts freaking out . you know - `` what are you doing , man ? i 'm not a fag . i 'll kick your ass if you say anything . '' it 's like , for christsakes greg , you 're gay , deal with it . the only reason why i let him continue with his charade is because he 's got a mouth like a hoover .

let 's just say greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field .

it would make sense . mcconnell hates me . i fingered his girlfriend at the game last year .

- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me .

what are the boys like ?

cool .

so ? do n't you want to make ronald a happy pappy ? practice makes perfect , cecile . my advice is to sleep with as many people as possible .

if she knew , she 'd kill me . it happened at your house last night .

it 's kathryn .

maybe you should try it on your friend ronald sometime .

see that was n't so bad .

i was thanking her . vietnamese is such a beautiful language .

he 'll love it .

my father just took me on a trip to australia .

and you have n't made an ounce of progress .

honey , is something wrong ?

positive .

come on greg . you 're the only one who knows her . the truth will save you .

annette harrison ? i do n't know what you 're talking about .

he does n't scare me . i 'll kick his ass in .

ronald ?

i think you have your answer .

get out !

i have a flair for drama .

i knew this guy last summer in the hamptons . he and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other . but she had this huge weight problem . his friends taunted him mercilessly about it . you know , `` how do you breathe when she sits on your face ? '' `` it 's embarrassing for you to be seen with her . '' finally he could n't take it anymore and decided to dump her . she flipped and he went on the defensive . i distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again . `` i 'm completely fucked up . '' `` i 'm completely fucked up . '' `` i 'm completely fucked up . '' poor fatty never had a chance .

why so nervous ?

i ca n't believe you 're reacting this way . you 're just saying this because you lost the bet .

not anymore you do n't . it 's obvious .

it clearly is why .

it was ... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part .

no , tell me .

so ? how 'd it go last night ?

shut up .

who are you spying on ?

you amaze me .

it just so happens we 're not in kansas anymore . our little angel 's father has accepted the new headmaster position at oakwood . she 's staying with my aunt up in connecticut while daddy sells his house . can you imagine what this would do for my reputation ? screwing the new headmaster 's virginal daughter before school starts ? it will be my greatest victory .

oh yes . i 've read it over and over again . this baby 's the real deal . daddy 's little angel . a paradigm of chastity and virtue .

i need you to seduce our young cecile . introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery .

cecile 's attending oakwood in the fall .

do n't worry , it 's totally understandable . most of the boys that matriculate at oakwood are very upstanding gentleman , however there are the occasional bad apples .

you 're too kind .

i guess that puts me in my place . thank you for the hospitality mrs. caldwell . it was a true awakening .

oh do n't give me any of that racist crap . my husband and i gave money to colin powell .

yep . then i fucked your daughter .

ronald , i 'm sorry .

what are you talking about ?

how ?

what do you mean ?

i 'd love to .

look ! why do n't you run out and play ? the sun 's shining .

irena .

sh ! then you must keep it true . goodnight , darling .

i really do n't know , but i do know that you must return the ring . you get edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady .

do you know the people ?

that 's what i wished on . edward says it 's a wishing ring -- and it is !

the song i was trying to hum . the song my friend , taught me .

i can make wishes like this come true . i 'll be just like daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself tell the truth --

i suppose so .

well , you know where it is .

i forgot i had it on .

no . it 's not that . it 's because i know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things . i love amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals . i saw what happened to irena with her cat people .

she said something about that , mrs. reed but she did n't tell me it was the farren house . i 'll get my other hat and coat and go over there .

but there 's no one here , darling .

amy , answer me . why did you call her your friend ?

this one says , `` to mother from amy . ''

these are all from me .

it was on account of the birthday party .

but this is different . go on blow ,

yes , daddy .

may i pet the deer ?

it stands so still .

my dolls . we can pretend .

no , i do n't think that 's very much fun . let 's play house instead . you be the friend who comes to see me . i 'll show you my children .

that 's right !

it got hit .

you 're going to be busy all day long , edward .

well , if it 's a real mourning ring , . i 'm going to think hard for something i want more than anything else in the world before i wish .

they 're given to the living in memory of the dead . if this is a real one -- i ca n't be sure -- you can make a wish , and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye .

i would n't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring .

most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl .

one little piece of cake wo n't hurt you . go ahead , take one . it 's full of fruit ... citron , cherries and ginger . it 'll make you dream . yes , wonderful dreams .

my barbara was killed . i killed her . yes , it was my fault . everyone told me not to drive from the theatre . there was a raging wind that night , and snow and ice . all was well until we got to the sleepy hollow bridge . barbara was singing a little song and then ... i do n't know how it happened ..when i awakened , they told me the car was overturned , and they would n't let me see barbara . barbara was dead .

the storms have done everything they can to me , i do n't hate them . i do n't even hear the wind . it blows beyond me . it was on such a night as this that barbara died .

i hate the storm . i hate it !

it 's dark . we 'd better be getting on . the family will be waiting .

come away , amy .

let the child stay .

something to do with a butterfly -- they were quarreling about it .

i 've been working out .

sorry i did n't recognize you earlier . you look so different .

yeah that 's like a three bagger . today a bag is also a condom , so now a three bagger can be a chick that 's really hot . so hot you got ta put several condoms on to dull the senses .

that bite healed up quickly . it 's been about three weeks ?

pms . what symptoms are you experiencing ?

good . except for pms .

it 's okay if you are , we just want to know . i do n't want to be expecting grandchildren if ...

jennifer ?

i think george knows .

guess she never found true love .

probably for three weeks or so anyway . i 'm not sure -- i do n't get how it works .

you 're cheating on george ? jennifer , how could you ?

what happened to his tooth ?

oh my god jennifer . i should go to confession .

i put it down the garbage disposal .

frida , you 're not making sense . i ca n't come over right now .

no ! not fucked him , i think i killed him .

jennifer . a severed arm . it 's bloody and ... i 'm not sure but it may be carlton 's .

i look like fuckin ' chewbacca .

what did he say ?

we almost slept together ... and ... then the hair started and i booked .

give him the tampon test .

i 'm sorry . i did n't want you to think i was still a doormat .

my vision got worse again .

and then ?

no , did you fuck him ?

they better . of course , trouble is , you never know what they 'll expect for it . you got ta know what to order , and what you 're willing to do . like if a guy spends a fortune on you , he 's gon na feel like you owe him something .

why did gregory ask me out ? i mean he 's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea .

i kind of asked him to . we were , you know ... he got a little carried away ...

do you really need these ?

how about i give you a make-over ? you 'll feel better about yourself . you 're actually pretty , you 're just not bringing it out .

my date always pays more attention to you than to me .

every woman at some point has to date a musician . i wish you 'd get rid of mark for good . every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out .

come on , we 've been double dating since the fourth grade .

uh huh . so pee .

what ?

they say sex is great for cramps .

well , whattdaya think ?

ouch that stings ! damn , what am i going to do with my back like this ?

no .

uh ... yes . not for us . no woman in jeopardy . find me dr. quinn medicine woman . find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women .

no . it does n't work that way . men ca n't get pms . unfortunately .

i do n't think you would . no matter what form you take .

yes , sort of . i mean no , not really .

what ? is there someone else ?

you know , i 've never seen your cat .

still have n't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off . never seen anything like it .

uh ... the buzzer 's broken . i 'll be down in a second .

frida , can we come in ? we need to talk to you . it 's important .

uh ... . hi !

no . i was doing my laundry .

what 's wrong ?

no ... no ... this is embarrassing . i was returning your pillowcase ... and i saw you cross the street ... and i sort of started following you . i just find you really intriguing . i do n't know why .

you say you killed a man and do n't remember it . could n't you have had sex and not remember it ? it 's sexual . why did you choose `` eating him '' as the method of killing ?

we did n't have sex .

packages of money .

no , take it .

no , it was our first date .

did he come home with you ? did you go to his apartment ?

you ca n't believe this bullshit .

you have some weird friends . what does her thinking she 's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat ?

i 'm supposed to put up with a fuckin ' cat i 'm allergic to cause your friend 's got pms ?

i wonder how frida and carlton are getting along ?

she 'll talk about pms and stare at her salad .

she 's just so ... pathetic .

my girlfriend 's predicting another murder in the next few days .

what are you talking about ?

you take the cake lloyd . come on , she 's not here . let 's check out her psycho ex .

this is more than fishy , this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead .

i told you she was innocent .

i can tell she 's not a killer . you just do n't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation .

no man . blood is not a turn on . you sure let that frida off the hook . you were n't even going to take the sheets . if i did n't know better , i 'd think you liked her .

they do n't speak english ...

spinning backwards ?

i do n't know what you 're talking about .

how could you have been so stupid ?

yes , sir . i 'm sorry ... but i do n't understand how it was possible . the only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall , he was cuffed ...

i see . one things for sure , hes ambitious . youll be a busy man from now on .

put it through ...

fine .

you wont regret this , sir .

do n't know that either .

where are we going ?

what is going on ?

no . have a look .

such a joker ! like your father .

shut up , freak ! monster ! you are insignificant .

no it is n't . < u > you < /u > are doing it ! now raise it over the glass and ...

i 'm nothing then .

i can not say ... you do n't know the answer to that ?

well ...

known me for long ?

water ?

of course you are . you could n't do those terrible things . come home with me - maybe things will make sense then ...

what the hell is this ?

be a professional . if you can convince her - - you can convince anybody .

it 's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung ... hands to the side ...

i 'm not certain about ...

a month .

what 's with her ?

now , remember -- keep it simple .

we 'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything , duane will be right outside the door .

do n't worry . you wo n't even see her .

the usual ...

yeah ... you just want me to wave , right ?

... but as i began to investigate , i realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher ...

just what you think i mean .

i do n't think so .

do we have anything on the budget today ?

you 're kidding .

uh , let me get back to you ...

if we find nothing , we get creative . just make something up . instead of a couple weeks it 'll be a couple of months . the whole thing is under control .

check his kids .

what about the wife ?

what about her .

is that everybody ?

i was a senator , you know .

do you know how many different kinds of laws we 've broken ?

we think so .

like how ?

tilt we figure something out .

thanks . you did great . maybe later you could come back and we could go to camp david or something .

so what do we do ?

i got ta tell ya , dave . i 've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just does n't add up . who does these books ?

why would they do that . they hired me .

oh yeah ... me , too . you want to get dinner later ?

so you want to go swimming ?

dave , the budget 's a very complicated thing . even i do n't understand it sometimes . now occasionally we have to make some cuts and ...

what ?

why ?

and it 's proving quite effective ...

yes , mr. president ?

yeah .

fertility beads .

who ?

well , is that really true ? i mean , would you really get killed just to save his life .

of course .

so you just protect the president the whole time ? that 's your whole job ?

really ?

you 're not ?

i never thought i 'd ...

i saw you on t.v ... at his funeral .

yeah . and it 's better than not believing it their faces are inches apart .

they 're crucifying you out there .

i run a temp agency .

you mean when i 'm not running the country ?

i 'm starving . there 's got to be something open around here .

i never wanted to hurt anybody . in fact ... i even thought i was helping .

i mean , what is it ? another secretary ? a jaunt to the bahamas with some 'campaign worker . ' where is he ?

what 's wrong with a magic trick ?

i care about the homeless .

it 'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech .

we 're doing our best , sir .

the mainland ... is dead ... a dead place ... nobody there ...

let 's just ... .wait a minute . get a better look .

i dunno . landing pad for a helicopter ? i dunno .

quiet !

listen , missy . i am the only due process that has ta be served aroun ' tyere and one of the people doin ' the servin ' from now on is gon na be you . now you been prancin ' aroun ' the cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough ! all that 's

it 's ... he was ... one who came to the island with me .

there 's hundreds of 'em . right where we landed our boat .

you think you can find your boat ? there 's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here . you remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now ? you leave yourself a trail ?

that 's why we did n't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed . we ready to fight when we have to . and we got ta fight now .

it 's a disease . it 's a ... a bug ... a parasite that infects the brain .

gasparilla ?

we 're gon na blow up the powder magazine .

nooooooooo !

aaaaaaah ... my god ... my god ... i am heartily sorry ... for having offended thee ... .offended thee ...

and you 're the one who builds the bomb and they says , ' i hope it 'll never actually be used ' .

you ca n't run away from the planet , miss science . you ca n't even run away from the island , heh heh .

god ... .damn you , rhodes !

mary !

i want you to leave . then maybe ...

so do n't goddam come ! please .

what is the point ?

well hell no , charlie , but that 's not the point . that 's not the point at all !

so you really think she means you 're going with her ?

so ?

the millions are awake enough for physical labor ; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion , only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life . to be awake is to be alive .

all right . i 'll try anything once .

how about a trig study group ? right after dinner .

oh come on , cameron , do n't you get anything ?

he flatters me so i 'll help him with latin .

it should , but i found it and now i claim it . carpe cavern , guys . seize the cave .

i 'm sorry . i , we

chet ? to a play ? are you kidding ?

huh ?

so , uh , where are you in school ?

mr. overstreet , i suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits . do you understand ?

we thought it would be good to break old habits , sir .

what was going on in the courtyard the other day ?

do n't stop !

a sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain .

good god , boy ! yell !

a barbaric yawp .

is n't there an easier way ?

eighteen ! that 's two years ! what about the play ? the performance is tomorrow night !

i know what he 'll say . he 'll say that acting is just a whim and that it 's frivolous and that i should forget about it . he 'll tell me how they 're counting on me and to put it out of my mind `` for my own good . ''

maybe they do n't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching .

she wo n't even see me , pitts .

i ca n't just forget her , pitts . and i certainly ca n't think about math !

it 's not too bad . it 's a tragedy ! why does she have to be in love with a jerk ? !

all right . jesus , what are you gon na do ?

wait a minute . i do n't let my parents walk on me .

if you have built castles in the air , your work need not be lost . that is where they should be . now put foundations under them .

then you can help him .

nobody- i thought i 'd surprise you . i 've got all as and-

do n't you dare talk back to me ! it 's bad enough that you 've wasted your time with this absurd acting business . but you deliberately deceived me ! who put this in your head ? how did you expect to get away with it ? answer me !

father !

weird .

i do n't know .

no thanks .

oh..

neil , you 're not gon na ...

being in the club means being stirred up by things . you look about as stirred up as a cesspool .

god , you really have a problem , do n't you ? how can it hurt you to read ? i mean is n't that what this is all about ? expressing yourself ?

why do n't you want a message sent ?

and what ? these things are octopusses ?

us ... i 'm talking about us ... we 're the fish .

then you better start swimming .

no , it just struck me as odd ... i do n't see you for all these years and you 've still got the same tape stuck in the box .

i do n't mean to drop in unannounced ... you ready ...

jet ski ... there 's one left up there .

if you blow up your boat , how are we going to get to the island ?

yeah ...

you 're saying they can think ?

the `` come back '' kind .

boat or no boat ... you woulda come back anyway . you 're that kind of gal .

on the side ! !

self sufficient ...

but what makes you think there are n't more of those ... things ... back there ?

... there 's got to be a way to access out back there ...

i do n't know ...

why do n't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here ?

was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to ...

i think we got ta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next ...

a little to the left ...

how 're you guys ... i mean , how 've you guys been ?

yeah ?

i can smell it .

no chance . not their sector . they ai n't even into things this big . our zone-boy 's performing out of a horror show . something else . unit nine found a couple cold ones in hollywood . one manny turner . gun runner . sounds like a connection to me .

i think he wants more than your cookies .

michael called yesterday . he wants to take willy for the summer .

it was wade 's old partner ... gallagher . he was behind it all .

your mother .

i heard about today . good job . i 'm all for capital punishment . why do n't you go home and see your family ?

we have an antidote that 'll retard the aging process .

mug sheets .

i 'm going to bring this down hard . i 've got an a-1 badass killer loose , an election day after tomorrow , and i 'm risking everything on you . you 're going to bring him in . i do n't care how . if you do , you 'll get your freedom . an official pardon from me . a clean slate . a good job . a chance to get back with your family . if you do n't want to , i 'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast , you 'll forget you were ever defrosted .

shucks , and i got all dressed up .

telephone repairman .

what are you doing this for , sanchez ?

that 's just it . he never did time . seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another . judge threw out the cases each time . either he 's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends .

so , he 's got a thing for prison clothes .

you treat her nice .

get us some fuck ' n back-up now !

let 's roll . we got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to doucet . 0800 this morning .

you 're not pregnant , are you ?

you want to be a good detective ?

she 's pretty .

this is where i found doucet twenty years ago . thought maybe he 'd come back .

yeah . least i think so . twenty- six years this march .

you 're saying you were put away for a crime you did n't commit ?

can i ask you something ?

got it . ejection seat ?

give me a break , sanchez . it 's like riding a bike .

i drive .

are you a cop ?

jesus , sanchez ... what do you think you 're doin ' ? that 's flatfoot data . you 're not supposed to have access to that .

bye . thanks .

yes .

hi .

they are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain . welcome ! help yourselves to drinks ! glad you could come ! have a good time .

that 's my problem , belle .

you think you 're so smart , mrs. stone . you wanted to be near jabez . it looked like your big chance tonight , but you 're wrong , you ca n't win him back -- not that way .

lying to you -- why should i ?

no , daniel -- they are not race horses . they are good old friends of mine . i call 'em constitution and bill of rights , the most dependable pair for long journeys . i 've got one called missouri compromise , too , and then there 's a supreme court -- fine , dignified horse , though you do have to push him now and then .

guess there will , if it says so .

daniel give me that beanshooter !

i did not , grandma .

that 's just too bad --

granny , when do we move to the new house ?

oh -- you do n't have to go to miser stevens while i 'm around .

yes , but what does a farmer do if he do n't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks ?

i do n't know -- do n't seem much of an idea to me .

jabez -- will you join our grange now ?

do n't say that -- i know it is --

almost seven . no -- no , he 's not seven yet i am sure --

are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract ?

well , why should that worry you . a soul -- a soul is nothing . can you see it , smell it , touch it ? -- no ! -- think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing , against seven whole years of good luck ! you will have money and all that money can buy . upon my word , neighbor stone , if it were n't for my firm 's reputation for generous dealing --

what does it mean here -- about my soul ?

it 's mine ?

yes , of course , people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died , you know how these things happen .

i know -- that was mighty queer medford -- knew it the minute i tasted it . but it takes more than that to down daniel webster .

i see . and this is where he 'd like to collect , too .

eloquent speech , neighbor stone -- could n't have done better myself -- -- under the circumstances . thank you .

here 's a man who knows what 's good for dan ' l webster ! medford rum ! ah , a breath of the promised land ! to the champion of the iron horseshoe , jabez stone !

shake !

now look -- here 's a list of the people i invited -- they 're all the right kind of people -- or did i miss anybody ?

why of course --

well , jabez -- i 'm a little pressed for time . you wanted to discuss something -- some business --

selectman ? selectman of the village ? me ?

worst i had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold , i guess -- er -- do n't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house , do you , stone ?

shall we ?

what 's the matter with 'em ? why do n't they come ?

why do n't they come --

and i do n't want to have a washwoman for a wife .

no , no . i do n't want to be idle .

well -- that 's the last time -- we 'll have servants to do it .

oh -- jabez .

jabez --

worried !

mary -- how do you feel ?

do you think i 'm grudging it ?

all right -- only he need n't dirty my pants !

my son ... what 's the matter ?

fiddlesticks ! she do n't hear it . got better music to listen to than that . there -- that 's what i mean .

now that 's the way to talk , son ! i know you worked hard for that crop . but we 'll make out .

lan 's , i 'd think you was having the baby , to hear you .

well , thank the lord you can always depend on new england for weather . we 've got enough for the whole united states .

well -- that 's comforting ! supper .

you found it in the barn , hey ?

i dunno .

that 's right , ma -- we ai n't licked yet . a stone 's never licked till he 's dead -- that 's what dad used to say , did n't he , ma ?

hard luck -- like me .

belle , give the sheriff a cup of rum .

it 's all right , sheriff .

i said you should stop worrying because i 've made up my mind !

what mountain ?

yes , jabez -- do n't worry .

well , i guess we wo n't be going to church today .

coming , ma .

you throw mighty far , jabez -- almost into the pigsty .

of course not --

-- i 'm going to try , mr. webster .

i object .

there is n't enough medford rum in the whole of new hampshire to make me sleepy .

scratch will do for the evening . may i -- join you ?

my money ? why , mister stevens ? what a quaint idea . come over to the door . i want to speak to you privately . stop throwing away that money . we must n't let people see any softness in you , mister stevens ... . people take advantage of softness , you know . come out of there -- i 'll give you an extension if you 'll forget this stupid repentance idea .

argyle . i 'm your limo driver . hey , nice bag .

we must shut down the building . go wider -- !

if he 's not a terrorist , and he 's not a hostage ... he 's just not part of the equation .

i 'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first ... them ... or your husband . hi there .

ya know harry , i think this whole experience has soured me on women .

how could she miss this ? this whole salute to collins was her idea .

oh my god . can you believe your ears ?

that makes total sense . the treasure chest was in his office . which means principal collins is a pirate ! i 'm surprised captain rob never mentioned him .

hey , let 's go spy on them .

that must be her boyfriend 's car .

yeah , right . why do n't you show it to your `` girlfriend '' ?

did you hear what i said ? the treasure ! like on your map !

harry ! i found the treasure !

harry !

harry , this is my fantasy ! i suggest you leave - before i imagine something horrible .

do you want me to pet your head ?

i 'm sure you 're overreacting .

alright , if you really want to go down this road , well girl 's like chocolate .

i 'm kidding ! of course i 'll be your partner .

a. slushee . do n't tell me . abraham slushee . third president of the united states .

i learned it from listening to you ! i hate you !

you 're not my real dad .

lloyd , she 's my mom .

peg leg ?

i do n't think so . this guy drinks rum from a barrel , says `` yo ho ho '' has a peg leg ...

one day they 'll find a cure .

oh , of course .

wow .

who 's principal collins ?

you know harry , this is my favorite time of day .

well , besides cooties and other medical reasons , they 're not in the cool crowd . which i am , and you want to be . know what i mean ?

my mom says the treasure 's somewhere in the school .

cool .

i thought i told you to get lost .

well , what have we here ? it appears be a tape .

my parents are going to wonder where i am .

last year toby was in a.p . english . and lewis won the science fair . what are they doing in special needs ?

hey , turk rescued you from the nerd . you 're in !

so i 'm an `` arrrrrs-hole '' , eh captain rob ?

you really are a pirate .

i do n't know if you 'd call us `` friends '' ...

mrs. d ! i was hoping you 'd show up .

loser ... oh yeah he was a loser alright . a big loser .

i am strong !

yeah , i get it . do n't worry i studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you 'll be fine .

well there 's a reason why that mascot is n't a stallion anymore .

this band sounds terrible .

why do n't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow . i have to pay somebody a little visit .

it was jessica . that girl who tried to follow me on the field trip .

so what do you keep in there ?

to take a picture for superintendent zimmer ?

oh wow . look at you .

small potatoes . this one is big time . this is visionary . this idea is genius .

i understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits , doctor .

so you are dr. kynes , the imperial ecologist ?

i am your truthsayer , my lord ... he is here , my lord .

forced spice evolution of humans changes many things ... . i must sit close to him .

yes .

you must share with us . -- emperor the atreides house is building a secret army ! ... using a technique unknown to us ... a technique involving sound . the duke is becoming more popular in the landsraad ... he could threaten me ... . i have ordered house atreides to occupy arrakis to mine the spice ... thus replacing their enemies the harkonnens ... . house atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain . then , at an appointed time baron harkonnen will return to arrakis and launch a sneak attack on house atreides ... i have promised the baron five legions of my sardaukar terror troops .

oh yes ? -- navigator better than those on richesse.. you are transparent ... i see many things ... i see plans within plans .

gurney ... i see thufir hawat among the captives . let him stand free .

we 'd have joined each other in death . however , you did seem to finally get the `` mood '' .

i 'm sorry gurney .

shield practice ? gurney ... we had practice -- this morning ... .. i 'm not in the mood .

i know the bhotani jib and chakobsa , all the hunting languages .

... the night is a tunnel ... a hole into tomorrow ... if we 're to have a tomorrow ...

the south polar regions ... the forbidden area . we must make it to that rock ...

bless the maker and his water ... bless the coming and going of him . may his passage cleanse the world .

why do they come ?

i am a servant of the his majesty the emperor . i have served his majesty on arrakis long enough for my eyes to change .

not all of them ... i know which ones will .

are you suggesting a duke 's son is an animal ?

i hold at your neck the gom jabbar . do n't pull away or you 'll feel that poison . a duke 's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals .

we have our new army . dr. yueh , put the weirding module on him .

i 'd know the difference .

those sounds could be imitated .

i predict we 're lost .

ah , cheer up ! do n't lose heart over what happened tonight . i predict that your next project will be an outstanding success !

i 'm obsolete . i have nothing to live for . tonight , i should die . and you should come with me .

norma . she changed her mind . she does n't wan na marry me . can you put down the gun ?

what do you mean all of a sudden ? you 've been going with her six months .

no problema . you want a picture ?

mr. pekurny . i 'm sorry to bother you . my son would just love to have your autograph .

i need help . how many times if just one little thing that i needed would 've happened , it would 've changed everything . if i had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or ... the tumblers just never clicked for me .

who is it ?

ed ?

no . it 's going to be about a half-hour .

um ... they gave me a limo , uh ...

well , it was really nice meeting you and , uh ... i 'd better get a cab .

oh , yeah , i love those . yeah ... those are funny ...

by the x .

el/ella -

pierdes .

i know . i know its not by choice . i just mean , well , being the kind of person you are , it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to .

one night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline . eventually dave and i were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student , but like two adults .

fine . you know . we just went to crossroads .

yeah , uh , just a minute

everything 's fine . just , you know , school .

yeah ?

you 'll be fine .

i just have to get something . i 'll be right back .

so ... what do you have to tell me ?

three twenty-five .

no , i ... uh , did n't know that

after dave got fired , sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce .

just one more thing . so , mr. m. , uh , do you think tracy 's going to be okay ? i saw her face after the assembly , and i think she 's taking it pretty hard .

and on halloween we could have a haunted house . but a really good haunted house , not like those cheesy bad ones . you know , more like the radio station ones . this one would be really scary . and for homecoming -- well , you know how last year 's theme was -

why do n't you guys go sit down , okay ? i 'll catch up in a minute ? i want to talk to mr. m. about some important stuff .

huh ? oh . uh ... pears

i wanted to play next year so bad i could taste it . and maybe go on to ...

and 290 `` disregards , '' right ?

no way i it does n't make sense .

i do n't care .

i 'm not a dyke , okay , and we 're not in love . we were just ... i was just experimenting .

oh , no , hey . like i said . tammy would n't ... she ...

paul , i just want you to know that no matter how this turns out , you 've run a wonderful campaign . it 's been fun competing with you .

you just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president ?

yeah . oh , one more thing . tammy . you know , all this election stuff . 'cause , you know , everyone is saying it 's so weird that you 're running against me , and , well , it is kind of weird , and you have n't really told me why you 're doing it and did n't tell me in advance or anything . but that 's okay , you know . l respect your privacy . i just want you to know that no matter who wins , if it 's you or me , there 's no hard feelings . we 're still brother and sister . okay ? cause ... and i hope you feel the same .

that 's right . our motives are selfish , so we 're cooperating .

you use words like that , you might make me mad .

your partner 's through . department scapegoat on the chief 's orders . he 's been billed , he 'll be indicted and he 'll swing .

captain , what do you want ?

that 's him . that 's him .

first i want to go on record as saying that my susie was a virgin when she died .

patchett 's dead . he sent you after me . i 'd say dudley 's tying up his loose ends .

it 's a suicide note . says he killed jack because jack had figured out a pornography scam patchett was running .

you expecting problems ?

let 's go see pierce patchett . run a good-cop-bad-cop .

dudley .

the nite owl ! stensland was going there to sell the heroin .

< u > stensland and buzz meeks < /u > . two-man triggers knocking off mickey cohen lieutenants . when they killed deuce perkins , they got heroin as a bonus .

i knew stensland and meeks knew each other . meeks was with sue lefferts on christmas eve . the night i met lynn . lefferts ' mother i.d.ed stensland as lefferts ' boyfriend , but stens pretended he did n't know either one of them .

why ?

hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence .

yeah , that 's stens .

then listen closely , because i 'll only say this once and if it gets repeated , i 'll deny it . i run call girls . lynn bracken is one of them and so was susan lefferts . i treat my girls very well . i have grown daughters , myself , and i do n't like the thought of women being hurt . i sense you share this feeling .

then you would n't feel obligated to report them ?

against your code ?

you know i do or you would n't be here . how did you find me ?

i do n't know him . mr ...

i am . are you soliciting for police charities ? the last time , you people called at my office .

i 'm not asking you .

should i ?

just show me where they are !

where do they get their stuff ? come on . give me one to feed the d.a . just a little one .

dogs got no reason to live .

you look like robinson after that last lamotta fight . 'course lamotta looked a lot worse . so you 're twenty-two , right ?

what do you mean deuce perkins got clipped last night ? !

something 's wrong . i feel it inside . does n't that sound crazy ?

she may still be alive , whoever she is .

i 'll break them , sir .

so be it .

at least get rid of the glasses . i ca n't think of one bureau man who wears them .

you 're narco , lad , not homicide . and since when do you work with edmund ?

you think golden boy can handle it , cap ?

what are you going to do ?

what ?

yeah . my whole life .

damnit ... < u > what < /u > ?

with tinsel and plastic icicles and ... on his penis , sir .

i 'll tell you what i told officer white when he asked me about susan 's death .

i work for patchett . i had a feeling that there was someone else , but i never knew who .

you , me and white , huh ?

some reality .

you sound like you mean it .

i 'm curious about you .

none . call it a hunch .

all he found were rodents . no signs of foul play . so there .

it seems like my susan , but ...

jackie ! you got some good scoop for the sidster ?

sure , he just tried to throw me off the force last christmas as a little joke .

i like it ! i like it !

stand there with your camera . i 'll stop here so you get grauman 's chinese in the backgrouns .

karen , this is sid hudgeons from < u > hush-hush < /u > magazine .

a bootleg ...

showbiz .

i 'm pretty sure i can get you a part on the show ... but tonight ? pretend it 's an acting job , kid . showbiz .

pierce is n't like regular people . i dig him , but he scares me too .

something like that .

< u > they < /u > said he was behind an extortion scheme .

it 's actually dh-1 digitech pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator .

be careful , danny .

i 'm doing a transfer now .

do it !

alright , i made a joke about squirrels , do n't get so --

goddammit , shut the fuck up and turn on cnn !

yes .

really ?

considering the enormous exposure to which you 've subjected this firm , i 'd think you 'd do best to simply answer my questions .

why do n't you just call brill directly .

c'mon .

listen --

what if we transmitted it over cellular ?

< u > i < /u > know . < u > i < /u > know what they 're looking for and i 'm telling you .

same thing ?

what about newspapers and magazines ?

we 're honest people and we need your help . i 'll give you two- hundred dollars if you --

these guys are incredibly persistent .

let 's not do the tire thing anymore , okay ?

here ?

where ?

that is one ugly sunrise .

welcome to santa 's workshop .

jesus .

i did n't use my name .

look , my wife is understandably --

did you call anyone ?

i taped it off the 11 o'clock news .

get dressed . we 're leaving .

what if --

wait . what do i do ?

230 giga-hertz . they use that band for the aquacade spy-sat uplinks .

what < u > is < /u > that ?

i clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away .

wait .

anytime .

law enforcement ?

well , sir , i 'm afraid it 's not as simple as that . your average newspaper guy or hard copy lady or whatever , they ca n't buy this stuff .

you 're a tough nut to crack , dylan .

hello . hello , maria .

remain calm .

eight . size eight .

a police report .

a report ?

your stuff ?

... who root through ... uh ... presents , and ...

i was missing you .

good .

i was in a car chase and a small explosion . now listen to me : the nsa is behind this . they think that guy i told you about , daniel zavitz , they think zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them . so they 're doing all these things < u > electronically < /u > . the bank records , the surveillance . they 're the ones who broke into the house . now i know there 's no reason to believe me . but i love you . and i love our son . so just believe me anyway . please .

no , i was with her yesterday . i want you to take eric and go to our parents house . i want you to do it right now .

i think you should leave now , robert .

it 's not a real picture , stacy , it 's been doctored-up .

i did n't want you to be upset . i should n't have lied . stacy , there 's nothing between me and rachel banks .

you told me you were n't seeing her at < u > all < /u > .

i see her for business .

what do you mean ?

a toaster . and no terrorist talk at dinner . you 're spookin ' the kids .

i saw a man die .

bobby !

uh-oh .

i want to talk to a goddam lawyer .

you 're right , mr. depinto , and maybe i jumped the gun .

this is fucked . you do n't know < u > who 's < /u > in that --

why the hell would i --

what can i do for you ?

you did n't squeeze depinto ?

any idea what he looks like ?

i 'm sorry about that .

how ?

that 's temporary .

eat your fish .

he did n't < u > give < /u > me --

we 'd rather not --

otherwise you may have to what ?

we 'd like to recover any materials mr. zavitz may have given you --

maybe bellmoth . maybe the unions . i do n't know .

it 's okay to use the phone .

are you and mom getting a divorce ?

having an adventure . i ca n't tell you about it right now , but i 'll tell you about it soon .

she 's in the kitchen .

are those my christmas presents ?

no . no , it 's okay .

i wo n't < u > make < /u > it to the police . they wo n't let me get there . you go .

i do n't know !

why would the nsa --

they 're framing me .

jesus .

just be cool .

he 's heard that it 's escalated .

the congressman 's very happy to have your support , but he 's heard that there 's an investigation .

what ?

yeah , what 's going on ?

i do n't know .

then what 's your goddam opinion ?

what 's your opinion ?

i said fuck you .

it means who 's side are you on ?

he walked right up to me in church . at the holiest time of the wear . he approached me in a sanctified place . kill him now .

three minutes . we 're going in light . myself and two others . everyone else is held back in reserve .

not yet . he 's near `` m '' and 34th . i 've got an elsur unit on the scene now . a residential building . twelve units .

i do n't care if he 's solomon with saint joseph sitting in his < u > lap < /u > . i want the tape and i want him . now is --

he 's arrogant and threatening . voice stress points suggest he 's worrying .

no thank you .

our garden , our garden - not so much the garden , but the copse alongside it , wild , a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and france . the devil 's chimney it was called - the devil 's chimney , i do n't know why . darling . my darling .

listen to me , katharine . you 've broken your ankle and i 'm going to have to try and bind it . i think your wrist might be broken , too - and some ribs , which is why it 's hurting you to breathe . i 'm going to have to walk to el taj . given all the traffic in the desert these days i should bump into one army or another before i reach there - or fenelon-barnes and his camel . and then i 'll be back and we 'll be fine , and i 'll never leave you .

you speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk .

please do n't move me . it hurts too much .

it 's beautiful . what 's it about ?

no , no , it 's hungarian . my daijka sang it to me .

ownership . being owned . when you leave , you should forget me .

water ? yes , we have water , we have a little in our can , we have water in the radiator which can be drunk . not at all cowardly , extremely practical . come on , come on ! there 's also a plant - i 've never seen it but i 'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid .

- there is the harmattan , a red wind . which mariners called the sea of darkness . red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of england , producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood . almasy checks to see if katharine is still awake .

be careful ? you mean you - or me ? who ?

daskylus

is n't zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms ?

appropriate ?

may god make safety your companion .

i told you so .

bermann thinks he 'll be interned , poor fellow . i 'm going to do what i can , but and d'ag turns out to be a great admirer of mussolini . so now you can say i told you so .

in my room .

which we 've overflown twice .

you should n't go into another man 's tent . it 's inexcusable .

what if i told you he did this to me ?

what do you do ? what are you doing here ?

because we 're fine here . i do n't know what mary told you about me , but i do n't need company , i do n't need to be looked at .

if you said yes i would have had a reason . you should let me redress those bandages . before you go .

and you thought you 'd come and settle the score ?

i see .

so , i come across the hospital convoy i was looking for this stuff , and some nurse , mary , hana 's friend , tells me about you and hana , hiding in a monastery , in purdah , whatever it is - retreat - how you 'd come in from the desert and you were burned and you did n't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession - - a copy of herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings , and then i knew it must be you .

is it you ? if i said moose i look different , fuck , why should n't you ?

why do i feel if i had your book i would know everything ?

i think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her .

hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -

you like him , do n't you ? your voice changes .

kip 's another one .

really ? that 's sudden .

please , do n't waste your time on pleasantries -

your friend ?

me ? he ca n't . i 'm already disturbed .

why ? can he lay eggs ?

oh - i 've found plums . we have plums in the orchard . we have an orchard ! she has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth .

i think they 're all in italian , but i 'll look , yes . what about your own book ?

because you 're leaning ? no , you 're just on an angle . you 're too heavy !

where 's your stuart from ? somewhere near there , is n't it ?

no !

i 'll always go back to that church .

i 'll always go back to that church . look at my painting .

but if it got late and i had n't shown up ?

i 'm not scared . so many people have died around me . but i would be a shame for us . i do n't feel like being shy .

yes , for your hair .

try this . i found a great jar of it . olive oil . in naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife .

he ca n't even move .

only we have to go to work .

we can do that when we 're very , very old .

a more modest expedition , or even wait a year . remind our families we still exist .

how awful . what will you do ?

i think i might go inside and sit down for a few minutes .

katharine !

hana , we have discovered a shared please - the boy and i .

or my wife 's .

you , want to blow the whole thing , go right ahead .

that 's doable .

entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm .

i do n't recall authorizing you to have a personal life .

i hardly knew the guy . why be impolite to strangers ?

my god --

come on .

we ca n't help it , we ... we 've got ta ...

brought us luck once , maybe it will again .

so what are you going to do with your share ?

done . and i assume you have the magic cd- rom ?

so how long till we do this ?

got it .

but those instructions , they 're recorded in the computer .

where the money is .

peoples china bank .

what about the rules ?

everyone has secrets , it 's what makes us human .

hmmm ... 44 long .

i like banks . that 's where the money is .

get the hell in .

duh .

are n't we all .

terrified . still am .

are n't we early ?

do n't get any ideas . of course it comes out of your share .

charged ?

yes you did .

hmmm .

we are ... for the tools .

precisely . you give me the mask security code , i steal the mask , you get a finders fee . at ten percent , should be two or three million at least . not too bad .

and good morning .

what 's your problem ? i 'm doing the job .

i 'm telling you it 's a forgery . the paint 's still wet for god 's sake .

quite a good one . a monet . not major , but it is giverney .

you want me to pick up a painting ?

and i thought we were getting on so well .

so what ?

excuse me ?

of course you would n't . the rembrandt would n't fit .

you disappeared .

i ca n't ?

we wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces , you know ? and they do n't come off . but when you find the one person who really knows you , and then you lose her ...

i figured that out .

you do n't really think i 'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag ? what matters is n't what 's real . it 's what we < u > think < /u > is real -- what matters is the art .

to yourself , that 's where .

you look like george washington .

anna ? with this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me , cause i 'm a little confused about how exactly we do that .

yeah . there 's two . why ?

any school you want .

a number for the whole group , or for us ?

you would n't happen to have a little time right now , would you , donna ?

well , they paid for the doctor 's visit .

yeah , i 'm real sorry to hear that .

cause first you got ta move , then there 's decorating , and if the windows are n't the same size , you know -- you 're making all new curtains . honest to god , i do n't know if i have the energy . you know , i 've been sick . me and peter both have .

i 'm erin brockovich , from masry & vititoe ?

but i know you 're not gon na quit on me .

this is n't doctor 's orders . it 's mine . i 'm saying you ca n't come .

tuesday at seven , at the hinkley firehouse .

< u > i know < /u > . we 're having a meeting , it 's all set up --

because . they know the evidence ; they know they 're gon na lose a jury trial . maybe they would n't lose 400 million bucks , but once you factor in all they 'd spend on this case in the next ten years , it makes a lot of --

if you 're here to fire me , your timing 's lousy .

gee , i wonder why .

do n't joke . they might . so do me a favor and behave yourself for once . ed masry to see kurt potter .

do you think we 'd do better by going to trial ?

he 's gone . did you get a license plate ? or a make ?

some guy in a truck -- he waited till i was alone , then he followed me , like , two miles . jesus , i 'm shaking . get me a beer .

hey . i like working with you .

you did n't care about my case ?

hey , i got a staff to pay , plus rent , plus i have n't billed a minute of my time since i started on this case , so you can quit hitting me up like i 'm rich or something .

i guess it was a little too inconvenient . so for fourteen years , this stuff flowed into the groundwater , free as you please .

they covered 'em over . and not too carefully either , cause you dig one inch under the surface , and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock .

yeah , yeah . remind me of that when i 'm filing for bankruptcy .

we can get these people . with a little effort , i really think we can nail their asses to the wall .

i know how dna works , erin --

it does n't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something 's wrong .

so what made you think it was ?

so what 's the story on this thing ? this cancer stuff ?

i left a message . i 've been dealing with that real estate thing . i was gon na write up a whole damn report and --

i told you the questions might get a little personal --

if you had n't used profanity --

... just wan na be a good mom , a nice person , a decent citizen . just wan na take good care of my kids . you know ?

corey .

i do n't know what you 're talking about .

i guess i did .

thank you very much . are n't you a gentleman ? mr. ...

yeah . a real moron .

hey , ros , where are they ?

what 's going on in there ?

i 'm a slow reader , on account of the fact that i look at the word `` dog '' and see `` god '' .

masry & vititoe , can i help you ?

oh , god , sweetheart , no . there 's nothing on earth i love more than you . nothing . i promise .

you always say that . then you go to work and forget you promised .

no offense . there are just some things we need that you probably did n't know to ask .

i will . bye .

hello ?

what 's going on ? what are you doing ?

that is not what i 'm --

yeah . we were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said , `` ball . ''

what ? beth ? my beth ?

you mind telling me what that 's supposed to mean ?

no , see -- that 's exactly what those arrogant pg & e fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power , we do n't stand a chance in hell against them . but you know what ? they 're wrong .

i 'm not gon na quit cause of one creepy phone call , george .

i 'm just saying --

well , hell , i guess that 's it , then , huh ? they 're scarred for life . they 're gon na start holding up 7-11 's any day now .

does n't matter . does n't make one bit of difference . oh god , george , how 'd this happen to me ? how 'd i end up so ... so < u > nothing < /u > ?

i < u > ca n't < /u > call an exterminator . i ca n't afford one . god , i ca n't even afford my < u > phone < /u > . i got fired .

fixing a leak under your sink .

i guess we get what we pay for , huh ?

cause i like kids . i like hanging out with them .

then lem me remind you , the polite thing is to say , thank you , that 's a real nice offer , i do n't mind taking you up on it .

i hope that 's not supposed to impress me .

why not ?

well , hello to you , darlin ' .

a lot . but you hang in there , maybe you 'll get one .

i 'm real sorry , laura .

i had photos of my kids , plus a mug --

someone stole my stuff .

yeah . who are you ?

no one put me up to anything . i was just hoping i could ask you a couple questions .

yes ?

dr. paulsen ?

yes , admiral ... . soon .

come in , admiral .

no ... there is another .

luke ... you are the only hope .

ben ... ben ...

you must survive , luke .

i ca n't ...

everyone 's invited , of course .

not now , chewie . lando , are n't you afraid the empire might discover this little operation and shut you down ?

oh , your father ... a powerful jedi was he , powerful jedi .

patience . it 's time to eat .

okay , artoo , let him have it . now get out of here , little fellow , we 've got things to do .

i have n't seen him . he probably came in through the south entrance .

he will join us or die , my master .

thank you , general . but there 's a price on my head . if i do n't pay off jabba the hutt , i 'm a walking dead man .

you 're an extraordinary fighter . i hate to lose you .

good , and commander skywalker ?

we 're in trouble !

... i love you . i could n't tell you before , but it 's true .

i 'm worried about all of us . i ca n't figure out what they 're up to .

i do n't like this .

a mining colony .

then we have to find a safe port around here . got any ideas ?

i 'm still not sure what you 've accomplished .

could n't be , i checked the transfer circuits , just like you said ! i tell you this time it 's not my fault . i 'm sure i checked it .

i see it chewie , hang on .

but the tremors have stopped .

do n't count on it . i happen to like nice men .

that 's quite a compliment .

yes , you do .

they 're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we 're safe .

what is it ?

that star destroyer is slowing down .

or you ran into something ... .

this baby 's got a few surprises left in her .

ooops ! i guess you have n't told luke about that yet .

those creatures he keeps talking about ... we 'd better double the security ... han , i do n't know how ...

spare me please ! do n't tell me about the rebellion again . i 've had it with your noble mission . all you let yourself think about is the rebellion . the result is you 're as cold as this planet .

he 'll know when he gets back ... do n't give me that look . every day more bounty hunters are searching for me . if i do n't pay off jabba soon , there 'll be too many to stop ... remotes , gank killers , and who knows what else . i 've got to get that price off my head while i still have a head .

you said you were going to stay . what happened ?

now do n't get the wrong idea , pal . she was just trying to express her true feelings for me .

yeah , you 're a real hero .

he does n't want you at all . he 's after someone named skywalker .

nothing . i never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer i knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... but you wear it well .

are you kidding ?

i forget nothing , calrissian . perhaps you think you 're being treated unfairly .

that was never mentioned . neither was this bounty hunter taking han . i hope you have n't forgotten our bargain .

the deflector shields are gone .

luke needs help . we must go back .

luke !

you 'd better know what you 're doing , or this is going to get very messy .

what 's going on ?

i did n't know you had a price on your head . vader has given you to the bounty hunter .

what about han ?

the speeders should be ready in the morning . they 'll make the search easier .

i understand .

a tremor !

leia !

han 's leaving ?

control , control you must learn of what you see . not easy , not fast .

my mind fills with so many images .

but tell me why ...

but i feel the force flowing !

i thought those seekers were set for stun !

size has no meaning . it matters not . look at me . judge me by my size do you ?

no ! no different ! the differences are in your mind . throw them out ! no longer of use are they to you .

anything on the millennium falcon ?

seventeen ships destroyed , we do n't know how many got away .

we know that .

yes , but do n't take any chances .

i like you .

somehow during the tour , she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device . we do n't know how .

nobody leaves cuervo jones . not unless you give your life . you fight till you 're dead . then i forgive you . understand ? understand ?

go on now . do as i say .

ooww !

you told me he was dead .

shit .

somebody get off !

get me to cuervo jones . get me to the kingdom . i got one hour .

do n't lie to me .

what 's the little black box do ?

how you doin ' plissken ? you like the watch ?

the prototype appears to be armed , mr. president . shall i begin evacuation ?

i give you my word . put the prototype into my hands , and you 're a free man .

right over there .

cuervo 's got a place near venice , where the big birds fly . nice digs , too . i 've been there , y'know .

you 're a star in your own right , you know that ? hey , i 'm map to the stars eddie . how you doin ' ?

good . i want you out . this is my sewer .

i just thought you wanted to get away . i did n't know you wanted to go someplace .

you need help .

well , i 'll think it over .

yeah .

in the name of god , of st. michael , and st. george , i make you a knight . rise , sir ...

my salvation is to die a knight of the round table .

arthur .

but one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the king 's law .

i do . rise , lancelot , come with me .

i , the best knight in the world , bested ! this is a great day , for my search is over . i love you , my king .

thanks to god , you are alive .

sir , your rage has unbalanced you . it seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy , for a length of road you can ride around .

not a boast , sir , but a curse . never have i met my match in joust or duel .

-- that is a wild boast . you lack a knight 's humility .

i know . i have heard noises and echoes through the stones ...

that is my destiny . i have a destiny , too ...

yes .

i had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so i could get some honey , and i did n't feel up to using any more magic just yet . anyway , i was in less danger than you 'll be in today .

well there . you do n't need me half as much as you think you do . you already know what must not happen .

rise , mordred .

we fought and won battles , and now one man defeats all my knights ? i will go .

i have kept it .

do n't start a war on my wedding day !

well , then , i shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters , so you can avoid their castles .

i am wasting away and i can not die . and i can not live .

the law forbids it .

and there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you ?

a lovestruck page !

to kill and be king , is that all ?

it 's not for you , uther , hearth and home , wife and child .

the oath . you did n't say --

hiding ?

that 's right mike . but he 's finished and came back around three ot four months ago , he 's in woodstock now .

we have to start looking for a shrink .

really ? wow .

oh , she 'd love it .

no thanks karl .

excuse me miss ?

no . it was n't me . i did n't .

karl if you put this in regan 's room i want you to tell me , now did you ?

she is going to be well ?

fine thank you .

are you planning to be home soon ? la , i mean .

are you sure ?

the shaking of the bed , that 's doubtless due to musuclar spasms .

wait a minute . what are you talking about ?

never .

ya know , those things to get attention , like saying that her bed shakes and stuff .

now this is for ritalin . ten miligrams a day .

there are no experts . you probably know as much about possession than most priests . look your daughter does n't say she 's a demon , she says she 's the devil himself and if you 've seen as many psychotics as i have , you 'd know it 's like saying you 're napoleon bonaparte . you ask me what i think is best for your daughter . six months , under observation in the best hospital you can find .

i thought you were supposed to be an expert .

like what ?

you 're a friend of father dyer , right ?

it 's the other way around . the society sent me through med school .

here i 'll show you .

yeah .

we 'll see regan . now about those party invitations ... ... .

we 'll see when we get home okay .

think it was a guilding . it was grey . oh it was so beautiful , the guy let me ride it all around .

what kind of stuff ?

um ... ... ..stuff .

okay .

hi chris . great party .

damien karras .

no .

how long are you planning to stay in regan ?

if that 's true , then you must know my mother 's maiden name . what is it ?

momma , i 'm all right , i 'm fine , really i am .

last month .

... and the power to confront this cruel demon .

hallowed be thy name . thy kingdom come , thy will be done , on earth as it is in heaven . give us this day , our daily bread , and forgive us our trespasses , as we forgive those who trespass against us . and lead us not into temptation .

the dominicans . go pick on them .

incidentally i mention only in passing that i could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession .

maybe somebody crazy , someone with a spite against the church , some unconscious rebellion , perhaps .

unlikely .

i 've seen him .

william f. kinderman . homicide .

... in the name of the lord jesus christ ! ! ! it is he who commands you ! he who flung you from the heights of heaven to the depths of hell !

yes i am her brother , he 's the son

we want to see mrs. karras .

right , twelve years . couple times a month .

no bones .

decay unfortunately does n't limit itself to the denture , mr. baker . it spreads into his chest . then the heart goes . we would n't want that , would we ?

five 's my guess . maybe more . wo n't know till i get in there . leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning .

beasley .

what 's wrong with the kid ?

in the attic . behind some of dad 's stuff . look , jack can hardly reach the pedals .

how 's the birthday girl ?

my pleasure .

what 's the gig ?

yeah .

no .

it was n't professional , jack . it was a stunt . a stupid-ass stunt .

look . i did n't know when we were going to be on until yesterday . what was i supposed to do ? i had the pianos anyway .

what 's it for ?

i told you , jack . it 's a telethon . no one gets a cent .

no .

cancel , frank .

you could 've come .

february ?

couple years .

the royal .

expensive hangover .

no , you 're wrong . it 's just beginning . come on , have a drink . show your big brother how it 's done .

we had a leak in the bathroom . he fixed it .

thinking there 's someone who looks like you , walking around the street somewhere . wonder if i saw him i 'd think it was you ?

what ?

really .

what ?

what matters to me is we 've got the six easiest nights we 've had in ten years . so 'tie a yellow ribbon ' sounds a little flat . so what ? nobody 's gon na hear it , jack . nobody . so why should you care ?

christ , ca n't you hear it ?

i think what mr. daniels is trying to say , jack , is --

why would i mind ?

we 're gon na be here a week ?

right .

a few bars !

frank asked if she 'd sit in for a song , she said yes , and we did a few bars .

come on , jack . it 's not like it 's the first time we 've bunked together . it 'll be like when we were kids . relax . enjoy the view .

when 's the last time we played a wedding , jack ?

you wan na get a drink ?

come on , stand still .

all right . what 's your name ?

it 's more like 40-60 , would n't you say ?

you ask me out here to sell me your house , frank ?

jack .

so talk to me tomorrow . after the gig .

what do you mean ?

christ , jack , it 's her birthday .

no thanks .

by the way , we got ta go see ma tomorrow .

really . you sleeping ?

you look awful .

what do you think ?

fuck him .

jack ...

your limo 's ready , ma .

really ? is n't that a coincidence .

and if she asks what it 's about , do n't tell her . she 's opposed to my career .

what do you mean ?

this where the auditions are ?

that song . i ca n't sing it anymore . i 'm gon na get sick .

forget it .

i just saw a man walk out of your room .

what do you say we send a bottle over ?

what 'd she sing ?

tell her .

smells like tuna number two to me .

smells like fish .

virgins .

sorry . it only plays static .

we do not take tips . i 'll apply this to the cost of the dress .

we need scissors over here ! who 's got scissors ? okay , remember . jack and i go on first , i do the set-up , then introduce you . and you say ...

they 're nines .

they 're tight .

what do you think ?

what 's wrong with it ?

what 's he talking about ?

so work with me , not against me . okay ?

what are we , an orchestra all of a sudden ?

when ?

uh ... you do n't know when you 'll be wanting us back , do you , lloyd ?

yes , sir . you 're just what we needed on a night like this .

brought it .

funny hours .

baker .

he does n't bite .

come on , ed .

barker . jock barker ?

no .

yes , well , it 's probably best . no sense bringing someone else in .

pretty much .

jack .

terrific . i 'm doing vegetables next week .

wow . but i still do n't see how ...

so , what happened ?

he had a mind that escalated things .

the both of them ? in there ?

my father proposed to my mother in there .

soap ?

must 've been a cheap date .

sure .

ed ? how many people live here ?

what 's that supposed to mean ?

nothing .

yeah , well , thanks for sticking your head in .

in and out .

how 's egghead ?

it 's the waves . god 's music , my mother used to say . she was crazy for the ocean .

are n't the kids asleep ?

no . thanks . she starts to move away , then stops and looks back .

like clockwork . you got a good memory , jackie .

sure .

can i stay here tonight ? even if she comes here ?

oh ?

he 's losing his teeth .

oh , fine .

he 's lying .

five . no one knows you 're his father . i thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you .

perfect fit .

yes . pollux bought one along with the original batch . obviously , he found a way to make more .

damn right .

would it ?

an nsa surgeon gave me castor 's face . he handled the transplant , the vocal implant , everything . but somehow castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission . but not before he was transformed into me .

who is this ?

so is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...

castor 's still alive -- technically . he 's a turnip , on total life-support ...

how is the `` date night '' idea going over with eve ?

give up , castor . people are going to find out .

what 's it to you ? i declare it . here i am , back in the states for less than a month --

or what ? you 'll have me fired ?

walton , you have to let me see the warden --

i 'm going to have you fired .

so 's a noose . now keep your mouth shut .

what 's the matter with your voice , commander ?

sfpd ? castor is n't stupid enough to come back to the city .

i mean like protection .

did it look like i was siding with him ? did it ? you want to play with the bad boys , you better be prepared . do you have protection ?

get a higher arc on the ball , jamie . and for chrissake , square your shoulders to the basket .

you 'll be seeing a lot of changes around here . daddy 's a new man .

screw your boundaries , janie . you have something i want .

the admiral ?

commander , what are you doing here ?

you picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off !

do n't worry , nobody knows i 'm inside . check it out . remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in thailand ? he 's being treated for bone cancer at the v.a . thanks to the miracle of nsa grid-technology ... -- ooops ! his radiation does just quadrupled .

i just heard about castor 's fratricide -- rather poetic , do n't you think ?

you 're the only person in this place who can see right through me .

great .

call me spontaneous .

so you see , i 'm not going anywhere . unless it 's upstairs with you ...

so -- how long will you be gone this time ?

stop jack , i 'm getting all weepy .

god , no . i thought about it for practically the entire flight ...

kate reynolds ...

oh , and oxxford called ...

its not good . bob thomas has secretly been talking to a european drug company . were not sure which one , julias on it right now . word is theyre willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company . the global people are up in arms . they say we shouldve been prepared for this . were in trouble here , jack ...

good for you . why shouldnt you protect whats yours .

what about me ?

im not trying to knock the tire business , jack .

mind if i ask what kind of sales you did last year ? ballpark ...

i was a sales associate , at e.f. hutton .

because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end ...

is that tonight ?

mommy needs five more minutes in la la land . that could be her present ...

rise ... and ... shine ... !

what are you doing ?

mary had a little lamb .

this isnt my real life . its just a glimpse ...

yes , thats it ... yes , we went to high school together .

wait a second ... jack ... jack ...

you see , its like were in each others heads ...

what am i saying ? you dont need to hear that ... all i meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie , thats all . is that you ?

maybe i dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me ...

great room ...

i mean it . from what i can tell , were a mom and pop operation , were already over-extended in sales , and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier ...

do i look like i live in a bottle ?

look jack , in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it ... let it come to you .

do i look like i need your money . it doesnt work like that and i cant tell you why .

figure it out . you got plenty of time .

what the hell is happening to me ? !

you know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him .

do you wan na die ? !

get out !

what ! ? look at the ticket ... !

well do whatever it is you do well , and just ... just do it . excuse me ...

mushroom puffs arent the only thing i do well ...

its lovely ...

frank . wheres alan mintz ? is he here yet ?

no , i didnt ... thats great .

sorry , pal . entrance is for residents and guests only ...

paris ?

no , this is the center of the universe . if i were living in roman times , i would live in rome , where else ? today , america is the roman empire and new york is rome itself . john lennon .

annie goes to a great school .

what are you sure about ?

your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks .

i never used to be like this , kate . i had it all figured out . no doubts , no regrets .

no . well , maybe a few things . but mostly just different ...

i used to be so sure about everything , you know ? i knew exactly who i was and what i wanted . then one morning i woke up and suddenly it was all different ...

are you sure ?

oh yeah , youre a bad girl , baby ... you make me so hot ... im gon na take you to that special place ...

thank you ...

surprise . were pregnant ... yeah ... that mustve been ... i mean that was very unexpected . but what are you gon na do , right ?

maybe youre not . the jack campbell i married wouldnt need a $ 2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life , but if thats what its gon na take , then buy it . just buy the goddamn suit ... we can take the money out of the kids college fund .

i wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva ... i drop the kids off , spend eight hours selling tires retail ... retail , kate .

i mean back in college , you were a very pretty girl , theres no question about that . but this ... ... youve really grown into a beautiful woman ...

i thought we had a deal about you watching cnbc in bed .

well thats just great ... those little monkeys can be a real handful ...

no , shes not .

here you go ...

christ ... where the hell is the bathroom ?

we 're being responsible . go . get on the plane .

i know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to london is the right thing to do . but in my heart ... this feels wrong .

not exactly . ive seen you on cnbc . you look taller in real life ...

i need you , tiger..

i just got a call from terry haight . bob thomas is nervous ...

okay , ill take them ...

tonight .

congratulations . the la guardia flights canceled but i got you out of kennedy on united at nine . am i good or what ?

hey , kind of under a little pressure here .

this ai n't permanent . my friend reed 's working on a cure ... i think .

i 'm not really dressed for a party .

how 'd you know it was me ?

not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --

ben , i 'm afraid i 've got to ask --

yeah . you do n't wan na know the details .

solid .

we got what we wanted . that 's < u > enough < /u > .

hey , i 'm mr. sensitivity now . clear the way , wide load coming through .

no more cracks about how i look .

go back to the drawing board .

i swear to you they 've done everything humanly possible . the best plastic surgeons in the world , ben . you had the best --

reed ? ... sue ?

let 's see : you got victor , stud of the year , more coin than god ? or reed , the world 's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp . hmmm , it 's a toss-up .

if you behave , maybe next time daddy 'll let you drive .

actually , the engines are smes . hydrogenbase , carbon propellant . couple generations past your last ride . i 'm not as dumb as you look .

just get back soon , or i start looking for a new groom .

he did n't mean it . you know johnny . he 's always been a hothead --

< u > what < /u > did he do to the uniform ? !

i can only stay for one drink , ben . i 've got to meet with victor .

< u > now < /u > .

johnny , slow down . < u > think < /u > . you know mom did n't raise us to --

johnny ? did you see ben ?

blockhead started it !

leonard , how 's the feed ?

showtime .

and if he 's not ... ?

not much . we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage .

sure .

of course i was . i 'd read all your papers on bioethics . some of them two times just so i 'd have something to say to you .

which is why i 'm working < u > twenty < /u > hours a day , checking every variable --

he was going to take away all my data , equipment --

no . there were n't . there was < u > you < /u > . and < u > me < /u > . no variables , no math . it was actually the simplest thing in the world . but your head got in the way ... like it always does .

no , i distinctly remember : < u > you < /u > walked out < u > my < /u > door . ergo ...

anger . rage . frustration .

excuse me ?

if it happened to him , then it could ...

we need to get past them .

material made from self-regulating unstable molecules . i 've been working on a formula for this .

never better .

oh , i think you already have .

please , no apologies . i 've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos . you 'll have round-the clock care .

just < u > find < /u > him .

victor , i 'm sorry i --

uh , victor , i hope i have n't done something to make you think ...

right , of course , the company ... but you see , i 've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --

it 's just business .

i 'd hold that off awhile .

i told you to cut down on the sugar .

message to proteus .

< cardiac red alert > we 're stopping the heart .

at topspeed ... and adjusting distance for degree of miniaturization -- the sub should get through the heart in fifty-seven seconds .

we still have fifty-one minutes . leave them in .

grant , our miniaturizer can shrink anything .

that 's right . he wanted us to have the secret , and not them . which is why they tried to kill him .

say that again ?

that 's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty .

we 'll know -- in the next breath ...

cora , is something wrong with the laser ?

keeping an eye on dr. duval ...

that 's what they pay me for .

i have no idea .

and if it should take more time to get through --

i never ... never imagined it could be anything ... like this .

i understand you 've been dr. duval 's assistant for quite some time ... he must 've snatched you out of the cradle .

that 's the trouble . i am . being shrunk ...

i think it 's the most exciting -- we 're going to see things no one ever saw before . the actual physical process of life itself -- not something under a microscope ... just think of it --

i 'm going to do what i can to save benes .

nothing miraculous about it . just an interchange of gases . the end product of five hundred million years of evolution .

not in a sealed vessel like an artery . captain -- something must be wrong with your controls !

it 's too late now . we must go on .

then why not take it ?

do n't tell me they 're refueling ...

i do n't believe that .

sorry , but the situation has changed .

the lymphatic system drains off excess fluid from the tissues . without it , we 'd all swell up like balloons . he reaches the console , begins to take out a new chart .

looks like the sea , at dawn .

yes -- with all that pressure , and suction within --

well , we better get on with it .

we feel great , do n't we ? just < great > ? !

we can get out through the lab section .

come on -- it 's no use !

they ca n't reduce nuclear fuel . but once the reactor 's miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it .

what 's wrong , skipper ?

thirty-two minutes left ... but chances are we wo n't have to wait that long for try-number three .

we split that .

i need ... unguent .

yeah , yeah , jesus - i 'm sayin ' , we 'll stop for pancakes , then we 'll get laid . wuddya think ?

where is pancakes hause ?

i 'll see you tomorrow .

look . i 'm not gon na debate you , jerry . the price is now the whole amount . we want the entire eighty thousand .

well , i 'm sorry , but i just - i -

that 's right . and we need more money .

blood has been shed , jerry .

okay , jerry . you 're tasking us to perform this mission , but you , you wo n't , uh , you wo n't - aw , fuck it , let 's take a look at that ciera .

well , it 's all just part of this - they do n't know i need it , see . okay , so there 's that . and even if they did , i would n't get it . so there 's that on top , then . see , these 're personal matters .

okay .

well , okay , it 's -

huh ?

well , he never done this before , but seein ' as it 's special circumstances and all , he says i can knock one hunnert off that trucoat .

i sat right here and said i did n't want no trucoat !

and this guy is ...

had dinner at a place called the king 's table . buffet style . it was pretty darn good .

not on your feet too much ?

prowler needs a jump .

and this shep proudfoot character , he 's a little darling . he 's now wanted for assault and parole violation . he clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps , and he 's at large .

geez . looks like this thing goes higher than we thought . you call his home ?

i got ta tell ya , wade , i 'm leanin ' to jerry 's viewpoint here .

he was killed serving project mayhem .

cornelius ! how are you ?

just who the fuck do you think you are ? ! get out ! you 're fired !

i must 've left the original in the copy machine .

he was full of pep . must 've had his grande latte enema .

no . no , sir . i loved that condo . i loved every stick of furniture . the lamps , the chairs , the rugs , were me . the dishes were me . the plants were ...

what does that mean ?

dynamite ?

the dynamite ...

this is detective stern with the arson unit . we have some new information about the `` incident '' at your condo .

i ca n't let myself see where you 're going . go wherever it takes you , remember ... keep away from major cities ...

do this for me , marla . do this for me , if you never do anything else ...

what ? ! you 're sorry ? i do n't believe that for a minute .

whatever . i 'll take my food to go ...

two sides ? you 're dr. jeckle and mr. jackass .

i do n't want to hear anything you 've got to say .

what is wrong with you ?

because the answer 's `` yes '' or because the answer 's `` no ? ''

what ?

nothing .

no , thanks .

what the hell are you doing here ?

picture yourself watching marla singer throw herself around her crummy apartment .

like testicular cancer ?

where have you been the last few weeks ?

well , technically , i have more of a right to be there than you . you still have your balls .

a year ? how 'd you manage that ?

hello ?

yes ... it 's a test .

excuse me ? `` throwers ? ''

appreciate something .

you will . you know you will .

why ... why ... why ... ?

yes .

defuse the bomb ?

ask me nicely .

since when is project mayhem about murder ?

what about marla ?

oh , yeah . i did n't really know my dad ...

what ... ?

`` training ? '' tyler ...

`` applicant ? ''

`` too young ? ''

i 'm not asking you to .

you choose your level of involvement . i wo n't make decisions for you .

what the hell ... ? !

what are you doing ? !

what should i have told you ?

why was n't i told about `` project mayhem ? ''

what are we doing ?

stop it . this is your pain -- your burning hand . it 's right here . look at it .

do n't mention me .

`` the liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception . ''

she 'd invaded my support groups , now she 's invading my home .

hey ... do n't knock librarians .

we 've crossed the threshold . you want to call it off ?

is it ?

alright , go crazy . let 'er rip .

this is crazy .

i do n't know , either . i want to find out . i 've never been hit , have you ?

i do n't know about this .

... oh , yeah . oh , yeah .

-- like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films .

insurance 'll cover it .

this is how i met --

look what we 've accomplised . thirty seconds .

... i ... ann ... .iinn.. ff ... .nnyin ...

listen , something is going to happen , something terrible ...

his name is robert paulson !

robert paulson is dead . he 's dead , because of you ...

did you hear what i just said ? !

s-s-stuff .

another premonition ?

no . if anyone dies from a crash now , it 'll be me . but i ca n't die if eugene and isabella are still alive . i 'm last on death 's list .

please , what else could it mean ?

i can practically taste the water in my throat . and something else . the smell of flowers ...

i ... i ...

the survivors of flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash . that was death 's original design .

kimberly burroughs , eh ? what do you want ?

here we go . the vehicle 's a delivery van registered to jorge and isabella cruz . and christ , there 's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two .

should we knock ?

that 's why death is working backwards . it 's tying up all the loose ends , sealing the rift once and for all this chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie . in order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay , it has not been edited .

jury duty ? that 's randomly selected by social security numbers .

dano , should n't we stop and help your mother ?

evan shaeffer 's dead . guess he was n't as lucky as we thought .

i 've got to stop and help those people .

anyway , i guessed it right and won these .

i think a nurse named kalarjian is going to choke isabella to death !

like what ?

there 's going to be a huge accident ! everyone 's gon na die . all of us ! i saw it !

i ... i do n't know .

sure .

hey , do n't be knockin ' the chevette .

that it 's not over yet .

you think ... you think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what ?

mom ?

get out ! get out of the car ! get out of the fuckin ' car !

most kids do , i guess .

like ... 4:25 .

then , let 's go see him !

is that something you 're `` feeling ? ''

i 've never dealt with death before . i was n't alive when my grandparents died . i wish i could know . i mean , all this ... could just be in our heads . now it feels like it 's everywhere .

he 's not a witch .

but i saved him . i intervened . just like the plane . that 's the design .

alright , browning , you fuckin ' warlock ... did you know about ms. lewton , or what ?

i 'll remove him .

c'mon , man , like you really thought you were gon na tittie fuck 'em over greenland , or something ?

me , right ? that 's why you 're not saying .

may as well go out under my own free will , right ?

hell . this is just like fucking star wars , man !

really ? how come he did n't take me ?

wow !

you mean the snake ?

it 's orders ! you remember ... when they tell you to do something and then you do it . john wayne is dead , man .

let me see .

buddhist monastery . fifteenth century .

you wan na know why i stood up for this show ?

that 's it ? some c-4 , a map and a knife ?

where 's your stuff ?

batteries not included .

ninety .

what was that ?

how you going to get there ? you ca n't trust the spooks to pull you out . they 'll use you up and throw you away .

yeah . got some business there . what are you gon na do ?

in-vul-nerabo . but you get ass kicked without me .

i do ?

took bus , most of way . i knew you would come here .

are you okay ?

sure . i only sound like forty-year- old in your language .

it means `` virgin . '' my mother was comedian .

all this is for us ?

we just take pictures ?

i 'm authorized to get you out of here . i thought that 's what you wanted .

so there never was a phase two rescue team ?

what 's up ?

can you walk ?

man , you are one scary-looking motherfucker !

let 's do it .

i just wanted ... i do n't know ... after all that ... i just wanted one person , one person , to come up to me and say `` you did good , john . '' and mean it . that 's all . after all that .

there were treating me like a headcase .

am i out of here ?

seems like i 'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other , does n't it ?

you know , let me tell you something ! i 'm not that kind of person . i do n't do people favors . if i talk to you it 's because i want to . so we 're not all ... uh ... jerri hall ... big deal ... what a boring world if we were . you do the best you can with what you got . you 're not so so invisible , ya know ... you want make an impression ? try this ; you can be a real bitch .

what ?

fine .

well , do n't say it like that . it 's not so ... ya know , crazy an idea . you are a healthy woman ... you hold a steady job . ya not crossed eyed or anything ...

yes ! they 'll be in soon .

no , i want to talk to you now . i have to explain something about ...

what ?

yes .

shut up ...

i 'm not faking anything . i 'm looking for some bath oil ...

it 's convenient to fake looking for something right now , is n't it ?

you think i 'm a fake .

at being a fake .

wait ...

nothing . it 's just that ... i picked the easiest piece i could remember . i think i first played it when i was 8 years old and i played it better then .

of course i do . it 's music . you know ...

i have played a few times . here and there . as a matter of fact , i was once a rehearsal pianist for a las vegas musical revue .

i mean , how could you not play anymore ? that 's so strange to me ...

that 's right . have you anything to suggest ?

what ?

four or five years .

i 've got an extra jacket behind the seat , if you want to put it on .

i do eat slow as a bird , whereas bobby can put it away like a speed swing ... is there any ketchup around ?

i do n't know where you were , penis envy .

i would n't be a waitress . they 're nasty and full of crap .

well ...

and you know , i read where they invented this car that runs on ... that runs on ... when you boil water ...

oh ... i 'm sorry . was i singing again ?

yes .

there 's a rumor that you were tryin ' to get somebody to beat me up .

i aint got ta prove nothin ' to no girl , 'cause i got it like dat .

i feel like dirt . they even want to know what he 's doing in utah ?

would you like me to change anything ?

you do n't have to run with me , crease .

hey , what are you doing ?

i do n't know how he does n't know . he does n't know .

what 'll it be fletch ?

you ca n't keep me here .

i said i 'll take care of it . now , a man of your position should n't be a part of what 's about to go down . so go home and i 'll call you tomorrow .

fat sam left the beach today . so did gummy . it began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe i should be aware of .

under control ? you idiot . you did n't know who he was ?

i hope they still fit . do i get to keep the glove ?

yes , but the very end , when he actually died , that was extremely sudden . you know , alan and i were recently speaking of dying . told me boyd aviation took out a lot of insurance on him . you must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy .

you do n't have a piece of the action ?

affirmative .

that 's it ?

i 'm fine .

where am i ?

read this , please .

what ?

of course .

regulations , mr. stanwyk . and you and your wife , named ... .

what are you doing here ?

i 'm calling the police . then i 'm leaving . you wait here for them .

i know . i got bad luck or something .

i do n't think you 'll have to worry about that .

would n't they normally be locked ?

charmed .

check every hotel in l.a. start with the ones near the airport . yeah . he 's about to leave the country with her . thanks , lar .

nothing to it .

'stanwyk 's parents , marvin and velma stanwyk , also of provo , were unable to attend the wedding . '

oh , we 've got lots of pictures . let me show you some .

i 'm telling you he 's not your husband at all .

what 's wrong , gail ?

act natural .

trust you ? i may seem a little goofy at times , but i 'm not a complete bozo , you know .

you saw a forgery .

because i 'm bored . oh , that sounds terrible , does n't it . i 'm sorry . if it makes you feel any better , i also let you in because i 'm hungry .

why 'd you let me in ?

no . i mean , 'no you ca n't ask me that . ' i mean , ask me something else .

who is it ?

i 'm such a heel . how 'd you guess ?

i bet you do .

you should play with much larger tennis balls . so how 's alan ?

that 's a strange combination .

john ultrarelamensky .

far out . larry ? it 's fletch . well , it 's not 'fat sam 's ' , but ... any port in a storm . oh , tell frank i need a couple of months . the fifty grand 's lasting longer than i thought .

yes , i 'm with the underhills .

i spoke to her last week . she did n't say anything .

she moved out ?

i 'm out , frank . you lost faith in me .

what ...

he threw me in a cell , took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if i did n't promise to give up the story .

very possibly . come on , say yes . i 'll buy you a shirt .

just give me a hint , all right ?

i really do n't want to spoil your surprise , frank . why do n't you read it tomorrow ?

who ?

what 's the spread on the game tonight ?

two ...

no , i want an answer , is the story done ?

who 's frieda ?

yeah .

in a minute !

john !

yes ?

hold that thought . are we being shot at ?

lots of things . her favorite yogurt . the ten drummers she would take to a desert island ...

listen , queen collie , i have a code . i never , ever , drop a case . besides , i , uh , used all your money to pay my bills , so i kinda owe you .

so you know about johnny crunch and myself .

five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree .

now that we 've broken the ice ...

poor taste . i know . listen , i respect homosexuals . when i was young , my maid was a homosexual . my maid was a homosexual .

thanks for the promotion , man .

hey , don , how 's the high blood pressure .

i 've heard cars fuck with more harmony .

i have n't seen her around , and as for who would want to kill johnny crunch , line forms to the left . you 'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive .

you got ta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and i do n't mean your legs . why did n't you jump on her ? what 's happening to you ?

so many assholes , so few bullets .

c.d.s . the music kind . from the grendel label .

your timing swallows the massive one . grendel just tried to kill us , he 's about to frame and kiss don , and we ca n't do shit . do n't even ask about those discs . goddamn that art mooney with a star by his name ! it 's tied to johnny 's c.d. , i know .

hello , ford ...

a fucking c.d . wow , this case is closed . so , she 's got bad taste in music and in men ... did i tell you she and johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it ?

how 'd you get this from her ?

you going to be okay ?

let 's just declare war on the hellhole . before they make < u > crocodile dundee < /u > three .

fucking australians ! i hate that country , continent , what is it ? do n't we do nuclear testing there ?

oh . three hundred coming right up .

you gave it to the girls for one .

artartartartmooneymooneymooney mooney .

oh how sweet , your friend 's got his own star .

you wish . come on , let 's get outta here .

let 's watch some 'm.t.v . '

you did n't ask . have you ever thought about mousse ?

yeah , it 's weird . bobby and johnny were such good friends ...

come again ? b.fl.d. , i have sex with rock stars ; it 's not like i 'm doing something that i do n't enjoy with them , like shuffleboard . do n't worry about me , i practice safe sex and next summer , i 'm going to u.c.l.a .

uh ... wha ? you 're supposed to answer those questions , not ask 'em . i take it a woman named colleen sutton is not your big sister and that the late d.j . johnny crunch ai n't your daddy ?

why are all these people after me ?

fuck that , i mean , the heck with that . i kicked their ass ! well , i tried . there were two of them you know ...

when you going to let me work with you ? why you always fucking with me ?

it 's some psycho killer groupie . i got an anonymous letter that says she killed bobby vomit , johnny crunch , and now , this society dame .

really ?

why do you hate me ? it 's got ta be more than me private you , you cop .

say cheese ...

accident ? accident ! you naive pussball , when i realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry . i < u > cut my fucking < /u > < u > ears off < /u > so i 'd only hear < u > my < /u > music . here , look .

man , julian , that accident took away more than your hearing .

and may i suggest for dessert , the five copies i made ...

oh please , ford , i 'll do any --

i just gave up smoking . a last drink ?

< u > okay < /u > ! okay . you got me . boy , you guys are tough . i have the third disc . indeed . i. do . yes , sir . yeah you assholes , it 's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if i do n't make a phone call by seven o'clock . so if you 'll excuse us ...

oh god , please , < u > do n't < /u > !

yeah , i did , you condescending fuck , but i miss snoopy coming out at the end . is n't your enjoyment impaired ?

i 'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff .

only on a first name basis .

do you really know everybody in the industry ?

'bye , johnny ...

what ?

there 's nothing around . nobody 's holding .

you do n't use shit ?

sal --

-- well finish all your meetin ' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you .

did you ever sit on the edge of the bed , take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes ?

enchant . alain , j'ai rflchi votre proposition et j'ai dcid d'accepter .

it 's yours too !

you must take me for an imbecile . why do you think i asked you to meet me in washington ? i have n't spent five minutes in new york city without the company of a gendarme .

everything 's smooth . beautiful . i will need a few more days though , the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there 's no heat .

allo ... salvatore ...

what 's your story ?

a piece of ass would n't kill me .

nothing in there except a new york street map .

bill , keep shootin ' your mouth off and i 'll knock you into the middle of next week .

i say we keep sittin ' on boca .

this fella nicoli 's got a record in france , walter . he 's wanted for questioning in the murder of a french cop .

all right , i 'm with you . i just hope we know what the hell we 're doing .

how ?

whatta we do now ?

what do i tell them ?

what if the radio stops working ? christ , what if i ca n't reach you again ?

i do know . i 'm a cop . this is what i do .

i do n't know , john . i 'm a fire fighter . this is ... this is different .

they will if they catch him in the act . you can make that happen , dad . you can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment .

what kinda twisted animal .

jesus christ ... that 's ... ten days from now . how ?

chief ? ! is that you ?

but that 's tomorrow .

what 's that ?

nah , i gave it up .

1998 ... ? this is wrong . who are you ? why are you doing this ?

that 's impossible .

nothing ... i just spilled something .

w ... b ... 2 ... yxb .

i 'm right with you , man . he 's got the heart of a lion . hey , how 'bout the first game of the series ?

where are you transmitting from ?

uh , hello ?

you got a deal , mister . i mean santa .

the ham radio . that 's how come he did n't die in the fire .

huh ?

not the first time that 's been true . i 'm telling you , i got a feeling about this guy . this is the guy , satch .

our lucky break . mario id 'd the dental . mary finelli ... reported missing april 16 , 1968 .

and i 'm tired of the i 'm sorrys . i do n't need 'em . what i need is a partner i can count on . i care about you . not cause of me and your old man . not cause of your mom . but because of you .

whoa , i just ... i just ...

my six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman . right after he retires from the majors . we just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday .

oh , i loved it . i wish you 'd gone .

you have the right to remain silent . if you give up that right ...

oh . sorry . how so ?

just came by to wrap up over there . thought i 'd say `` hello . ''

what is that ?

would you be yourself ... ... if you looked this this ?

where 's shelly ?

i did n't mean it the way it sounded ...

yes , man !

when you dropped me off at the house , it was very late . my parents were waiting up for me . as soon as i got in the door , they starting yelling and cursing at me . i was so upset ... i told them i slept with you . my mothers slapped me . that was the first time she 'd ever hit me . i could n't believe it . i ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as i could run . i was crying . they had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and i wanted to punish them for that . i decided to hide out all night . they 'd be so worried that they 'd be sorry for what they did to me . the woods were cold and damp from the rain . i found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and i guess i fell asleep . all i can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps . i thought it was my father so i hid behind the tree . but the footsteps just stopped . the woods were dark . i could n't see anything . i heard a cracking noise behind me . i turned around and ... and ... oh , god ... there was this hideous looking man . so grotesque he was almost inhuman . he had a knife and he started to slash away at me , again and again . i was so hysterical and i do n't know how i was able to get away . i ran and ran , but he kept coming . he was big but so fast . he caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he ... he ... ripped my blouse off . i was screaming , but who could hear me ? then ... oh , god ... he dragged me by the hair along the ground . i was kicking and yelling . he dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods . oh , please ... please ...

what do you mean ?

why do n't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset . it 'll mellow you out .

this is too painful to look at .

goldilocks and the three bears ?

what ?

you have n't changed a bit . always so sure of yourself . even when we were kids , when you wanted something , nothing could stop you .

i 'm sorry . i just wanted to surprise you . what can i say ?

i do like you . but not when you act like a jerk .

bullseye !

are they following us ?

we 're gon na scare him ? !

darren , we better turn around .

whaddya mean ?

he sure chose the right day to pull this shit .

you become a whole other person when you 're out here , stan . and i do n't like it .

wait a minute . i just ...

okay , give it back .

no .

it 's all over .

you got it . just keep an eye out for roadblocks .

then let 's get goin ' . we can argue on the way . you tell me what you need ... ... i 'll make sure you get in .

well , grown-ups think it 's funny to be scared .

i do n't know . he called somebody , then took off .

yeah , we 're here .

if you 'd just go to the cemetery , you 'll see i 'm not lying .

tommy jarvis . we got ta do something . he 's even more powerful now that ...

hold it . whoa ... what 's your name , son ?

yeah , that 'd be a big shame ...

well , let 's hope not !

you food 'll be right out .

yeah , she 's good , considering . that kid just takes everything in stride .

steven buggin ' you ?

okay .

tell me .

why do n't you blow me , chief . after your girlfriend gets through .

i 'm gon na get your outta this . just hang tight . okay ?

are you crazy ? !

got ta go . see you guys later .

wan na know how i did that ?

hell , when steven was a kid , he was like , having strippers delivered to church bingos and shit .

about jessica .

i know what it sounds like .

i 've told you the truth .

oh , my dear god ...

that was truly excellent .

i have her in creative writing and she 's fairly nice .

my stepmom could n't care less , but daddy would have a shit fit . he might even pay some attention to me .

what are you going to do ?

more or less . it 's part of my college fund .

right .

he 's doing the best he can , charles .

jim miller and suzy donaldson never showed up . i 'm a little concerned .

oh , he is indeed . and ready to pull down anybody who falls in and ca n't swim .

i 'll take some lessons this time . i promise .

whatever you 've been ... imagining ... has nothing to do with jason voorhees . i want you to be safe , rennie . that 's all i care about .

but sean said ...

no . it was just a normal summer . i 've never been able to figure it out .

when did this start ?

i had a skiing accident in high school , broke my left leg . it took three winters before i would even look at the snow again ... but the solution kept eluding me . i finally took lessons . i 've never broken a bone since .

really ?

the captain and chief engineer ... they 've been ... they 're dead .

i 'm not ! !

but rennie ...

i did n't mean for you to go !

i think so . but we have to lower the anchors so we do n't drift any further ...

can he really take us home ?

i loved my taxi . went twelve hours nonstop . stopped only to pee . i peed under the manhattan bridge . peed many times in parks and playgrounds .

i used to drive a taxi .

we were thinking of putting in a pool .

it 's your best play , nicky .

that was a big mistake .

do n't wait efor me .

you will suffer because he is in the theater . and you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears .

i 'm completely stunned . i do n't want this to happen .

i do n't want to hear about it .

this could pbe it .

it 's your best play , nicky .

in and out of bed .

it ca n't be all that personal .

they can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic . there 's a much bigger thing going on than tonight 's opening .

they 're watching him closely . there 's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon . to bolster his confidence . and that 's not all .

our peter ?

apparently it did n't help . you know about peter , of course .

i talked to her two days ago .

look . i 'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men . but you 're only eighteen . we can still turn it around .

take it yourself . take a date .

laurel . tickets are all set . i double-checked .

i did n't turn her into mother . you did .

she is kicking you out .

do n't be so steely-eyed . it 's that course you 're taking in criminology .

because you refuse to believe she 's serious . you 've always refused .

what else ?

names are incredibly intimate . we barely know each other . trust me on this .

this could be it !

one more out .

i respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi . but let 's put a lid on the questions .

what happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you ?

you tell your friends your father used to work the docks . callused hands . but you had an attitude when you were growing up that was n't easy for your mother and me to understand .

i 'll go get you another one . you have to wear it .

let 's not start that again .

since when did that matter ?

hey , pop . i know you do n't like the commotion of opening night . but i especially want you to see this play . it 's new territory for me . and for you too . i have to know what you think .

the red sox are your problem . i never understood about you and the red sox . everybody rooted for the yankees .

it was rummy , not poker . but i 'll take a chance and let you in .

where are your glasses ? go get them .

it 's a simple subject .

i do n't know toyota . what does he do ?

hey , toyota . he asked me a question .

call me frankie . and it looks like we 're going nowhere .

matthew , look at him . when i lived in roxbury , the media followed this man everywhere . he was bigger than ten movie stars . where 's your white lincoln limo ?

everybody else does . why not you ?

i 'm looking at you trying to think . put your face in the mirror . i know i recognize you from somewhere .

the red sox were my world . i surrendered my existence to a team that could n't win the big one .

'm not worried about this kid .

when the mets lose , they just lose . it 's a flat feeling . but the red sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game . defeats that keep you awake , that pound in your head like the hammer of fate .

how come ?

but i know you , do n't i ? i seen you on a poster in the theater district . i 'll think of your name in just a --

what color ?

but my parasite is consuming all the new memories . eating my lines .

i kissed shirley felder on the teeth .

yes .

he goes to the theater armed .

never mind .

steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy . no friends . no phone .

not one of steven 's finer moments .

and i thought , at last , she 's here , she wants me .

you 've come to me . i wanted to believe you would one day .

there 's no room ! and the air is lovely .

i am your wife .

no . that is what you get for distracting me .

not quite . they 're only `` holding me '' until the magistrate 's hearing . then it will be prison .

what are you doing ?

well , we shall try .

i 'll take your luggage back , baas .

maybe i 'm wrong ... maybe we 're not ready yet . in south africa the numbers were small ...

that 's right . the word only means `` community . '' but it could stand for `` village '' ... or the world .

well , it 's quite a place , your `` ashram '' -- is that right ?

no ... no . in every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other .

after what they did at the massacre -- it 's only an eye for an eye .

we hope you intend to join us in the struggle for home rule , mr. gandhi .

i must say when i first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in bombay i never thought i 'd be greeting you as a national hero .

do n't worry -- i 've never seen men so determined . you 've given them a way to fight ... and i do n't think --

somehow i expected not .

bapu -- please . where are you going .

have you found him ?

there are a few million miles to go yet .

you almost sound like you believe that .

er , no ...

and do n't go getting everybody lost out there . you 'll give us a bad name . you wo n't have me to keep an eye on you , you know .

so we have two choices . either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and i do n't know anybody that thirsty or ... ... he < i > is < /i > here . we test again . you 're right , hugo , this was a desperate act . someone had a lot to lose that night -- perhaps their place in line . i 'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission .

from what budget ?

a man can change his face -- but blood is forever . sample every employee within the parameters i gave you . intravenous .

do n't underestimate these imposters .

this < i > is < /i > the most likely location --

twelve have a mission within the week .

thank you , no .

surely you know what you have .

hello .

everybody goes there .

what are you talking about ?

at least up there your piss will be worth something . you 'll all be showering in it , right ?

the mission director .

if anybody asks , tell them the truth -- your family disowns you . you are a disappointment , jerome .

i have to know where you come from .

it happened in australasia . he checked in yesterday . no family complications , no record he ever broke his neck . as far as anybody 's concerned , he 's still a walking , talking , fully-productive member of society . you just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life . excuse me , < i > your < /i > life .

i hope he 's not just a body .

come on .

let 's walk .

why would i be angry ? it was beautiful .

just some in-valid . vincent -- -- somebody .

friend ?

no .

new policy .

antonio --

honey , look around you . the world does n't want one like < i > that < /i > one .

not like < i > this < /i > one .

-- i 've read your profile . i do n't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own . you can have other children .

get it over with ...

the obvious . but we are both not interested in that right now .

so we did that crackerbox ... to cover for you .

a simple reason , mccoy . the obvious reason . to rob a bank .

you hired jackson and rudy. , not me .

and you got him ...

what about them ?

i get my own help .

we walk .

laughlin . he 's always got his family around ... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses .

oh , jesus ... how ?

sounds good .

i do n't want to hear it .

i want to say something .

it 's all a game , do n't bother me .

do what i tell you , it 's not a game .

i think so ... i do n't know .

el paso .

i 'll tell you something , doc . one day you 're going to have to trust somebody ...

el paso .

if beynon bought him out , and he talked then maybe beynon 's boys will be waiting for us in el paso .

i did n't mean police .

i mean it .

what do we do ?

let 's send his cut back -- just keep going .

there are three men dead .

call the ranch , tell beynotr we 'll leave his cut here --

i know you do . but it is different . it 's different . we 'll be all right tomorrow .

nail him first , be careful he does n't panic and want to shoot somebody . local police have one car , a rover , should n't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it 's answering an emergency call ... if the cop car shows up remember it does n't have any automatic weapons . only a shotgun braced on the dashboard . get into a tight spot , you 'll be out of range at forty yards . then they 're down to their side guns .

i did n't . i just waited .

better than i remembered .

how was it ?

that beynon 's got a long arm .

just like old times ?

no way . i 've got to get out now .

three years ago i dynamited some fish at the reservoir .

sure can . i 'd like an invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel .

it 's just a walk-in bank . you do n't have to be dillinger for this one .

suit yourself .

you were with him ?

chicago .

my lady'11 come in in about five minutes . have some food sent up in half an hour .

go with god .

how about twenty thousand ?

you got it .

suit yourself .

a ford ... we have a ford .

the glucose will begin working in half an hour . you 'll feel better then ...

and you told brumby ?

yes .

i know . i know .

oh ay ?

jack , you 're wrong .

address ?

brumby !

i 've been asked to make sure you do n't .

that 's nice .

good evening .

you bloody whore . frank was too careful to die like that . who killed him ?

why 'd you see him so regular ?

nothing more ? just another feller ?

he was all right to me .

i want to talk to you later .

is it one of kinnear 's films ?

should n't think so .

he wo n't . he thinks i 'm simple .

do n't worry . he 's meeting the architects at the restaurant .

he must have been pretty sure i 'd come .

nasty .

to the demon king 's castle , of course .

you did n't know you had a fairy godmother , did you ?

yeah , i 'll do you a favour .

i know him too .

no . it 's all right .

look , look . get your suit cleaned .

i 'm sorry . here . this 'll pay for a course in karate .

where you off to ?

old thorpey ? have n't seen him in a long time .

how 'd you know albert ?

what 's that supposed to mean ?

how 'd you know i would n't ?

and what you going to do ?

eh ? have a drink .

jack ! i did n't like that .

they 're still the same . piss holes in the snow .

that 's all right , eric .

gerald phoned us in the middle of the night , said he 'd heard you 've been making a nuisance of yourself .

what ? and get the clap ?

no .

you 're not seeing me ?

all right . two hundred .

that 's what you pay to find out . right , jack ?

can we get some coffee ... ?

i lied . alright ? my end is my business . your end 's twenty-five . in or out . you tell me , you 're out you take the consequences .

you have to go in . you have to get the leads .

that 's right , the guys are moving them downtown . after the thirtieth . murray and mitch . after the contest .

a job with graff .

yes . twenty-five hundred apiece . one night 's work , and the job with graff . working the premium leads .

is that what i said ?

you did n't ?

not actually , no .

talking about it as a ...

yes .

someone should hurt them .

i want to tell you what somebody should do .

... you 're absolutely right .

that 's what i ...

he made up those rules , and we 're working for him .

with river oaks ?

yes .

... that 's right ...

that 's right ?

and now ...

they did .

you did ?

i 'd never try to sell an indian .

you had to , yeah . why ?

you missed a fucking sale . big deal . a deadbeat polack . big deal . how you going to sell 'em in the first place ... ? your mistake , you shoun ' a took the lead .

will you excuse us please ?

yes .

why ? because they 're stupid . `` where were you last night ... ''

yeah .

the check 's no good ?

only the beginning ...

i ...

what ?

it was his idea .

who kept the other half ?

i sold them to jerry graff .

i ...

no . it had n't .

i told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank .

what are you talking about ?

what are you trying to tell me ?

yes . mmm . yes . precisely . precisely . 'cause your partner depends on it . i 'm talking to you , i 'm trying to tell you something .

all that i 'm telling you : that one thing you can tell them it 's a remarkable sale .

did you tell 'em my sale ?

i ca n't split them .

bullshit . they ai n't been in the office yet . give 'em some stiff . we have a deal or not ? eh ? two sits . the des plaines . both of 'em , six and ten , you can do it ... six and ten ... eight and eleven , i do n't give a shit , you set 'em up ? alright ? the two sits in des plaines .

i 'm not sure i have two .

john . listen . i want to talk to you . permit me to do this a second . i 'm older than you . a man acquires a reputation . on the street . what he does when he 's up , what he does otherwise ... i said `` ten , '' you said `` no . '' you said `` twenty . '' i said `` fine , '' i 'm not going to fuck with you , how can i beat that , you tell me ? ... okay . okay . we 'll ... okay . fine . we 'll ... alright , twenty percent , and fifty bucks a lead . that 's fine . for now . that 's fine . a month or two we 'll talk . a month from now . next month . after the thirtieth . we 'll talk .

and what if you do n't close .

then put me on the board .

i 've seen those leads . i saw them when i was at homestead , we pitched those cocksuckers rio rancho nineteen sixty-nine they would n't buy . they could n't buy a fucking toaster . they 're broke , john . they 're cold . they 're deadbeats , you ca n't judge on that . even so . even so . alright . fine . fine . even so . i go in , four fucking leads they got their money in a sock . they 're fucking polacks , john . four leads . i close two . two . fifty per ...

harriett ...

you sold eight mountain view ?

to negotiate what ? to negotiate what ?

what ... ? say the words .

she wo n't listen .

and when was that check cashed ?

jim , jim , you saw my book ... i ca n't , you saw my book ...

why did she do that , jim ?

lingk . james lingk .

well , let 's have a couple more . my name is richard roma , what 's yours ?

yes .

they took 'em ...

you 've grown so tall ... so tall in the last year . you 're much taller than me .

yes .

go on , answer him when he talks to you . tell him : columbus , marconi ... garibaldi .

who is the greatest man you can think of ?

your friend lives in a fine building .

what can we do ?

well , thank you , they asked for you all week .

i hated you for so long , michael ; for so many years . i think i did things to myself , to hurt myself , so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too . but i understand you now ; i think i do . you were being strong for all of us , like papa was . and i forgive you , and want to be close to you now . ca n't you forgive fredo ; he 's so sweet , and helpless without you .

it was my father 's money ; and i 'm entitled to what i need . where is tom hagen ?

don francesco . you murdered my husband , because he would not bend . and his oldest son paolo , because he swore revenge . but vitone is only nine , and dumb-witted . he never speaks .

you 're a good fellow .

i understand ...

otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute . of course , if my information as to your gains is incorrect , i 'll dip my beak just a little . just a little , but no less than one hundred dollars , and do n't try to deceive me , eh paisan ?

i did n't turn against nobody ; he turned against me .

... who ?

tonight we 've been invited to a reception at the presidential palace ; to bring in the new year . you and i will go in a special car that 's being sent . they 'll have cocktails ... then dinner , and a reception with the president . when it 's over , it will be suggested that you take questadt and his friends from washington to spend the night with some women . i 'll go home alone in the car ; and before i reach the hotel , i 'll be assassinated .

mike , are you crazy , i 'm your brother .

what 's that ?

i 'd like to come along . there 's been a lot of strain , and i 've been cooped up in this room for three days .

great , havana 's great . lots of activity in havana ! anybody i know here . five-angels ? anybody ?

we 're making an investment in havana .

roberto . who owns the 'rat-holes . '

because he knows them ; he knows they have no one to protect them . vitone ? what do you think of my angel ?

kay ... kay ...

am i a prisoner ?

that 's off now .

i ca n't let him down .

no , i have confidence in their loyalty ... but this is life and death , and tom , you are my brother .

if you need anything , just ...

what 's up ?

yeah . he would n't even go out to dinner . just wanted to go home .

do you owe markers ?

you know there 's a senate investigating committee recently set up ; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name .

very well .

sir , my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity . he has not taken that fifth amendment as it was his right to do , and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing , counsel advised him to do . so , i think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record .

i 'm going to the market .

you have n't heard me .

i 'm sorry about some of the people i had to see today . it was bad timing ... but it could n't be helped .

right here .

i 'm alright . will you stay home for awhile ?

i would n't consider anyone else .

it 's always bad for business ; but you have no choice .

pentangeli is a dead man ; do you object ?

the incident of the other night is a nuisance that i can take care of . i came to you because i want nothing to affect our agreement ; i wanted to clear everything i 'm going to do with you , just in case .

so , that occurred to me .

mike , i do n't understand . do n't ask me to do that .

i want you to settle on their terms .

how can you be fair with animals ? they recruit niggers and spicks ; they do violence in their own grandmother 's neighborhoods . and everything is dope and whores ; the gambling is left to last . let me run my family without you on my back . i want them taken care of .

frankie , you 're a good old man , and you 've been loyal to my father for years ... so i hope you can explain what you mean .

then carmine fucillo and tony blue derosa will need to be fitted for slabs .

the same assurance we got from you .

pari persu ; what the fuck is pari persu ... ?

like hell ! and who the hell are you to give me orders . watch your manners or you 'll be on your sicilian ass in the street there .

damn straight . i 'm sick of playing games .

you know , i just ca n't do that anymore . i still have time to get things right . get married again --

it 's different . he 's a man . and by the way you have no business calling him a homo .

if he were that famous , he probably would n't give me the time of day . this way , he 's like < u > my < /u > famous person . yeah , my own personal famous person . who treats me like i 'm somebody worth talking to .

these old movies are such a hoot . they thought they were being scary , but they 're just funny .

but i did n't do this !

take care of mr. whale like he was your flesh and blood .

i need to talk to you about mr. whale .

well ... no , not really --

that is why he must go to hell . i do not think it fair . but god 's law is not for us to judge .

of course . i am married still .

what kind of man are you ? are you a good man ?

nothing i did n't deserve .

oh clayton .

you 're crazy .

i have n't done a damn thing with you !

wait until i tell my friends i had you naked in my arms . wo n't they be surprised ?

james whale . this afternoon at the party .

i 'm very sorry .

my old man was a marine . he enlisted the day he turned seventeen .

come now . i 'm sure you came across such situations in korea . a wounded comrade , or perhaps one of the enemy ? someone for whom death would be a blessing .

is that -- ?

it 's not like her .

catch my death .

run for what ?

neither of us really belongs here .

are you enjoying yourself ?

david produced her last picture .

nothing of importance . just two old men slapping each other with lilies . shall we have a drink ?

just go . please . why do n't you go ?

you 're very clever , mr. boone . you just sit there and let me talk . what a sorry old man , you 're thinking . what a crazy old poof . why are you here ? what do you want from me ?

barnett . was that his name ? leonard barnett . he came to the front straight from harrow . and he looked up to me . unlike the others , he did n't care that i was a workingman impersonating his betters . how strange , to be admired so blindly . i suppose he loved me . but chastely , like a schoolboy .

what about your stint in korea ? i 'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes .

i 'd like to sit for you again . but only if you ease up on the locker room talk . okay ?

the extras are in their places . now we need the star . would n't you like to get in the pool ?

of course , they were n't nearly as bashful . no , this room was once filled with bare buttocks . and pricks . hard , arrogant pricks --

how long were you ... ?

so we understand each other ?

no . at least not in the legal sense .

proud ? any jerk with a gun can kill someone .

it 's nothing to be ashamed of , in the service of one 's country . that 's something to be proud of .

of course . i had to make it interesting for myself , you see . a comedy about death . the trick is not to ruin it for anyone who is n't in on the joke . but the monster never receives any of my gibes . he is noble . noble and misunderstood .

i liked it . we all did .

i do n't mind . i 'm not crazy about my old man either .

dripping ? do you ever eat dripping in this country ? the fat from roasts and such , congealed in jars . used like butter on bread .

pish posh , mr. boone . i 'm not your aunt tilly .

sure , everybody does . when i was a kid i 'd go with my sister twice a week . why ? were you an actor or something ?

mornin ' .

hey , boone .

but i have no reputation . i 'm as free as the air .

should you be drinking in your condition ?

oh , david . there 's no pleasure in making you feel guilty . you better go , my boy . you 'll be late for that aeroplane .

take the luminal to sleep , or whenever you feel an attack coming on .

i would 've thought mr. leslie howard would be more your line .

my god . is the audience to presume that colin and i have done her hair ? i thought we were mad scientists , not hairdressers .

i 'd hardly call our yardman a friend .

he is not going to kill the old man ?

yes ?

bone ? boom ? something bee . i hire him while you were in the hospital . he came cheap .

i commend you . if you 're going to pursue poofs , go after those who can do favors for you . you waste everybody 's time when you court dinosaurs .

just like going swimming , is n't it ?

can that count as one question ?

too warm for a sweater , anyway .

it is , is n't it ? my life as a game of strip poker . shall we play ?

your father was a schoolmaster ?

nice . and your lighting and camera angles . you 're got to go back to german silent movies to find anything like it .

one likes to live simply .

what 's with the fish thing -- ?

who do you think ?

do n't feel the need to explore my family dynamics , atley ...

i do n't know about that , randall . he did such a good job on this paper . and another one just came in ...

well , now , he 's clear . and you 'll stay away from him ...

sound it out for me .

they gave me two weeks . i wasted most of it with your brother and his crew , who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost , but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor , making this even more difficult to achieve ...

were it only that easy . i have obligations . the order needs to be filled ...

grow up . you do n't kill people like me . people like me die in their sleep at 87 ... do you know why ? because if you did kill me , and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they 'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over california ...

now . where were we ? oh , yes . kip .

good . cos you know how it plays . six years ago , i let you go free . but the next time ... the next time sends you away for ' a long , long while ...

you betcha --

consider me gone , detective --

you know my back .

i remember us having made some kind of deal , randall . i do n't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit . i look at you - here - in my town - and i 'm confused ...

get out of here , then . now .

how 's that ?

let them go --

donny --

that 's an after-market alarm . ca n't just cut her wires ...

very good . think you can get in without waking her up -- ?

got it ...

no . that was higgins ... .

peugot convertible ...

for real . okay . gim me columbo ...

there 's no one left ...

it ai n't what you 'd call a `` good sign ''

mother -- !

the photo album . i get nostalgic around this time of year ...

you look good ...

yes , sir -

breakfast brunch -- ?

we 'll take it .

`` carol . '' a 198 mercedes ... she lives in the suburbs ...

thought i 'd go for a ride -

i know . i 've missed you , too

i do n't know . what -- ?

nah .

it 's for assholes . the legal buck blows , memphis . you know that . doing this , we make mad bank , my boys are down , the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze . yeah , sure , you 're gon na get jacked-up every now and then - but ai n't that a small price to pay for never , never-ever , having to say `` paper or plastic ? ''

the family that steals together , deals together ...

shadow games ...

you hear me ?

what are you doing here ?

hey , now -

i can see that -

you 're kind of cultivating a new look .

you sure you 're okay -- ?

hey , kip ...

you know of one -- ?

she does have one thing you do n't .

kip 's not clear yet . we got one more to go --

how is he -- ?

you 're going high-cheese , dude --

stop . what about maserati boy ?

i think so ... they 're just ... so ...

gosh , no . lipstick ? what next ? mascara , blush , floral-print dresses ?

i put the boys on it . they 're clever that way ...

kip took a job . fifty ladies in two weeks . only the two weeks have turned into four days . and not a single lady has been snared .

a distinction worth noting ...

dinosaurs . all of us . the ice age is now ...

what happened to sway ?

you need him ...

and the moral of that story is -- ?

it can be done . take two days to shop ; one to prep . i 'll offer up my bible for a small fee . you also have to hope kip 's jerk-circus did n't undo castlebeck 's linkage so much so that he 's setting up surveillance teams on every city block . and then get yourself a crew ...

i heard rumors you were back . about kip ...

of course . hi , junie --

i can tell you who 's gon na be on duty tonight . i can tell you how much gas they 're using monthly . i can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between `` friends '' and `` seinfeld '' ...

she 's not . carroll shelby tweaked the mustang 's high-performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... but its actual output is closer to 600 ...

no . come on . it was the younger one that was the bad one .

the oldest one . he was in an argument . a lousy ten-dollar card game . the kid pulls out a gun . it goes off . the kid gets killed . the grandmother hears it and finds out he 's been arrested . she has a heart attack . she drops dead right on the spot . now jeannie 's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor .

hey , billy . watch the suit .

billy , how are you ?

right in my face . you looked in my face and you lied .

nods .

i got seared .

oh no ! no ! noooo !

are you fucking nuts ? that was forty , fifty thousand . i need it . i was depending on that money .

fuck jimmy and the money . did n't i tell you i got ta get out of here first . i got ta straighten every- thing out with paulie or i 'm dead .

at least jimmy and mickey want to help . i talk to mickey every day . that 's more than i can say for the rest .

she 's beautiful . look at her . henry , look at her .

do n't worry about it . you listening to me ? now , come on . we got ta go see paulie .

the truth was , that no matter how bad i felt , i was still very attracted to him . why should i give him up to someone else ? why should she win ?

my bag . my bag .

i 'm in construction .

i thought you were going to stand me up . you looked bored . you did n't say anything . what did you expect . tommy was all over me . right ?

who else ? paulie got the okay . this little guinea fuck . someday he 's gon na be a boss . can you believe someday we 'll work for him .

if paulie finds out , we got problems .

jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city . he was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen . hits never bothered him . it was business . but what he really loved to do was steal . i mean , he actually enjoyed it . jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies . he was one of the city 's biggest hijackers . clothes . razor blades . booze . cigarettes . shrimp and lobsters . shrimp and lobsters were the best . they went fast .

marty , please . let me talk to him .

and jimmy 's in it , right ?

my father got a letter from the school . he said the next time he 'll kill me .

what for ? i got a pound of stuff in my jacket i 've been carrying around all day . we got ta start taping it to your leg .

tommy . he . does n't mean anything . forget about it .

i know . i know . but it 'll be okay . do n't worry . i got some money for you . it 's down the block .

ma ! stop ! what do you want me to do ?

that 's important .

we 'll pick it up .

but , paulie , please .

oh , morgan !

suck my cock !

listen , you got somethin ' that none of us have .

yah , but it 's better than this shit . at least you 'd make some nice bank .

some shows are worth the price of admission , partner .

she went to medical school in california .

i did n't get on cathy last night .

you 're fuckin ' good .

next week .

she did n't do it again did she ?

what class ?

you thought we forgot , did n't you ? i know i 'm gettin ' my licks in .

the fuckin ' trooper was so embarrassed he did n't do anything . the fuckin ' guy had been drivin ' around in my uncle 's car all night lookin ' for the house .

i told you , i just got change .

that 's exactly right , will . so the question as i see it is n't `` why should you work for n.s.a . '' it 's `` why should n't you ? ''

so why do you think i should work for the national security agency ?

down there . and i 'm nervous .

where is it touching you ?

with a ramses graph on the binary tree --

well , if something was stolen , i should know about it .

you know , you 're no longer required to come here .

sure , then you 'd have more time to sit around and get drunk . think of how many fights you could have been in by now .

i 'll cancel every meeting right now . i 'll give you a job myself . i just wanted you to see what was out there .

-- this ca n't be right . this is going to be very embarrassing . have you ever considered --

that 's enough .

okay ... do n't forget to get another therapist for next week .

oh , come on ! you 're not pinnin ' this one on me . he left , i wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes . i was havin ' fun .

-- that edge !

this rectangle is subdivided into rectangles . one edge of an inner rectangle is an integer . can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer ?

yes . under two conditions .

fuck do you want ?

i 'm sorry .

who proved the theorem .

no . lambeau okay thank you , timmy .

you 're wrong , sean . i 'm where i am today because i was pushed . and because i learned to push myself !

he wo n't be a failure !

he is at a fragile point . he 's got problems --

hold on !

look , you took one road and i took another . that 's fine .

i been here a couple years .

what do you mean `` he did n't talk ? '' you sat there for an hour ?

you 're from the same neighborhood . south boston .

since nancy died .

good to see you .

who is he ?

i do n't got a crush on her .

i could go for a whopper .

well , i 'm sorry to disappoint you , but i 'm married and i have two children .

yeah , i read your book . `` mike '' had the same problems as `` chad '' the stockbroker .

now you know will , and i know , what you need to be doing . you have a gift .

it 's not your fault .

you want to read it ?

why is it a cop-out ? i do n't see anythin ' wrong with layin ' brick , that 's somebody 's home i 'm buildin ' . or fixin ' somebody 's car , somebody 's gon na get to work the next day 'cause of me . there 's honor in that .

nobody gets what they ask for , will . that 's a cop-out .

i do n't know .

no will , i 'm not kiddin ' you . if i had gone to see that game i 'd be in here talkin ' abouta girl i saw at a bar twenty years ago . and how i always regretted not goin ' over there and talkin ' to her . i do n't regret the eighteen years we were married . i do n't regret givin ' up couseling for six years when she got sick . i do n't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad . and i sure as hell do n't regret missing that damn game .

`` i got ta go see about a girl '' ? what did they say ?

you do n't regret meetin ' your wife ?

you ever think about gettin ' remarried ?

yeah , i went on a date last week .

you 're just a boy . you do n't have the faintest idea what you 're talking about .

time 's up .

watch your mouth .

maybe what mea --

-- well , maybe that means you .

yeah , it did take me a long time .

did you buy all these books retail , or do you send away for like a `` shrink kit '' that comes with all these volumes included ?

take care .

yes , will . i did n't even know that ?

what about your twelve brothers ?

is that what you think --

what ?

not a lick . i look at a piano and i see black and white keys , three pedals and a box of wood . beethoven , mozart , they looked at it and it just made sense to them . they saw a piano and they could play . i could n't paint you a picture , i probably ca n't hit the ball out of fenway park and i ca n't play the piano --

so , do you play the piano ?

have you ever studied organic chemistry ?

rich ? i have an inheritance . it 's two handred and fifty thousand dollars . that 's exactly what it 'll cost me , minus about five hundred bucks , to go all the way through med school . this is what i 'm doing with that money . i could have done anything i wanted . i could have expanded my wardrobe , substantially .

you 're rich . what do you have to worry about ?

then let 's go have some fun .

i could n't wait till tomorrow .

your house must have been a zoo .

well , irish catholic . what do you think ?

you know , nothing special .

no i have n't ...

well , i 'm gon na experiment on you for my anatomy class , then go .

stanford . i 'm leaving in june after i graduate .

is harvard gettin ' all that money ?

i was happy to pay . i inherited the money .

when you think about it , it 's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee .

go on . get in your tent . you do n't know nothin ' .

i do n't know what these cops got to do with it but i do n't like it . an ' these here are our own people , all of 'em . i do n't like this .

you know what i al'ays said : `` tom 'll come bustin ' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence . '' ca n't keep no joad in jail !

not tonight you ca n't . want to walk back ? -- or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back ?

okay . go ahead , but you better keep movin ' .

you never could have kept this from me .

okay ... hold on ...

are you there ?

i figured i could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock .

what 's that ?

bad television .

more like what happened ? what happened , mr. blank ?

that 's it ?

well , let me see ... they tore down the george orwell monument and put up a bust of george michael . main street 's a four-laner , no left turns four to seven . i was married and divorced . and grosse pointe is now officially the new sister city to lower hutt , new zealand . we have fiber-optic town meetings every two months .

it 's nice to see you again .

i just play my own collection .

... i am at home with the me . i am rooted in me , who is on this adventure .

what stuff ?

you know where i live ?

up on the right .

i am part of a network of minds , a group of five people who are all connected , over hundreds , even thousands of miles , through the mind . we can think with each other , think for each other . i can be driving somewhere , sleeping with a woman -- whatever it is -- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else 's mind , far away . running someone else 's brain .

because your problem is you 're bored . and you have a very big mind . i am part of what i call a brain syndicate .

you understand the psychology of the job .

i 'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts .

i guess .

hey , bob .

yup .

why do n't we just do his job then , so we can do our job , and get the fuck out of here .

i wish he 'd do his job already so we could do our job .

lisbon ?

tell them my house exploded .

yes . it 's the same as usual . nothing remarkable about it at all .

do n't forget your identity .

enough ?

there 's nothing to be done about it .

and they want me to make up for it .

tedious . i now authorize you to throw away all personal mail .

... tell them that 's not my problem . i was paid for one job -- the cyclist -- not two . see you tomorrow , marcella .

you do n't have a headache . i have a headache .

nature made him then broke the mold .

when you see debi , tell her i 'm sorry .

that 's good .

i ca n't do this . i ca n't leave you ...

now , listen . i want you to stand on him .

five years . my son was born here .

he 'd be grateful , he 'd take real good care with you .

the answer 's no .

i can handle it !

shit .

you sleeping all right in that house ?

oh , i see , you write both sides of the conversation ?

branding ? i have n't branded in years .

excuse me , with all due respect , but this is her decision , not yours . and i do n't want to waste anybody 's time -- mostly mine .

look , i 'll talk to grace and call you later --

uh , no . i was gon na take a look now .

oh no . she 's here . i brought him along . and my daughter , too . we 're staying at peterson 's ...

i 'll pay you for your fare . i 'll send you to montana first class .

well , you know , however you want to put it -- i got your information from the publisher of the article . i called montana and your sister-in-law , i think , gave me this number . i 'm been hot on your trail you could say because i was hoping you 'd consider coming to new york and taking a look at my daughter 's horse and possibly --

so do you .

what ?

leave me alone ! !

grace , i do n't hate your father .

you ... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much .

well , one was for salad ...

i thought there were too many forks on the table .

why ? there 's no food in the house ?

if i had everything i need , i would n't be going to physical therapy .

i think they call it a pasture .

that 's not true ! whatever problems your father and i are having , have nothing to do with this .

you know what i mean ? is this it now ? is this the way we 're going to be from now on ?

i do n't care .

is that your version of a pep talk ?

okay .

if this magazine is so important to you annie , why are you in montana ?

david ?

where to ?

i have so much to tell you .

hi . um , there does n't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for `` tubab '' who might to have a place for me to stay . are you `` tubab '' ?

i do n't understa-

let 's not talk about that now .

you do n't have to explain . you have every right to come .

good night .

and you think it 's best if i do n't come .

i 'm in charge . i went back very soon after the accident . they did n't expect me for a couple of months . i 'll just take that time now ... i can still oversee things from montana ... take my fax ... my computer ...

about us going someplace warm ... someplace grace 'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses ...

helping all the time ! running to her every time she trips or falls ... anticipating her all the time .

how 's my pregnant chick !

okay . you want me to pick you up ?

well , did you ever think about hiring a business manager ?

you too , diane .

sounds like something tom would say .

delayed shock . or maybe not . i know i could talk my way back if i wanted or ... go to another magazine , someplace ... just not sure if i want to .

but , uh , egypt is , well , it 's like nothing else . it 's like going back in time . i remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age , centuries ago , walking over that same ground , was wondering about or , if they had the same problems as me ... and i felt , connected to ... to time itself , almost . ha , i never realized how hard it was to describe .

i 'll help you with the coffee .

where does this go , diane ?

how 's peterson 's holding up for you ?

it is n't right to make him suffer ...

annie , it 's liz . how 's grace ?

mixed salad .

can we take a look at bronty 's foal when we 're done here , dad ?

well , i 'd like to welcome annie and grace to their first branding ...

you would n't want to dance with me , would you ?

no !

that must have been pretty special .

just follow this . nothing to it . i 'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while . just keep going till you run out of road .

it 's never too soon to start .

not to me . either you want to or you do n't .

what does she do ?

i 'm okay ... i 'm okay .

jude , you okay ?

did you notice -- no cane ?

no , i 'm just not that hungry .

do you want something else , honey ? we order something else ?

do n't be such a baby !

you think it 's cool ?

good . good man . alright , let 's finish up here , and take him in for interrogation .

and never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap ...

the sensitive type .

i want it to have my children !

do you think he could hack a gibson ?

nonononono . truce , you guys . listen , we got a higher purpose here , alright ? a wake up call for the nintendo generation . we demand free access to data , well , it comes with some responsibility . when i was a child , i spake as a child , i understood as a child , i thought as a child , but when i became a man i put away childish things . what ... it 's corinthians i , chapter 13 , verse 11 , no duh . come on .

due to mr. gill 's untimely demise and everything , i guess you two will have to improvise the next round .

up all night again , huh ?

razor and blade .

what 's going on ?

right , and at this rate it ends its run in ...

yeah . risc is good .

it 's too much machine for you .

i said give me time .

what the hell is going on ?

i 'll give it a shot .

think you can do better ?

it 's a little boxy thing , norm , with switches on it ... lets my computer talk to the one there ...

yo , chill man , i 'm talking to venezuela .

my name is the plague .

you think they 're going to bust us ?

i disguised myself as an alabama state trooper and penetrated the fbi ncic .

so what are we supposed to do ?

just one moment .

go !

so you hop on to the next best thing ? i thought you were different from other guys .

just leave me alone and lets forget it .

can i come over after jamie 's asleep ?

i 've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site .

sometime in the night . they probably lost the road in the storm . come down the embankment . it happens .

it 's okay..it 's okay .

oh dear god . its all right ... a bad dream , just a nasty old dream .

how many people in the bus ?

we 're not talking about any ordinary prisoner hoffman ! we are talking about evil on two legs .

shit , earl . it 's ted holster .

i 've got you come on , go down .

i do n't want to .

sure it is . i think tonight brady was ready to make a commitment . but now my future relationship , my engagement , my marriage , my children , your grandchildren , have all been wiped out because i have to baby sit tonight .

your mother used to baby-sit me when i was your age . i bet you did n't know that .

like a real sister ?

no . brady 's working there till 6:00 today .

where are you going ?

let it be earl . let the police handle it .

it is n't a man .

where ever she is , that little girl is in mortal danger .

why ?

thank you .

sheriff meeker , we killed him .

rachel , jamie . thank god !

it 's been totally charted .

that 's not true . here i am .

i doubt that . listen , my mother is letting me use her car . i 'll pick you up . 6:30 .

i do n't want to .

i thought you were gon na get one for me .

that 's great . now you 'll be too drunk to ...

i wonder where they went .

exactly what do you need ?

you 're not coming up with much to prove me wrong .

what do we do ?

well , she 's totally not here .

hi , laurie , what 's up ?

i do n't think so ...

i think you have too much to do tomorrow .

now i want you to change your clothes , tommy . we 're going to take a walk outside .

what is it , laurie ?

tommy , i want you to go back upstairs ...

tommy , let me in !

tommy , halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them . it 's all make believe .

will you read to me ? can we make popcorn ?

you must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot . two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin would n't stop a five-year-old !

i see .

i think we should refer to 'it ' as 'him . '

just try to understand what we 're dealing with here . do n't underestimate it .

what did you use before ?

i ca n't believe it !

oh , yeah .

oh --

but i 'm seeing him .

uh , david called me last night , and he wants to take me to the opera . i did n't know what to say .

okay .

oh , geez , yeah .

the hospital ? what kind of tests ?

mm-hm .

ah , it 's over ! elliot , i mean it . it 's over !

but it has n't been forever .

it 's over , elliot . i do n't know how to make it any clearer . it 's over . i ca n't see you anymore .

o-o-o-okay , lee . okay , okay . you , you , y-you 've said enough . it 's my responsibility now . i will work things out .

what book did you want to buy ? elliot what ? book ?

where are you headed ?

oh , my goodness !

hannah , my head is throbbing . hannah you never want to talk about it . i -- every time i bring it up , you- you change the subject . what is it ? do you -- we 're communicating less and less . you sleep with me less and less .

well , i-i do n't think it 's a very good idea .

oh , mom !

jesus ... jesus !

you know , you 've been very nervous lately .

what 's the problem ?

oh , frederick !

me ?

is n't it enough that i can love you ?

no , thank you .

want some coffee or tea ?

well , i do n't realize it now , i know it all the time , but , but i managed to stick it in the back of my mind ...

you 're just realizing this now ?

mickey , you 're off the hook . you should be celebrating .

but you do n't have any symptoms !

but not you .

ron ... ronny , you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes .

look at this guy .

i know , she ... she really writes good dialogue .

i think we need to eat .

what 's the matter ? what 's the matter with you ? you look pale . you okay ?

i mean , i do n't know , he 's seeing someone else or something , but ...

oh ...

you 've outdone yourself .

i think they 're fantastic .

wow !

football !

oh !

... you know ? i , uh ...

i think he 'll find that satisfying .

yes , she 's lovely , but she does n't have your spark . she knows it . she worships you . she would n't dare get up there on the stage .

now , hannah , that 's not what i meant , you know . uh , yeah , everybody relies on you for so much . `` you 're so giving . it 's not a criticism . we love you . we 're grateful . ''

good .

well-well , like what ?

but what i decided to do is some writing . yeah , i think i 've had it with acting . you know , these meaningless auditions at cattle calls . and i ca n't handle another rejection . now let 's face it here . i got ta , you know , latch on to something in my life . you know -- something with a future . i 'm not sixteen anymore . it 's just ... crazy ! i 've got ... an idea for a story . more than one . and i just need a few months , you know , or , uh , a year even .

yeah , although it 's put an end to the stanislavski catering company . which is why i have to speak to you . and ... you 're gon na get impatient , but ... i have to borrow some more money .

so what 's new ?

no , i did n't , i , that 's no . no , i- i-i , no , i-i just ... hate to see you put yourself in a position where , where you get hurt , you know . you know , you know how you take ...

no , i 'm sorry . no , i did n't mean that . no , i did n't mean that .

well , no ... i-i know , i just , uh ... no , i-i , eh , you know , i , i did n't , i did n't know you sung .

well , i mean , why not ? you know , wh-what have i got to lose ? uh ...

i 've got a singing audition for a broadway musical . of course , i 'll never get it .

well , i think he was dying to open up . it 's so sad . now ... what should i wear to my audition ?

he 's married ...

i do n't know how you 're gon na top that .

when 'd you get here ?

it 's all right .

uh , gee . would you like to have lunch ? uh , uh ...

i am . you-you made my day .

oh , gosh , you really think i can write ?

hmm .

no , i have n't .

well , that 's interesting . wh-what kind of stuff ?

have you ?

... just some stuff . a little of this , a little of that , that 's all .

yeah , it was .

how are you ?

we did n't hit it off .

you know , it 's probably my fault . i 've been a little depressed lately .

i was so bored !

thanks for a swell time .

come on , mickey . come on .

look , ca n't you feel the energy ? it 's tangible energy ! the room 's alive with positive vibrations !

yeah , she knows it , too , 'cause she 's flirting with all the men here .

uh-huh .

and ?

i 'm on the track of a reward , which ...

... you do n't have to think .

no , you 're wrong about verger .

and why is it a vacant exercise ?

... they did it for a lark .

you said `` here 's what < u > they < /u > want you to do . '' are n't you part of them anymore ... ? are n't you part of the fbi ? 'no girl 's allowed , ' or < u > what < /u > ? have you transgressed ... ?

i 'd prefer it ... but it 's just a vacant exercise .

say it in english .

let 's just say they got a passion for collectibles ...

did you ever think , did you think , after he escaped , he would come after you ?

he said , and these were his words , he < u > valued < /u > our time together , because i was civil .

you lasted eight years , as orderly , in dr. lechter 's prison ward .

it 's a poor workman who blames his tools .

to < u > show < /u > ... in my ability to < u > squander < /u > . what one might deem an < u > advantage < /u > ... that my < u > strength < /u > is greater than < u > yours < /u > ...

i hereby acknowledge that ...

what , what , i ca n't hear you ...

that 's right .

how crazy is that .

hey , i 'm fine . whaddizit , you , how 's your day , our gallant international neighbors ... ?

... would you excuse me ... ?

you spend the afternoon in bed ?

ohforgodsake , get on with it .

follow starling , stake out starling . increase the pressure on starling . he will come to her .

he escaped ...

... let 's see the pigs , please .

he turned back into the room . where have we seen it before .

... yes , if you 'll , just step < u > away < /u > ...

he do n't like popcorn .

we 've subpoenaed the auction house 's records .

i ... think ... he was ... . he was < u > touched < /u > , by your reaction . to his appearance .

what would < u > that < /u > be ?

i 've never heard that he ...

agent starling , would you come with me ... ?

no .

a fellow with five fingers .

this just came in , over the transom . fella , works for a plastic surgeon , argentina . look here :

you seen john brigham ... ?

starling , i 've ordered you to shut ...

hey , you know , i never thought of that ...

give it up , evelda .

waal ...

and yet , they are not know for their cuisine .

and how do we account for the interest of such a charming man , an interest in torture ?

sadly , no . and i find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend . what do you think ?

you know america ?

yes , it must be hard to be a policeman . is it hard ? must one , then , be constantly suspicious ?

and you have a new wedding ring on yours ? < u > la vita nuova < /u > ? --

... who say ... ?

yes . franklin , you ca n't live there anymore . with mama and shirly and kittykat . you have to go away .

she 's not the first foster that you 've had . < u > is < /u > she ?

is it necessary to know ?

... they eat the dummy , sir , they eat the < u > man < /u > ... i keep them hungry . when ... when do we think this man arrives .

and i 'm telling you : you wan na throw a birthday party : every kid gets a chance to play , that 's < u > fine < /u > , but ...

you find something objectionable to working in partnership with ... .

... you have to < u > eat < /u > ...

and how did he do that ?

freud , do you know ... ? freud psychoanalyzed patients in one afternoon .

you look lovely .

... which of us is free ... ?

my daddy would say : accept with glee the things you can not change .

i 'm going to do it , and you 're going to catch the bouquet .

fine , thank you , but

they are n't expensive , you got them through your connections ... . speaking of which :

... the purpose of the exercise ... is it because they are < u > expensive < /u > ...

what shape is the scar ?

waal , you hold fast to that thought , as i 'm sure , that 's a `` clue '' ...

i know it well .

or clear your windshield with it .

the great and < u > beautiful < /u > ...

... yes , yes , yes ... .

when ?

but . he was a night < u > watchman < /u > . that 's what he was . n'they brought back , his hat , his < u > badge < /u > , an his < u > timeclock < /u > . n'then they took me off . i < u > saw < /u > ... i saw . clear as day , do you , do they call it a < u > delusion < /u > ? his hat an his badge . clear as day , bulletholes and all .

... why ?

i want to do something < u > positive < /u > ...

i..

... you < u > are < /u > an orphan .

i saw a man today , a man so hideously deformed who 'll spend his life in a hospital bbb ...

... no .

no , i do n't < u > think < /u > so ...

yes . i think i < u > do < /u > . i think it is a phrase you used with that woman . you told her you were an < u > orphan < /u > . you < u > used < /u > , to your mind , your most private fears .

is n't it funny ? you can look on my face which you would grant me , is the most hideous sight you will see in what i hope is a long life . you can look at me . which shows a strength which < u > must < /u > come from strong strong convictions . but you < u > shy < /u > when i say the name of god .

my encounter .

was there a night that i got really drunk and declared that i never loved anyone as much as i loved you ?

eric ... you ca n't be like me . you have to be better . i 'm not the guy you think i am ...

eavesdropping , eh ? hear anything good ?

thanks , talia ... why are you so nice to me ?

this is ... this is ... a very special moment ...

when all else fails , jasper -- gum . even now in these troubled times , ] every child 's drug of choice . ]

do n't worry , i have 33 more days to find just the perfect moment to tell him how i ...

i do n't know what i 'm doing . i know he only likes me as a friend . he 's just so ... everything -- i know he only likes me as a -- but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and i used to be a camp counselor ...

are we allowed to start hating `` wendy '' yet ... '' gee wichita , i guess mosquitoes have always liked me . ''

exactly . when we get into the clearing , i 'll turn on my sexy moves . wichita will go for it or he 'll shoot me down . either way , you come away with knowledge .

you 'll be hiding behind a tree .

what are you doing ?

wendy , do n't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious . the kids do n't understand that this is our summer , too . we should n't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers .

i do n't know about you dickweeds , but i got ta go take a nice , long juicy dump .

man asswipe , you made my enormous cock fall off ...

who wants to go tell the anti-christ to take a `` time-out ? ''

well , the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and i thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow . i think we should discuss --

wendy , i 'll come back later . ] ] wendy ] why does every ten year old know ] what they want to be when they grow ] up , but then as you actually grow ] up , you forget every -- the girls are ] big on `` veterinarian '' this year -- ] i think it could be the `` ballerina '' ] of this century . ]

excuse me , wichita , i ca n't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room . could you ...

it 's okay , there 's a lot of things i do n't believe in ...

do you really not believe in god ?

i think your condescension is even better .

talia 's a rock . she 'll be fine ...

what in the hell did you do that for ?

two billion years of evolution and ] you 're what we 've come up with -- ] `` wichita '' -- the hot , cool , tell-it- ] like-it-is counselor with a dark ] side . ]

i 'm just thinking i 'm glad i broke up with everyone i ever went out with . the swelling is gon na go down , right ?

hey , you 're not settling for the two shots are you ? knock me out girl . it 's the only way .

ronnie !

ronnie , i 'm still a virgin .

i do n't believe it . i 'm winning .

sorry veronica .

i do n't know , it was okay , i guess .

so what was the first day after heather 's suicide like ?

so what was the first week of spring vacation withdrawl like ?

uh-huh .

i made your favorite . spaghetti . lots of oregano .

come on heather . we want another look at today 's lunch .

i 'm sorry , it 's just why ca n't we talk to different kinds of people ?

anyway , i can say never to high school . i 've got david .

god , they wo n't expell him . they 'll just suspend him for a week or something .

color me nauseous .

do n't worry . i 'll ask you to do me a favor . you 'll get the negatives and everything back then .

yeah , she really wants to talk to you .

sure .

what were < u > you < /u > trying to do ? sleep ?

it 's all over , j.d . help me to stop it .

okay , okay . i knew that . i knew that . put your hands on your head .

i knew that loose was too noose ! i mean , noose too loose ! goddamn you !

what in the hell do you think i 'm doing ? taking out her tonsils ?

catch a movie ? miniature golf ?

how do you think mr. kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse ?

did not .

did you miss him completely ?

incredible similarity .

do you take german ?

our love is god . let 's get a slurpee .

what is this shit ?

jason , why do n't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner .

next channel , darling .

well then , i 'll pray for rain .

it 's not perfect . i do n't really like my friends .

my father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up . seen the commerical ? `` bringing every state to a higher state . ''

i think so , man .

goddamn geek !

greate pate , but i 'm going to have to motor if i want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow .

but ms. fleming , it 's just not right .

everyone take their places on the stage ! is n't this thrilling ? !

people just do n't take the name heather seriously . they should , should n't they ?

that 's three things .

wanders out . honora turns to pauline and juliet .

waves a pair of new socks around . the family laughing and talking . pauline is not participating . she is leaning back , looking morose . honora looks at her with concern .

frowns at henry .

yvonne has n't been herself , either . locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing .

pops a couple more potatoes on pauline 's plate . herbert glances at pauline .

look who i 've found !

i had a nasty foreboding feeling at first , but now i realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture .

you may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl , but i have n't !

i just want to be on my own for a while .

we do n't want to tire you out , dear .

gives her a sympathetic look .

i would n't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger !

and so , in a blazing fury , charles runs lancelot trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving deborah free to accept charles 's proposal of marriage !

bye , dad .

yes . . .

this .

him .

saint mario !

daddy says the bible 's a load of bunkum !

i think i 'm dying . . .

of course it matters ! it 's mario !

it does n't matter .

why did n't you tell me sooner ? i would have switched doctors !

what was it ?

did i ever talk about kirsty ?

did i ever talk about the accident ?

eighty third most common .

of course , yes .

what just happened to me anyway ? it looked like a dream but it felt like reality .

as much as he feels like . its a much more pleasurable line of work .

look never mind . just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due . the hills have eyes remember ?

take no offense trevor . i see many patients a day and have an awful memory .

i said she 's been missing for-

do i really want to know what you 're talking about ?

good boy . where 's is it ?

please , gwen . you're- you 're all over me .

what ?

oh my god . it 's coming out .

you 've been cheating on me have n't you ?

no please make yourself at home .

i did read that , yes . what hospital were you going to ? i mean the lodovico street bridge is n't exactly on the way to mercy general .

who the hell are you talking to ?

wow you are out of it .

shh . it 's okay son . there is but one truth . one thing you can be absolutely sure of . and that thing is this :

you can trust me . your wife is dead and you need to move past that . and the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it , not around it . surrender yourself to your wife 's death . let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side . it 's the only way you can become whole again .

if you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room , you knew one of us was in there getting laid .

uh ... sure , tawny ... what ?

last week ...

what 's the big deal ? you decided to pretend you were me . a little moment of weakness , right ? so i sorta swiped her purse . i got feet of clay too , buddy .

what have i done ? i was dirt poor and useless ... but i was honest .

jail ! listen , bubber ... this is crazy . we could fall off of here .

hey , do i look crazy ? i do n't go for that shit ... interviews , media . they 're manipulators . `` keep a low profile , '' that 's my motto .

looks like you live in here , for chrissake !

nah , i fucked it up . i was tryin ' to impress this kid , do n't ask me why . i was gon na rescue his old man , but i could n't find the poor bastard . he musta blew up . i got the hell outta there . i did n't have the nerve to face the kid .

i read the probation report . it 's not good . i think you 're going ... going to prison , mister ... bernie . i know that scares you but..

listen , now that i owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus , how about loaning me twenty for cab fare ?

some of it . right here . i got some of it . i 'll get the rest as soon as i can .

involved ! christ ! she attached my goddamn paycheck ! child support . why do you think i ca n't afford a lawyer ? you know what i mean . why i got a court appointed lawyer instead of a , uh , more experienced ...

you in business with those guys or what ? i would n't want a problem for the establishment , bern .

the thing about kids is , they 're so ... young ! they do n't know nothin ' yet . when you 're a kid , you think you 're gon na grow up an ' be a `` wonderful person '' instead of an asshole , like everybody else .

'cause i 'm up to my ass in shit is why . i 'm broke , plus i got legal problems ... nobody was asking for me , huh ?

out ! i toldja . jesus christ , i got customers waiting ! an ' you were gon na go out like that ? an ' meet the public in stocking-fucking-feet ?

i ...

`` elliot '' ? the heroic goddamn fireman ?

the same thing that always happens ! you blew it ! and this time you broke your son 's heart instead of mine ! he was so proud , looking forward to going to a movie with his father ... and you let him down ! like you let everybody down , always ! what did you do , take a mudbath ?

it 's never your fault , bernie ! never ever ! you screwed up my life , now you 're gon na screw up joey 's life , but you 're never gon na accept responsibility for anyth --

he waited for you three hours !

well , for your child 's sake , show some decency then , rise above your sleazy instincts . you may have already killed him !

well , maybe i would n't lie ... but i could tell the story the way i did just now , so that people could understand that john is even more of a hero , and that you ... you 're the lowest thing that ever crawled . your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail . you wo n't get a cent .

all this is off the record , chucky , because if john bubber lives , mister laplante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more `` misbehavior '' on his part . what 's more he 's going to apologize .

you think i have n't figured it out ? just because the cops are n't on to you yet does n't mean you 're home free . i 'm a veteran reporter . i 've seen your kind before , the underbelly of crime .

how do ya think i got it , for chrissake ? hey , put that thing down . this is my goddamn apartment , you ca n't just ...

how did you acquire this , mister laplante ?

joey !

yeah , my dad 's great . he took me to the zoo .

here . get off here .

it 's not right , gale ...

that 's not what i mean ...

john , i 'm sure she could support just about anything . i think i 'll see you to your room . a sort of bodyguard . make sure no harm comes to you .

you 're a celebrity , john . people are going to want to please you ... or use you ... or both .

laplante !

what 's the matter ?

that too .

she 's talking to him now .

relax , wally . he had the shoe and the shoe checks out .

it 's when you say , `` everybody else cheats why should n't i ? '' but i do n't -- i do n't < u > hate < /u > -- him . i ... loved him once , joey . very much . i just got ... tired . maybe it was n't all his fault . he ... what 's happening ? oh , my god ...

i did n't say i thought we should have saved him..

we could n't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox , but ...

we 're from channel four , yes . we 'd like to find --

reporters ... have to ... rise above their hormones .

reporters do n't have hormones ?

what toys do you have ?

they 're really white .

-- a sense of proportion .

that would be monumentally stupid . all i 'm saying is --

well , we talked about the whole disapproval thing .

when i was a child ... i got used to the closets . the boxes . the cabinet under the kitchen sink ... with that persistent drip . i used to the smell of the boxes . wood . cardboard . i got so i was comfortable there in the dark . even ... even that old refrigerator in the yard . that smelled like rust and decay . it was safe in the boxes . it was when they took me out --

yeah , things are moving along , but she 's still involved with this other guy and it 's a little tricky .

and what about work ? have you had any more thoughts about what you 'd like to be doing now ?

mr. sykes , i think you should go home .

about what ?

yeah , right -- i really have to go to bed .

i was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices .

it 's a living .

do you do washing machines , too ?

`` hi . i 'm mr . edgar ! '' look , mommy , it does n't even hurt him .

holly -- that 's not so .

uh huh .

`` honey , i 'm a zombie , i do n't know whether i 'm coming or going . ''

honey ? how did it go ? you did n't call me .

he wants to see me !

where should i hide the car keys ?

honey , i 'm sorry , i think the vacation will be a good break for both of us . you 'll see .

do you usually pay for charlie ? at `` trattoria < u > valentino < /u > '' ?

all new houses have noises .

did you hear what he said ?

it 's very nice , but it 's still a little pricey for us .

what 's that ?

i hear what you 're saying , but i know what you 're thinking .

oh , space ! -- you said the right thing .

is n't it ?

oh , yes , well , you know , when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first . it 's not like it 's been marked down or anything .

shut up .

and i ca n't help having a cold .

what did the thermometer say ?

all right then , if i have to go to school then i 'd better go .

do you have enough money ?

even better .

am i supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out ?

i asked the state department to check with our embassies and interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank . two weeks ago in london charles redder from the bronx was mugged in hyde park .

this ties in with nash .

really ? i want to make sure that i understand what you 're telling me , greley . a crime was committed in new york city ? that is news .

hey lieutenant , the boys in robbery have something i think you should look at .

yeah -- how 'd you know that ?

cut him loose . the d.a . says you ai n't got shit on this guy .

no -- it is n't . a cop died today and the other is barely holding on . i want some answers , nash .

good evening , lieutenant .

i already told you . i took a walk .

i 'll go first .

no . what am i to do ?

i 've learned that a man can only go so along living alone .

you .

i 'm leaving .

yes .

that 's all ?

are you always this pleasant ? you know what you 're problem is ?

what ?

the days of magic are ending . the world is changing .

you ?

i would like to say goodbye .

sometimes .

the past ?

no -- we 're from strange facts and mysteries . it 's a syndicated show out of..

it will end tonight .

not unless they 're immortal .

-- for three hundred years .

why ? because i do n't give up all my secrets ?

about what ?

then how did he know your name ?

jennifer .

i do n't know anymore .

we 'll see .

i do n't think it is a duplication .

then we should n't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning . this could be a very important find . i want it documented .

just a little . who knows what we 're going to find in there . it could be a huge excavation . a little friendly pr never hurt .

it does not come off as easily as the young ones .

me too .

i 'm glad you 've come home , conner .

i 'll no forget you .

i love you , conner .

do not underestimate the power of your heart . your dreams live there .

what will you do ?

fine .

why wo n't you ever let anyone help you ?

i guess so .

do n't tell anyone what you 're doing , not louise , not the other guys , not the sheriffs . you understand me , larry ?

yes , sir .

mike ! mike , can you hear me ?

what 'd you find out ?

talley .

what do you want to do ?

find out how we can hurt him . by the end of the day , i want to own him .

do n't go rambo and you 'll tell 'm about this on the back nine . i 'm gon na tie you up , then we 're gon na take your car .

that money 's fucked up your brain . talley 's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up , and we 'll all be fuckin ' killed !

that 's crazy , dennis . the cops will see us .

you 've already helped yourself once , dennis ; be smart again . if you save his life , it 'll help when you get to court .

i need you to let me talk to mr. smith .

you 're a funny guy , talley .

fuck that . they 're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away .

mr. kim did n't make it , dennis . he died .

how about your two friends ? you do n't have a man dying in there , do you ?

we had an awful lot of shooting . you need a doctor in there ?

< u > look < /u > at him ! i think he 's dying !

all you 're doing is watching yourself on tv . < u > look < /u > at him .

hey , i 've got a situation here , in case you have n't noticed .

my father needs a doctor . < u > please < /u > .

shut up and sit down . you think someone 's gon na make a house call ?

canyon country .

give me an eta .

i gave the other one to the sheriffs and they 're giving it to the < u > real < /u > fbi . this one 's a fake .

they 're close . let me make a call . you can see they 're okay .

you said they would be here , goddamnit ! where are they ?

i think you got no choice .

fuck that ! you think i 'm crazy ? !

i have your fucking family . do n't forget that .

i know .

he ca n't reach us in here . we 're safe .

better than you getting killed ! do n't touch that gun ! daddy says --

no one 's coming .

now we can do whatever we want .

mars ? what are you doing ?

please get away from me .

another minute . please --

we have a boy on the line . he says he 's thomas smith and he 's calling from the house .

that 's not enough .

go .

i know the one .

did he say if she was shooting at him ?

-- then when you get him , you damn near assault the man in the ambulance ! < u > what < /u > < u > is going on < /u > ?

order your men to stand down .

yes , sir .

the truck is registered to dennis james rooney , white male , twenty-two . he has an agua dulce address .

not until the man calls .

you used to be a cop . all of you used to be cops . i can tell by the way you move .

if i get rooney into the back of the house , can you find the disks without being caught ?

i can get into the den . the office is right across the hall .

i can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house .

what do you want me to do ?

that 's on the second floor . could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you ?

in my room .

this is chief talley . tell me your name , son .

that would be glen howell . he was on his way for the disks .

yes .

i do n't know what you 're talking about .

i ca n't control what happens . the sheriffs are running the scene .

paul , we would like to speak to you in your office .

what happened ?

ten thousand francs for each one .

you heard the tutsi cockroaches murdered our president .

no , paul , they 're afraid . they 've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now .

i ca n't . i have nothing left to bribe with . can your men at the gate hold out for another day ?

i ca n't , i do n't have the men .

congratulations , colonel . you have saved us all .

canadian club ?

paul , i 've sent my soldiers to rescue the lady prime minister , she 'll need a room .

you will tell them the truth .

if you do not help me , you will stay on that list .

you lie .

you can not go back to the hotel . the crazy men are going there now . better to come with me .

when ?

'snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial . lock them all away forever . no political risk , and big publicity . ' that 's what he said . i thought i 'd better tell you .

the high command ? our high command ?

satellites .

what did you overhear ?

business is good at the hotel ?

very soon .

the news room has heard that the french and the belgians are putting together an intervention force .

do n't worry . i have a job this morning . i must go to visit my good friend george rutagunda . you know george ?

they moved you from the diplomat ?

no . but i make cards . would you like me to make you two cards ?

we are to meet mr. rutagunda .

no , it is impossible . that side of town has been destroyed in the fighting . the children are dead .

yes they are . however if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms .

oh , my babies .

we are almost out of water .

get on the truck , tatiana .

you can not go alone .

i have to go out to get food .

but who is left ?

no , odette says he 's in shock .

no answer . please send someone to get them , please .

what are you going to do ? you can not drive them out onto the road . they can stay with me .

where are you hurt , son ?

please . let them stay 'til morning . the militia will not come here , they know you are a hutu with influence .

send them home . we are not the police . what do we have to protect them ?

is every tutsi in the neighborhood here ?

murdered ! by whom ?

simon , next door , the charingas ' boy .

let 's have dinner first .

why ?

sir , gregoire has been taking beers .

the lieutenant wants the register .

he has taken the presidential suite .

paul , do everything you can to buy time . i will call you back .

the french . they supply the rwandan army .

i do not know , sir . i think they will kill us all .

please , papa , i have a secret path .

simon has a new pet . can i go see it ?

-- there 's plenty : for all we know , steven 's got her spying on us right now --

-- price killed her , there 's no other explanation --

easy . you 've got to keep still for a bit , the last thing we need is a coronary .

jesus h. christ !

mr. price ? mrs. price ? somebody ? hello ? ?

melissa !

just for the record : what are the rest of your names ?

nice touch , pritchett : subtle .

new wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia . 19th century , i think : what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane . the vannacutt version was : bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce , it 'd traumatize 'em back to `` normalcy . ''

you 'll never know 'til you walk through that door !

oh , jesus ... .

evelyn , could you just zip it for a moment ? it looks like we 're stuck here 'til morning -- let 's make the best of it .

where did it go ?

for chrissake give me a hand !

what --

it 's okay , everything 's okay now .

-- you lose either way , price --

you 're starting to sound like pritchett .

what the hell good is fixing that gon na get us ?

how you gon na manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome ?

i do n't think so ...

cheer up : before the night 's through , i 'm sure one of us 'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something .

if i had one , evelyn , i think you know who 'd be first and last --

-- i pose you the same question --

what are you talking about ?

really ? well , let it rip .

finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal , is n't it ? the `` o.j . '' knife with the not-quite- retractable blade ? your `` jim jones kool- aid '' that was exactly that ?

what are you talking about ? you think i invited them ?

what ?

messenger just dropped it off . no return address .

first time for everything .

i would n't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded beanie babies had n't tested 100 % safe .

sources have told this reporter that the real reason your park 's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here . comment ?

alright , mr. pritchett , let me just sign the damn thing .

i was upstairs !

i think i 'll do what i damn well please .

sorry .

then who did ? ?

pritchett : what is going on ?

price !

you coming , or are you waiting for blackburn ?

and you think it 's in there ?

believe me , we need to .

why not ?

has n't been a telephone in this house in over 60 years .

what 's going on ?

oh , no .

for the love of god ... .please ... ?

good-bye .

did you find her ? !

why do n't you pass me your plate ?

i 'll be able to do a search , to find out who lived here previously . and who died here .

i do n't understand .

no it wo n't - no it wo n't !

where is she ?

that 's great , honey .

what 's he doing daddy ?

i 'm ok .

are you all right ?

what 's happening !

what are you talking about ?

i 'm fine .

it was in the cellar . weird .

no .

did anyone in your family keep in touch with her ?

white meat will be fine ...

before .

i 'm not sure , but i can check . did the events start before or after you discovered this ?

ok , so we have a ... presence . what do we do about it ?

not at all . i 'm just trying to put together all the evidence , to determine what it could possibly be .

i took pity on the poor woman . this house is too big for one person to live alone in ...

in her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here . she would call me , and i would come by .

did you have dinner , father ? we have plenty .

well what is it !

there 's something in there .

where did you find this ?

and what would you do ?

doc ? ... doc ... hello ?

hello ?

this is his first night on earth . he wants to close the door behind him . like all lieutenants , he covets command . there 's a gateway to hell through which he can be taken back . he has to destroy it .

and why are you back ? why are we here ?

help me pick 'em up , terri . i think the lady just made a sale .

and he still sits there ?

i 'll boil some water .

i figured i 'd make breakfast .

that 's what i 'm trying to tell you ! ...

taken what ?

yes i do . terri , something awful happened to that boy . i have to find out what it was .

great . thanks . you gon na have one ?

you like ... left me a card ? at the club ?

hold on . hold on , please . i need talk to you .

it was off the statue . in the club .

i 'm jp monroe , you stupid little bitch . now get the fuck out of my life .

but you gave me a rose ...

it does n't bother me . i 'm just not interested .

everyday i have my friend rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar . and i award it to a woman of exceptional beauty .

a prize ? for what ?

thank you for the drink . and the rose . wow . that 's ... really nice .

god ? my god was diamond and black light . and i was his dark pope . all that is changed . a terrible beauty is born . with a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes .

you see , we 're not so dissimilar .

a dark star rising . i was bound to another 's system by a soul i once possessed . a friend relieved me of that inconvenience . now i 'm free . born again of blood and desire .

sure . sure . i understand . it 's cool . i mean , we 've got all night .

i do n't think so . not yet . i 'm not ready yet .

terri , listen . why do n't you come here and kiss me ? i mean , it 's probably ticking away in both our minds , right ? is it going to happen ? is n't it going to happen ? let 's get it out of the way . see how we feel . then we can relax . talk . you know .

not now , no . i mean - now that you 're here , it 's like she does n't even exist , you know what i mean ?

yeah , a girl i know helped smarten it up . put her heart and soul into it .

oh , i do n't ...

i 'm a ghost . boo .

`` but we 'll be the same as we started ...

now that 's a lock .

you re not thinking of going to ...

did i miss anything ?

`` a mule is an animal with long funny ears . ''

they record everything their video surveillance takes in ...

do n't wet your diapers . i 'll have to change them . `` witchcraft . '' what 's the running time ?

alex !

but you got three guards who ... shit , what am i doing ? where 's the want ads ? gon na sell some spatulas .

hey , get this irritable guy a cappuccino . i got ta go be a boss .

your timing , and your shoes , are impeccable ... good to see you , alex , been having a lousy day .

that 's the first thing i did . smooch the ground and taste the freedom . sorry i was late . miss anything ?

you 're unemployed , alfie . boss is dead . her plan is over .

yes way .

with all due respect to that great blouse , why did n't i cut out her heart ?

i call them the mtv.i.a . punks think bay of pigs is an herbal tea . they think the cold war involves penguins and ...

snickers , baby , i love you like a brother , but really , who cares ? silencer bomb ...

damn baby , when 's the last time you had a vacation ... jesus , i got ta get out of this job . if my mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-apartheid movement ... .

come on , pierre , steak-bur-ger , fren-n-ch fries . this is france , you got ta have french ... ..

holy sh-h -- things are going to get very interesting , very fast . da vinci would be proud of you .

it 's from the machine . all they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already . we ca n't let that happen .

oh , i 'm so sorry ...

uh ... .old badminton injury .

this is bueno . they had the worst ketchup in prison ... ..uh ...

oh hudson , i was worried you were n't going to drop by ... .

come on , this stuff will knock you out . have you ever had the feeling you were being followed , mr. bond .

anna . anna . anna . if that were true , almond joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the codex . now , get some sleep . kit kat ...

baseball , why ?

if the mario brothers were n't jersey 's third largest family , i 'd say kiss my ass . but considering your status , i 'll say slurp my butt .

or you cut off my thingie . directions even your brother would understand .

we 're here to say , your government was right .

alchemy ! is the business term of the 90 's , my man ! minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago . i dumped some lira into research ... shazam , we come across a diary by one of da vinci 's apprentices detailing la machine de oro , the gold machine for those at home , and the rest is about to become history . money is n't everything , gold is . fuck blue chip stocks ! fuck t-bills ! fuck junk bonds ! i got the real deal ! money will always be paper but gold will always be gold !

i do n't care .

hawkmeister , we got you clothes , great hotel , and a 250,000 lira per diem .

but you 're going to tell us anyway ...

oh ... let 's see . there are organizations that think we wanted the `` sforza '' for reasons other than putting it in the da vinci museum we 're building in vinci . hopefully , these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica . if i seem vague , grand . we want a low profile on this , that 's why i got kaplan and the candy bars involved . i helped george help the mario brothers and gates help get you out ... .

what else do you got under there ... i do n't want to be rude , but this is all pretty lame .

how was i supposed to know they were women ? besides one of them was bald and kept saying `` soitinly . ''

have a seat . good to see you , buddy ol ' pal ...

if you pull this off , i ca n't promise i wo n't kill you . i mean , who we trying to kid ? but i will spare the flying nun here ... .

sure . the kremlin . makes sense . the kremlin . why not ? listen , this is all too indiana jones and the lost city of king tut for me , man . throw me in jail and go ahead , just try and throw alex ...

big girls do n't cry-i-eye .

i ca n't believe this . i 'm in fucking russia , or do i have to say , the fucking soviet union and i 'm shooting a non-bolshevick . i never thought i 'd say `` i 'm just in this job for the money . '' sad . any last immature quips ?

they may be scum , but if i get the da vinci model back , then we 'll be roasting weenies on the beach .

you just might . i 'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it . at the time , i was bald with a beard , no moustache , and i had a different nose , so if you do n't recognize me , i wo n't be offended .

the jerky circle !

i 'm plenty happy !

but then i figured it out : they did it 'cause they figured young norville for an imbecile . like some othuh people ah know .

ten dollars ? let 's grab a highball !

i 'm tellin ' ya , this guy 's just the patsy and i 'm gon na find out what for . there 's a real story , smitty , some kind of plot , a setup , a cabal , a -- oh , and say , did i tell ya ? !

consider this my resignation --

now , amy --

your i --

norville , there really is something i have to tell you --

oh no , amy , pardon me for saying so but i find that very farfetched .

... the people look like ants .

yes , you can get carrot juice or italian coffee , and the people there -- well , none of them quite fit in . you 'd love it -- why do n't you come there with me -- they 're having a marathon poetry reading on new year 's eve . i go every year .

no ! in vidalia ! farm route 17 !

maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance .

... you know ! for kids !

go on , tell the truth ; i trust you and i put a lot of stock in your opinion .

i 'm sure i --

the picture was fine ! it 's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath ! of all the irresponsible ... amy , take this down : dear miss archer . i call you 'miss ' because you seem to have 'missed ' the boat completely on this one ! how on earth would you know whether i 'm an imbecile when you do n't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man ! no , change 'guts ' to 'courage . ' no , make it 'common decency . ' these wild speculations about my intelligence --

oh , no , really , i --

you 're from muncie ? !

mind if i join you ?

i myself --

i do n't know ...

forty-eight years ...

yeah , daddy , that 's a roger , but we do n't sell alcohol .

and what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time ! i 've got a company to run here --

this is the most idiotic thing i 've ever seen in my life !

... what 's your pleasure , buddy ?

huh ? oh , geez , mr. hudsucker , i apologize , there was an awful lot of excitement and i guess i must 've mislaid --

well , frankly , i ...

-- but there 's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --

sir , my leg is on fire !

but , sir !

sir ! they voted me most likely to succeed !

at the muncie college of business administration .

all right , but you did n't excel in your studies ... ?

well , i 'm a college graduate --

you --

she finds him .

that 's nonsense , alma .

at the houmfort .

where ?

i did n't want to frighten you out of your sleep , miss . that 's why i touched you farthest from your heart .

you mean a figurehead .

ti-misery ? what 's that ?

mrs. rand was at the houmfort that night . but there 's nothing wrong with that . she 's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people , to help them .

come , come , do n't tell me how sorry you are that i should meet you this way . i 'm even a little glad that wesley 's difficulty brought us together .

i 've worked with it . i 've seen cures . it is at least a hope .

i do n't know . i prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing , knowing nothing .

but it 's so far away ...

that 's right -- he 's playing the noble husband for you , is n't he ? that wo n't last long .

i wish i had n't heard --

yes .

no . it 's not just how i felt toward jessica . i 've been cruel to even you .

she was beautiful .

you have deliberately endangered mrs. holland 's life . there 's no telling what you may have started with this insanity . why did you do it ?

do n't take it to heart , betsy .

did n't i ? i do n't know . that 's the simple truth of it . i do n't know .

you have helped me . i want you to know i 'm sorry i brought you here . when i thought of a nurse , i thought of someone hard and impersonal .

i often do .

i heard you playing .

i 'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is . i engaged you , miss connell , to take care of my wife , not my brother .

well , i had a good time up to a point .

good morning , miss connell .

i 've never given it much thought .

why should you be ? my wife is a mental case . please keep that in mind , miss connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about zombies .

a figure of st. sebastian .

no . you 're quite wrong . right here 's the seat of the trouble . mrs. holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people . it 's revived all their old superstitions -- zombies -- and that sort of nonsense .

that night , i went to the houmfort . i kept seeing jessica 's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart . the drums seemed to be beating in my head . the chanting -- the lights -- everything blurred together . and then i heard a voice , speaking in a sudden silence . my voice . i was possessed . i said that the woman at fort holland was evil and that the houngan must maker her a zombie .

got a meeting uptown .

ben you know that 's your territory - and i would n't dream to trespass - you 're the expert . hey , how do you think paramount 's gon na do with that blatty novel , what 's it called ? the exorcist ?

paul ? yeah . you think --

ben , i do n't think he wants us here .

we 're not going anywhere .

elena , you 're just getting wound up to get wound up .

well , i 'm really pleased to hear a confession .

elena .

damn it , ben --

what else could i be ? what else could i be ? we 're not living in the real world here . you 're living out some fantasy land from the past , or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts ... there are some hard facts here .

do n't be dim .

no advice from the experts , huh ?

what 's for dessert ?

oh yeah . musk , or something . you like it ?

i 've been thinking , ben , about wendy . i was going to ask if she 'd come with me sometime to meet dr. woolens .

hi dad .

i 'm picking up paul at the station - want to come ?

fascist !

oh . elena wanted to know when we could expect you on thanksgiving . it 's just going to be you this year .

do n't fret , benjie , it 's --

thanks for the advice dave .

a key party ?

nah , that was n't in the contract .

it 'll warm you up .

just bundle up . it 's supposed to freeze tonight . we 'll see you in the morning .

you 're not a psycho !

oh .

-- and god the angry parent , and the spirit the hope of an integrated adult self .

they say you never forget .

moisture ! moisture !

you notice anything with mikey lately ? the kid seemed a little out of it tonight , eh ?

play with the whip .

right . cool . so , how about we take a bath together ?

sure i do , you know , like your aura . that you give off .

out .

where you going ?

yeah ?

i do n't have a girlfriend .

yeah . yours ?

i have plans .

i 'm , uh , in the midst of a moral dilemma . and i was wondering , because i know you 're a very moral person , and --

why do n't you use the phone downstairs ?

charles .

have you ever had a nocturnal emission ?

if it was n't raining we could take him outside and blow him up .

mike 's out -- i think he went to silver meadow to see if you were hanging around there .

the ones you built ?

all my model planes .

did n't want to miss anything .

yes , sir .

just after leland street .

duggar called him ?

who 's that ?

we already did .

guess that 's what they call alaskan hospitality .

actually ...

you did your homework , officer .

we 'll get the other one , though .

where is he ?

what ?

i 'll call him now .

around twelve-thirty .

we say nothing . it goes away . simple as that .

he 's just rattling your cage .

that 's right .

what if someone finds out ?

ran like hell to go to him ...

but she was seeing someone else on the side .

huh ?

she would n't tell me !

i do n't know .

who was kay seeing besides randy stetz ?

long as it 's fun .

what are you doing in this shit-hole town ?

no back-up .

could n't get it up , walter ?

i did n't want to kill her , will .

then so was mine ...

what the hell do you know ?

i gave her things she did n't have . could n't have .

what a pair we are . we deserve each other , do n't we ?

you held sway over them . they feared you . you wanted it to happen .

louis , i ca n't save her . i will only risk losing you -

like moths around the candle of the age . decadent , useless . they ca n't reflect anything . but you do . you reflect its broken heart .

and the vampires of the theatre ?

then god does not exist ...

no .

who made us what we are ?

your lips , they did n't move .

drunk on brandy wine . a thimblefull . i thought of you when i saw them .

oh , claudia , you 've outdone yourself . where did you find them ?

what is it now ? you irritate me ! your very presence irritates me !

why yours alone ? tell me how it was done ! ! ! !

oh god ! i love you still , that 's the torment of it . but you know i must leave you louis ...

love ?

this is monstrous !

you are neither , claudia . now stop this --

louis , look at me .

should we burn him ? bury him ? what would he have liked , louis ?

and he found me with you . i ran , sickened at what i 'd done . then he cut his wrist and fed you from him . i tried to stop him , but you were a vampire then . and have been every night hereafter .

why does he call you that ?

lestat taught you all you need to know about that .

no ... you come back to me louis ...

louis , louis , i gave you the gift -- - help me -- -

why do you do this lestat ?

as did the one who made me .

what have you done to me ? you 've condemned me to hell .

it ca n't be ...

you 've killed louis . and enjoyed it .

you have fed . you were made for this ...

dying ?

no ! ! ! ! !

yes ...

no ...

the same . as you would say today ... bull shit .

well , what a lucky break for me .

saw you in the street outside . you seemed interesting . is this where you live ?

you 'd have to have a lot of tape for my story . i 've had a very unusual life .

sorry . emergencies only .

what can i do for you ?

no way , man . surprise her . she 'll be psyched .

you 'll go away with you 're college friends , but you wo n't go away with me ?

i got work to do . take the bake elsewhere .

is he ?

i know i do n't want to stay in here .

let him go . i believe him .

think about this , julie . what did you actually see ?

yes .

okay , i wo n't .

hello ? hello ?

hey , sorry ... he 's my friend , too . and that ticket is not going to waste .

oh !

he said he 'd try . try is like maybe . try is nothing !

no .

that was heart attack time , karla .

i just wanted your black pants , but i 'm not ready to die for them !

checking the locks again ?

never do that again .

you 're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight , jules .

why are you doing this to me ?

you can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand .

right . planes get hit by lightning . they get hit by meteors . they hit other planes .

i said , this ... do you want a drink ?

what ?

i 'm trying . i really am ... sometimes i do n't even know why i came up here in the first place .

it 's ... the anniversary . that 's what 's going on ... take it easy on yourself .

it just takes time , julie . it 's gon na get better .

you do n't seem fine .

we got ta get out of here . now .

somebody ... is a sick , fingerpainting psycho .

hello ?

you sure you did n't pick up my hair tie ?

pretty cool bar .

where there 's a will , there 's a way . come on .

is there a problem here ?

worse comes to worse , you can stand there and watch me .

julie , is everything cool ? karla said ...

rio de janeiro !

and so could you -- crazy fool .

cool .

tell me this ai n't the bar scene .

yeah , wait right here , it 's the safest place .

you do n't have to be a jerk .

the last day of the season . yeah , we heard .

planter 's punch , singapore sling , or how about a mai-tai ?

well

our friend , poseidon , did n't use it for fishing . he raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves .

it is my home . my name is hugo albrecht .

i just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you .

good winds and bad winds !

no . she shall not be left here .

there was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland -this island was the focal point of their anger . they came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves .

no , that 's thea 's bed . miss wollsten 's bed is in there .

how old is she ?

the general you do n't even know him .

the young man , mr. davis , seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer a correspondent of some sort

you 've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man working at him turning him against thea .

i 'm a woman -- a lonely woman . i have few friends .

woman , what are you doing here ?

no . no . i wo n't believe it . he 's not dead .

i will go with you .

your daughter is ill .

you do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came ?

i shall not leave the island

well , at any rate , i would like to say goodbye to the girl .

i know all you are going to say -i have been saying it to myself , but the thought will not leave my mind . she resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves the way she turns her head .

you know that sound , oliver ?

he hates all my race .

well , tell , him .

i do n't know . everything 's so mixed up --

well , all right . . .

are you running a business or a charity ward ?

get that ladder up here .

who ?

come on , we got to get this up . he 's coming .

how would you like to get a ticket next week ? have n't you any romance in you ?

bert ! thank heaven you 're here !

you know where he lives ?

there is no george bailey . you have no papers , no cards , no driver 's license , no 4-f card , no insurance policy . . .

oh-oh . somebody 's just made it .

no .

you 'll see a lot of strange things from now on .

it is n't me !

i ca n't fly . i have n't got any wings .

your lip 's stopped bleeding , too , george .

oh , you must n't say things like that . you . . . . . . wait a minute . wait a minute . that 's an idea . what do you think ? yeah , that 'll do it . all right . you 've got your wish . you 've never been born .

by letting me help you .

well , who are you , then ?

what are you , a mind reader or something ?

oh , i know all about you . i 've watched you grow up from a little boy .

did he ever marry the girl ? did he ever go exploring ?

it 's a good face . i like it . i like george bailey . tell me , did he ever tell anyone about the pills ?

i want you to take a good look at that face .

poor george . . . sit down .

no , worse . he 's discouraged . at exactly ten-forty-five pm tonight , earth time , that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away god 's greatest gift .

that 's why i came to see you , sir . it 's that clock-maker 's turn again .

looks like we 'll have to send someone down a lot of people are asking for help for a man named george bailey .

get over what ? i do n't take in strangers unless they 're sent here by somebody i know .

oh , mother , mother , please help me . something terrible 's happened to me . i do n't know what it is . something 's happened to everybody . please let me come in . keep me here until i get over it .

fine .

i know i know , but you just go to sleep , and then you can dream about it , and it 'll be a whole garden .

goodbye , sam .

yep .

yeah old joe college wainwright , they call me . well , freshman , looks like you 're going to make it after all .

the last time he come in here . you hear that , nick ?

oh , george .

yes charge .

yes , sir .

i say , maybe you were born older . i suppose you 've decided what you 're going to do when you get out of college .

i thought when we put him on the board of directors , he 'd ease up on us a little bit .

oh . . . me ? oh , well , i feel funny enough already , with all these kids .

say hello to new york for me .

oh , i 'll probably end up down at the library .

this way .

yeah . . . . . . you can take this one off now .

right down here .

not that it makes any difference to me , but why did you come to me ? why do n't you go to sam wainwright and ask him for the money ?

oh , yes , george bailey . whose ship has just come in providing he has brains enough to climb aboard .

you would n't mind living in the nicest house in town , buying your wife a lot of fine clothes , a couple of business trips to new york a year , maybe once in a while europe . you would n't mind that , would you , george ?

you like it ? i 'll send you a box .

just a teensie one ninety-nine , six . she 'll be all right .

lassos the stork ! you mean you . . . what is it , a boy or a girl ?

where are we going ? look at this . there 's the kitty , ernie . here , come on , count it , mary .

have you made up your mind ?

hello , mary . i just happened to be passing by .

come on , tell me .

uh-huh .

too young or too old ?

uh-huh .

you forgot something .

i ca n't wait to get there .

come on , you guys .

i think we 're changing course a little .

bring her to port a little . that 's it -- steady .

someone pop your balloon ?

i hope that 's the cousin .

same as always -- glub-glub , bubble-bubble , stroke-stroke . there sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean .

but the island !

oh , out a ways . maybe the lighthouse .

i do n't know what you did , but that kid stopped . i have n't heard one peep , not one 'breaker breaker ' for days . believe me , it 's a pleasure ... .

it 's either a great white , or another killer whale .

that 's it .

but that 's what we 're here to find out , right ?

come on , let 's check the bite radius .

i know you did ... .

stop that ! we 're not going any place . you love it here . tell me what the hell happened !

that 's great too . gorgeous .

nothing .

door 's locked .

sean 's awake .

can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man ?

maybe they are !

there 's always deaths in these waters that never turn up . are they all shark victims ?

i got a feeling . i have to act on it -- you can understand that , ca n't you ?

that 's what i 'd like to know . lost transmission at cable junction .

if they 're not at the light , look for them . i do n't want them out there . get them back to port !

get him the hell over to amity point , the old lighthouse . right now .

help ! help !

the wind drift is lateral .

i ca n't stop thinking !

damn it . i ca n't understand ! i got ta go , hon .

i 've heard of a white that big , in australia ...

sharks have to keep moving . they can never stop or they 'll suffocate . if water is n't always flowing through them , they 'll die .

brian , he 's coming around !

before , you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade . now you 're helping to nurse it back to life .

philip .

you 're a strange man , mr. hutton .

you look like an orange worm .

like hell !

three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world 's ever known .

i think we can capture it . i 'd like to try .

well then , can you have them jump to the camera over here ?

okay now . have flipper flip or something .

nobody told me .

we got it to live for ten hours . that 's some kind of record .

sean . sean , where are you ?

yeah , tradition 's a bitch , ai n't it ?

i will , old boy , tomorrow . our work is done here . just came to say goodbye , and good luck .

that 's how they do it , you know . seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely . teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw .

yeah , poor bastard .

the doctor said she should be all right ... she 's in shock ... .

they 're at the beach ... .

i have work ... .

no fair , i 'm not armed .

i take out the garbage , because ... i 'm glad we got that straightened out ... .

i thought artists worked with their subconscious ... .

we forgot to stop at the store .

he was such a good-natured kid ... always going out of his way ... .

we will ... we 'll have a lot of time together . what are you going to do now ?

you caught me ... .

he knows what he has to do ... .

michael ! this thing working ?

we do n't want any ... .

no one . nothing . we 've got to get this finished before the tide comes in .

no , no ... it 's too dangerous ... .

thank you ... .

it 's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe .

you just got here ... .

because it would n't occur to you to know why . blushing suits you ... .

i 'll nick the boss ' plane again ... .

a big one ... .

sharks come and go , ellen . people do n't have anything to do with it ... .

i 'm fine .

one time i was flying supplies up the amazon . went down in the jungle ... .

how come it bumps up and down when there 's no road ?

hell , that was n't half bad.. get going ... i 'll keep it busy ... .

when i invited you ...

who grows more beautiful ... .

i knew there was a reason i could afford this . to the woman of my dreams.. who grows more beautiful ... .

cow tipping ?

what ?

hey ..

you got a quiet phone somewhere ?

what about citrine ?

no .. you did n't know that ..

alright , enough , ross . you 'll bring on my `` nervous tick '' ...

alright , she was n't lying about the van . but it could have been < u > any < /u > van ? any little foreign diesel ? .. she 's < u > blind < /u > , bro .. it 's sad .. she 's pro- bably lonely , and you 're a nice guy to have around .. but you 're getting far too far into the element , brother ..

why 's she blind , bro ?

he did n't shoot it , ross . and no way by accident . there 's a flash-burn . it was point-blank .

did i say he did ?

all but .. how < u > you < /u > doing ?

pay me , and i shut up .

do n't start again . if you win a bet , you ca n't keep winning it ..

alright , i did n't , but i nearly did , and if i had i 'd have been right .. i knew there was some- thing about that labrador , that dog was too good to be dead .. we got ta get back up that dump ..

pig woman agreed to take a test .

why do n't you dump the `` fat lady ? ''

what do you mean , ross ?

worrying - clicking - picking - you may as well be back in los angeles .

what do you mean ?

someone bet me a dollar ..

maybe ?

because it 's a ritual you got ta go through with . i 'm down to 10 .

why do n't you throw them all away , and smoke none ?

i already did . what 's his problem ?

yeah , he can go ...

you ai n't talking to no one , till you calm down .

coz i 'm < u > short of men < /u > & ang- elo wo n't do it .. who ever i got free first - < u > you < /u > < u > get < /u > ..

i never asked if he could `` see . '' i just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything ?

is that my punishment for embarrassing mr heineman ?

he < u > has n't < /u > hidden it . he never made a hit this far north before , and he never read a weather forecast .. she 's probably fifteen feet from the highway , three feet under snow .

what do you want me to do , chief ?

what is all this jennifer stuff ?

how do you know her hair 's black ?

week or two . musta been on the ker- osene . stinks like a diesel engine .

he 's offerin you a deal ? why do n't you take it ..

yeah , in and outta frisco on the big boats .. every lead we had went right out to sea .. night , night , freddy t .. john ..

you do n't wan na sit here any more , sweetheart ..

the man who killed amber is a psychopath . he was up at the in- stitute to < u > kill you < /u > - he do n't wan na kill rose - he was there to < u > kill you < /u > - that 's the truth - and i did n't wan na tell it to you - but that 's the reason i want you to stay at margie 's - coz i ca n't protect you here ..

i know you 're trying to help me , but you do n't understand .

i 'm going back to the institute .

why ca n't i stay with you ?

alright , i 'm worried about christmas . i wish i had n't told him i 'd be back ..

you know ? how do you know ?

do you pray ?

i 'm sorry .. i do n't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. i feel like everyone 's looking at me ..

have you been here long ?

d'you have a dog ? seeing eye dog ?

is there anything else you can tell me ? anything about him or her ? does n't matter how small ?

why not ? you heard my voice ?

yes , sir .

why ?

how you doing on those shoes ?

you think john would like it ?

think he still thinks about her . but not like then . then was an obsession .

what was she like ?

i 'm sure he is . but gettin in- to the `` element '' is a bad idea .

tonight i 'm feeling lucky ..

freddy 's new obsession ..

whatta you mean , `` horrible ? ''

i think i found some- thing horrible , sir

did n't hear it .

it 's over --

do n't say it . we 're both ragged out right now .

everything 's on the fucking run ! everything --

it 's a plan -- -- _ 51 .

do n't worry about it -- i never told you what i thought of that memo either --

i 'm sorry . i was on a roll . i meant something else . when do you want to leave ?

still going .

he 's asleep , right ?

yeah , dotty . you did . _ 50 .

i see what you 're saying .

let me think about that . want something to drink ?

oh please . my need to make the best of things , and your need to be what , `` responsible '' ... if one of us does n't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it . why do n't we call this next road trip what it is . a nice long break .

what if it 's true ? `` great at friendship bad at intimacy . '' i mean , come on . it 's the theme of my bachelor film --

will you marry me ?

good night .

what ?

maybe you should call her .

yeah , i did -- am i dressed okay ? i guess i did n't realize we were ...

i 'm relieved you said that .

look , the other night , i want to apologize .

actually he said `` glad . '' _ 85 .

do n't worry about it , boss .

good idea . thank you .

sure --

happy for us ... okay . here 's the number . 404-453-2222 .

it 's all going to work . we 're going to save the world .

it 's all going to work .

i know who y6u are . you 're dorothy boyd . you 're in ... wait ... you 're in accounts . you have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of albert einstein morphed onto shaquille 0 neal 's body .

oh . hi . i work in your office . i was on the junket to the conference . i 'm --

because i 'm worried that you 're putting your faith in this guy who , because of the way things are going , may not have an emotional marble in his head .

look , here 's some of that chicken with salsa too , i warmed it up -- _ 74 .

thank you .

he 's coming over .

if you 'd read what he wrote , you would have left with him too .

no , roy . i 'm not gon na cry .

said who ? sugar ?

not right now , jerry .

you know i do n't do `` contracts . '' but'cha do have my word , and it 's stronger than oak .

it 's either going to be denver or san diego trading up to take him .

oh , thank you .

matt , i came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to smi . but to me --

airight . here 's why you do n't have your ten million dollars yet . you are a paycheck player . you play with your head . not your heart . in your personal life ? heart . but when you get on the field -- _ 113 .

well , friends can tell each other anything , right ? if we have our `` friends '' hats on --

why are you doing this to me , rod ?

oh i know plenty . i was raised by a single mother .

you 're hanging by a very thin thread , dude . and i dig that about you .

fine .

rod , i say this with great respect , but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --

that 's your word ?

maybe you do n't . because it 's not just the money i deserve . it 's not just the `` coin . '' it 's the ...

you 're loving me now , are n't ya ?

yeah . and it might have even worked too .

i came all the way here for that ? to walk the lobby ?

yes .

which they do . and we 're standing there . all the football guys are in the lobby , watching , there 's even an espn crew . so i turn to her and sort of grandly say , `` well , this is me , klutz , asking you , goddess of rock climbing , to marry me . '' and i took out the ring , and i do n't much like big scenes , but she said `` yes '' right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies . we 're getting married in february .

bobbi fallon . bpi . i 'm producing the coke commercials for the playoffs .

`` stay calm ? '' i 'm freakin ...

you ...

you okay ?

it 's in a cage . do not be scared of ...

we 'll go to the zoo sometime . okay ? i think i might have some time on my hands .

let 's go the zoo .

they do , my brother .

shut up ! ! !

oh , my god .

one way to find out .

this is how you make dinosaurs ?

after what you 've seen today , you really think your son could be alive ?

you could n't have made that jump .

paul ! where is he ? can you see him ?

i do n't know . i do n't have it with me .

we ca n't just stop looking . eric and dr. grant are out there somewhere .

eric !

oh , do n't worry about that .

twenty , twenty-fire pounds . i 've been swimming at the y .

we 've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over isla sorna . and we want you to be our guide .

... once-in-a-lifetime .

i thought we were n't suppose to yell .

he 's with a man named ben hildebrand .

how low ?

then we should ...

i know the consequences !

no way . this is lucky . couple years ago some buddies and i went hang gliding off these cliffs in new zealand . updraft sent me right into the side . boom !

they 're here .

it 's a rapid prototyper . i feed in the scan data from the raptor skull , than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints , one layer on top of the other . it 's the future of paleontology .

you think they could talk to each other ?

you remember the sounds they made ?

hmm ?

the lady you called , how do you know she can help us ?

i have a theory that there 's two kinds of boys . those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts .

are you sure ?

any weapons , radios ?

they 'll never make it . i mean , they ca n't manage when the cable goes out .

mr. kirby , trust me , on this island , there is no such thing as safe . we have to get back in this plane ...

what the hell is going on ? what are they doing ?

that 's a very nice offer , mr. kirby , but i 'm afraid i 'm much to busy . if you like i can refer you to a number of highly qualified ...

make a blind here ? wait for the buck to return ?

just a little bit too much , i think .

is there an antidote ?

any damage ?

ian , you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world . i ca n't walk so far and leave no footprints ; die and leave nothing with my name on it . i will not be known only for my failures . and you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic . you 're too smart . you ' e too proud . dr. malcolm . please . this is a chance at redemption . for both of us . there 's no time to equivocate , we must seize it now , before --

john . . .

are you out of your mind ? i still have nightmares , my reputation 's a joke , my leg is shot -- you think i need more of that ?

and let 's forget about the high hide . we ca n't do this kind of work up in a tower , we need to be out in the field , as close to the animals as possible .

not without a shot of the nest .

i 'm fine ... i 'm fine ...

how could you possibly ?

no . richard talked to his parents .

hi , dad .

it 's just fed . it wo n't attack unless it 's threatened . do n't move .

good .

what is ?

i think she 's with sarah !

come on !

i do n't know .

somewhere on this island , there exits the greatest predator that ever lived . and the second greatest predator must take him down .

it 'll still exit if they go on not knowing , wo n't it ?

what 's that ?

no . i 'm quite certain you ca n't .

they will come after me . but i can collect some stool samples , for dna with that , nick 's tapes , and the rest of you to back me up , it should stand when we get back .

where 's kelly ?

we 're talking , my dear , about a calculated risk , which is the only option left to us . we will never find the command nedry used . he covered his tracks far too well , and i think it 's obvious he 's not coming back . so shutting down the system - -

the monitors are failing .

woah , woah , woah , what the hell , what the hell ?

damn !

ladies and gentlemen , last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes . drop what you are doing and leave now .

that 's up to your guy on the boat . seven o'clock tomorrow night , at the east dock . make sure he got it right .

oh , i 'll get 'em all .

sure . i 've got a gas powered jeep . i can drop her at the visitor 's center before i make the boat with the others .

carousel .

fascinating animals , fascinating .

yes , unless they figured out how to open doors .

- - and swallows fresh ones .

- - what happens is that after a while , the stones get smooth , every six weeks , so the animal regurgitates them - -

constantly sick .

ellie , i 've been thinking there 's something about the periodicity does n't had up .

why would they care what we think ?

the cretaceous .

yeah , i know , you know ... kids . you want to have one of those ?

they 're not here .

dino droppings ?

it changed . why ? okay , back over your wrist . because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -

when people try to control things that it 's out of their power - -

no ? non-linear equations ? strange attractions ? dr. sattler , i refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction !

yeah .

in a box under my seat .

hey ! where did you find those things ?

what are we looking for ?

have a heart gentlemen . their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion .

forty-eight hours from now , i 'll be accepting your apologies . now get out of the way . so i can see them !

the full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place ?

take a bite , take a bite . i 'm not letting go .

it 's okay to call them brontosaurs , tim . it 's a great name . it 's a romantic name . it means `` thunder lizard '' .

this is impossible . how am i going ... i ca n't make it . this is ... it 's about fifty feet .

whichever one you are .

fine .

well , i did n't ask . why would n't they be ?

you four are going to have a little company out in the park . spend a little time with our target audience . maybe they 'll help you get the spirit of this place .

ah - - they 're here .

yes , yes , yes , which is why we take extreme precautions . they viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -

let 's get outta here !

no , i 'm sorry , that would n't be possible . we 've just discovered a new skeleton , and - -

john hammond . and i am delighted to finally meet you in person dr grant .

timmy ! do as he says ! timmy ! do as dr. grant says , quick !

do as he says ! the power 's coming back , timmy !

you 're a beautiful big animal .

all night .

it 's safe .

it 's safe ?

dad - - dad - -

but this is nature ! why not give an extinct species a second chance ? ! i mean , condors . condors are on the verge of extinction - - if i 'd created a flock of them on the island , you would n't be saying any of this ! have anything to say at all !

why did n't i build in orlando ?

you 're gon na get electrocuted electrified ! the power 's coming back !

we miss you .

mister biller ... now that we can see the lake , i think we should follow the shoreline to --

mister biller ?

where 's ken ? is he all right ?

this is janet davenport -- i 'm the realtor .

what happened ?

what ?

are you all right ?

alone ... but with a murderous fury inside him ... which led him to kill dozens of people .

what are you doing ?

he was a child killer in the late sixties ... in a town called springwood about eight miles from here . guess what his murder weapon was ? a glove with six-inch blades .

wait a minute . let me see that . she hands him the file .

that did n't sound very convincing .

so , what are you saying ... that he did n't kill all those people ?

oh ?

even the so-called new town is n't so new . only the people . people of the future living in buildings of the past . has anyone seen eduard ?

you look like brothers .

a true friend would do it .

yes .

in a manner of speaking .

the kafka men are famous for it , you know . delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter , picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --

i have n't got the energy . i mean , i have to conserve my energy .

i 've read your stories . they 're fantastic .

no -- i just -- i feel a sense of obligation . he was my friend -- if i can be of any help -- closing his affairs .

i wonder if i might look to see if there 's an address for family -- i thought i 'd like to write to them .

-- yes -- raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps . he was n't here as long as you , so i did n't know him as well -- but i could see the influence he was having . i simply want you to be aware of this because you 'll be happier for it .

-- eduard --

i told you , they 're < u > dead < /u > . it 's finished .

that street down there -- i always used to call it the approach road for suicides . it leads straight down to the bridge and the river .

you do n't believe that .

burgel ! -- i did n't leave it with him .

they 're ubiquitous . what we try to do ... is make them a little less so .

ah -- we 're back to the `` authorities '' you spoke of .

this morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving .

he would have . you were his best friend . a better friend than me .

i was having an affair with eduard . he did n't tell you ?

i 've never seen you here before .

she 's missing . i went to her house and she had n't returned there .

if someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away , would n't they have shut the door as quietly as possible ?

no . he did n't seem to be . do you think he drowned himself ?

well -- other departments are , yes .

your office is the workmen 's --

i ca n't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it

on the contrary , it matters a great deal . we 're engaged in immensely important research here . i 'm a revolutionary too , you know -- but a much more pragmatic one .

of course not . only by a director of the firm . who 'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets ?

once a file 's been sent to the caste , is it possible to recall it for review ?

all these in the last year ?

this is filed incorrectly !

it 's not too bad working here .

oskar .

to be quite honest , mr denham ... i find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible .

i hope it fits ... mrs denham 's a big lady .

can i see the map ? my father spoke of references to a beast god ...

does this look like the `` queen mary '' ? ? we do n't take passengers ! full steam ahead , captain engelhorn !

these are priceless artifacts ! they 're ruining the site !

jesus christ ! how could you do this to him ? how could you do this ?

when this boat finally reaches jakata , i 'll be first off . you 'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day can not come soon enough . i 've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage .

where do i charter a boat ?

man eater ! ! !

what ?

) they are now .

hey ! i thought these things were supposed to be extinct !

an ape ... some kind of ape .

please , if he sees you , he wo n't come !

well she 's not now . i did everything for arlyn . i loved arlyn i took her right into my apartment , my own sweet apartment on first . but she would n't stay off it -- the junk -- and i wept and i pleaded and i held her in my arms - and she started taking things , my things , and selling them for horse . my clothes . we could 've had everything together , everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink !

not young ; he was n't young -- gray at the temples , he -- well actually he looked like you .

yes ?

you think people hate you .

well it 's more than loneliness . hate . people hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know ? i 'm all screwed up .

no .

-- i have to close up now . leave your name and number with his message service , mrs. daniel , and why do n't you just go home and wait until he --

oh no .

now there 's a picture i 'd like you to --

if you 'll let me go i could tell them what --

yes .

you have no idea what i 'm talking about .

they do n't scare me any more .

i do n't think so .

you 're going back ?

with trina .

where 'd you spend last night ?

listen to me : it 's all right . i 've been expecting something .

oh look what he did in them .

oh jesus . oh jesus .

i was wondering what that was .

well , i told him i would n't - uh - go there any more . i know it 's tough to understand , but it was n't easy . you see , he was nice to me . i mean , it was n't just him . i got something out of it too i guess . anyway , i told him i would n't go there anymore .

no . well all right . but you want to and i want you to and we both know it and all right .

oh do n't be all hypocrite . or do you really like other kicks ? is it more just having power over someone ? -- so you do n't really need to --

-- ok ?

look , i 'm sure this 'll amuse you too . ilia trying to get away from all that .

what about the other things you 've reported ? -- -- being followed on the --

but you ca n't say that dumper was tom grunemann .

who ?

what about ?

i 'm meeting a man tomorrow night . he wants to meet me on east-river drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book . can you get that for me pete ?

not tom . whoever it was left a kind of souvenir , i told you , in her clothing . semen . the laboratory got a blood group reading from that . the man was blood type 0 ; tom was an ab .

yeah . it was n't tom .

well as a matter of --

sorry we had to meet here . but i 'm pressed for time .

what 's in it ?

it 's not so bad .

i 'll be sending you on a report tonight .

did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in new york ?

are you closing the case ?

he 's in his room , playing .

tell me , does your daddy ever hit you ?

detroit .

billy , sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced , there 's a discussion about who the child should live with , the mother or the father . now there is a man who is very wise . he 's called a judge . and a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with .

what else was n't there ?

uh , uh . there was no such a thing as burger king .

i do n't know . i had n't thought much about it .

is this really your desk ?

sure . lots of times .

uh huh ?

i hate it .

that 's okay .

c'mon , billy . i 'm trying to work for god 's sake ...

c'mon , there 's not much difference --

billy , do n't eat with your fingers .

uh , huh ...

what if she forgets ?

that 's right . you 're absolutely right ... it 's been a long time since i made french toast .

wow ! french toast , really ?

oh , christ ... ah , yeah ... you want to know why mom 's not here , right ?

does the witness deny the injury took place ?

objection !

yes . very much .

no , i did not .

and would you describe those years as happy ?

my , we are a hot shot are n't we ?

would you describe your husband as an alcoholic ?

in all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way .

yes .

okay ... i think i 'll go talk to my son now . how do i look ?

i 'm not interested , joanna . goodbye .

i 'm sorry ... i just mentioned it in passing . i never thought he 'd use it .

joanna , go be a mother . get married , have kids . do n't get married , have kids . do whatever you want . i do n't give a damn . just leave me out of it -- and leave my baby out of it .

you 've been living here , in the city ?

where are you going ?

i am not ! i 'm a terrible mother ! i 'm an awful mother . i yell at him all the time . i have no patience . no ... no . he 's better off without me . ted , i 've got to go ... i 've got to go .

look , it 's not your fault , okay ? it 's me . it 's my fault -- you just married the wrong person .

i 've paid the rent , the con-ed and the phone bill , so you do n't have to worry about them .

disappointing . it only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum , and ... ah ... they 're not very happy and ... well , the guys have decided they want to ... ah , re-think the entire concept and ... look , i do n't like having to do this , okay ? ... but ... i mean , what i mean is ... ah , i 'm going to have to ... ah , let you go --

all right , jim . you said i was running this show , right ? you said no decisions without my approval , right ? well what the hell is this ? what 's going on , jim ?

hey , ted . c'mon in . i wan na ' talk to you .

i do n't know , jim ...

i 'm going to be okay . the way i see it , joanna 'll come home , it 's just a matter of time .

listen , do n't let it get you down . you 're going to be fine .

listen , ted ... i just want to tell you , when old man schmidt retires next year , i 've got a pretty

kramer ... there 's something i ought to tell you .

now in haskins vs. haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother , thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby .

oh , for god 's sake , kramer . you have got to be the world 's most naive human being . murray has gone in and changed every single ad you 've done on the entire fire and ice campaign . every layout ... every idea ... every single thing , right down the line .

mmmmnph ... i 'll get you a cab ...

yes , what ?

i know ... .i know .

do n't worry . i 'll get the money .

what if i fight it ?

oh , no..

i do n't know , john ... i mean , to be brutally honest , i 'm not so sure what kind of mental shape joanna 's in right now . y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink .

first , there 's no such thing as an open and shut case . especially where custody is involved . got it ?

then you do n't have a choice . have billy at the seventy- fifth street entrance to central park , saturday at ten .

you ever see her talk to the walls ?

do n't worry . i plan to have something within twenty-four hours , john .

i did n't say i 'm going to die , but if i should --

thel , you ever hear from joanna ?

look , i know this is n't gon na make any sense , okay ? i mean forget the logic part ... but i keep thinking if charley really loved me , he would n't have let me divorce him .

three . and add some basil .

y'know something thelma -- you are the typhoid mary of divorce . i mean it . joanna and i never had any trouble until you and charley split up .

then how come she never said anything like that to me ?

yeah , she said it was n't any use talking anymore .

ha ! you tell me .

huh.. .hello ?

kham , holiness .

please , come , holiness .

cow .

and you have horses ? you love horses .

chairman mao can keep china . just give us back tibet .

how much tea do you drink , prime minister ?

we want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed .

yes .

yes , yes . your brothers are here .

two .

at dawn , you were born . one eye was closed , and your sister opened it with her thumb . we gave you the sweet drink .

your father had been very sick .

non-violence means co-operation when it is possible . resistance , when it is not .

the khamba 's gun is his most prized possession . i admire them so . they face a modern , well equipped army , and still , they fight .

the chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war .

ask whatever you will .

i need to know what you know . i am no longer a child .

tell me .

roughly five thousand men .

you have a lot to learn about organization . how to draw out people 's opinions . how to make key decisions . train your young tibetans . when i make contact with you , i want to reach you through a tibetan .

it is too early to implement all the clauses of the seventeen point agreement . we will establish a preparatory committee for the autonomous region of tibet . the pace of reform must meet with the desires of the tibetan people . changes must be made slowly , as you , yourself , judge necessary .

me ?

well , some say . it 's not for you to worry about . another will be chosen .

you decide .

this little brother was terribly sweet . when he died , my mother was so sad . a lama said to her , before the little brother was laid out for burial , take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin . he will come back to you , you will see . so , my mother did this , and a few years later , a new boy was born .

the people will cry when they learn you are gone . but they would all want you safe .

but , surely , we are safe in tibet . we do n't believe in killing .

as you say .

she carried a basket in her arms , a big , heavy basket , and the old monk cautiously approached . she opened her basket and showed what she had . heads . human heads . only the heads .

you are in great danger . the dalai lama can not fall into chinese hands . you must flee .

i remember , too , actually . i was frightened then . i am frightened now .

they think they have convinced me . they think i am on their side . they have allowed me to leave kumbum and come to lhasa believing that i will try to turn you to their ways . if i do not succeed , i am to eliminate you .

good . where is reting rinpoche now ?

the land has stayed in the family . we work together . the nobleman is not too bad .

oh yes . i killed him .

the < u > reason < /u > i lied is if i 'd told you the truth , you 'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you 're doing .

oh , but you < u > have < /u > , ma'am . you lied to us , that could be obstruction of justice . a man 's been killed in part 'cause of your silence , i could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and i 'm sure peta would be annoyed at how you treat your cows .

he 's not gon na hurt < u > me < /u > .

i just have this feeling everything 's totally safe .

forget about him being god , he 's thirty feet long , he < u > is < /u > a miracle of nature , who somehow made his way to maine . this is a grand beast . < u > a < /u > < u > grand < /u > < u > dragon < /u > . an attempt should at least be made to capture him alive .

raincheck .

this is a setback .

i brought a pork chop , maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck .

what i 'm saying is < u > if < /u > it 's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old , it would be unthinkable to destroy him .

what are < u > you < /u > doing ? !

and what would he do come winter ?

i really do n't mean to be discourteous . but how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in new england ?

wait just a second . you do n't just fly in here and start barking orders .

-- < u > who < /u > < u > is < /u > < u > he < /u > ?

and hank . i know you were n't really trying to hit him .

guess i finally got bit .

and how would we neutralize him ?

oh , bullshit .

nothing 's real .

you think ?

y'know , if we did n't live in separate worlds and ...

well ...

he 's through fighting . look at him .

we got ta get to hector ! !

you would n't ?

he 's mooing .

it ca n't work .

you calm down !

really --

you 're mushing it a little around the --

well . goodnight .

why he 's that < u > big < /u > , i do n't know . why he 's < u > here < /u > ... the wetlands are being developed , crocodiles are moving . australia , fiji , the things have started to cross oceans .

i am < u > not < /u > staying on shore .

in maine ?

hector cyr . he 's a rich kook mythology professor . he 's done some work with our museum . he also treks the world to swim with crocodiles .

what ?

hank < u > says < /u > he 's sure .

i 'll take it !

i ca n't . i 'll get hector ! !

other than to eat us ?

so does he .

hank . the little cannon you brought , get it . guard the shoreline . otherwise , we 're done . we made the i.d. , our job is finished .

half mile up , there 's a clearing .

what is she doing < u > now < /u > ? < u > mother < /u > < u > of < /u > < u > god < /u > .

other than feeling slightly embarrassed , i 'm perfectly fine . could you cut me down ?

are you alright ?

you threw it at me ! !

hey ! !

what is with this lake ? it looks black and ... there are no waves or anything .

you 're sort of a rude person .

yes .

yes .

< u > there < /u > ? that 's the morgue .

it has nothing to do with --

i 'm not even a field person .

i 'm not going to maine , i wo n't even go west of forty-third street --

kelly --

yes , well ... famished .

< u > you < /u > ?

i will ... i promise .

sometimes .

nooooo ! you fucking bitch do n't you leave me down here , do n't you - you

what you 're doing , miss starling , is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview , and refusing to share information with me . for the third time !

i understand .

good . then you should be able to remember the rules .

i graduated magna from uva , doctor . it 's not a charm school .

maybe he lives in this , this belvedere , ohio , too ! maybe he saw her every day , and killed her sort of spontaneously . maybe he just meant to ... give her a 7-up and talk about the choir . but then -

okay , mr. yow ...

he 's going to kill her , mr. crawford . this morning , or maybe at noon , but today , and belvedere 's our last chance . i 'm flying there , right now , unless you stop me . you want my id ? here - take it ...

but i just became a private citizen . i can go anywhere i want to .

lecter is still the key , i know he is . whatever he told me about bill is just as good now as it was before .

i 'm 53 , starling . if i found jimmy hoffa on national tv , i 'd still have to retire in two years . it 's not a consideration . but you are ... you 've done enough . if i keep you out of school any longer , you 'll be recycled . cost you six months , at least . i can guarantee you readmission here , but that 's about it . now 's your chance , starling . go back to class . leave bill to me .

are you in trouble over this , mr. crawford ? can senator martin do something to you ?

he 's already offered to help ... what would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for bill ?

the other girls are in the ground . exhumations are upsetting for the families . i 'll do it if i have to , but -

do you recall my instructions to you , starling ? what were they ?

be very careful with hannibal lecter . dr. chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him . do not deviate from them , for any reason . you tell him nothing personal , starling . believe me , you do n't want hannibal lecter inside your head ... just do your job , but never forget what he is .

now . i want your full attention , starling . are you listening to me ?

sometimes you do .

no way . she had a guy , i'da known , believe me . sewing was her life , she was really great at it . poor freddie .

yes ...

on what basis would they reject him ?

billy 's not a real transsexual , but he thinks he is . he tries to be . he 's tried to be a lot of things , i expect .

you 're very frank , clarice . i think - it would be quite something to know you in private life .

oh , a very naughty boy . someone you and jack crawford are most anxious to meet .

because you were n't wasting my time .

why ? do you know something about him ?

you see a lot , dr. lecter . but are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself ? how about it ... ? look at yourself and write down the truth . or maybe you 're afraid to .

it excites him . most serial killers keep some sort of trophies .

no , no , no . you were doing fine , you 'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy , you 'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about miggs , and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire . it wo n't do . it 's stupid and boring .

oh , that 's clever , dr. danielson . very humorous . you like the truth ? try this . he kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off . we do n't want him to do that anymore . if you do n't help me , just as fast as you can , then the justice department is going to ask publicly for a court order , we 'll ask twice a day , just in time for the morning and evening news . and each one of our press conferences will focus on dr. danielson , over at johns hopkins , and how we 're still hoping for his cooperation . and every time there 's any news on the case - when catherine martin floats , when the next one floats , and the next one - why , we 'll just issue another press release about good ol ' dr. danielson , over at johns hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks .

the men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake , build fires and provide every comfort you desire , alice ...

i wo n't sleep tonight . what an adventure ! i absolutely can not wait to return to portman square , having laid eyes upon the full-blooded , red men in the wild !

our father ? did you see my father ?

miss . may i ?

my father sent uncas & i to reverend wheelock 's school when i was ten . so we would know both worlds ... though we were told only bother learning readin ' & arithmetic from yours .

he knew the consequences . and he stayed . are those the actions of a criminal ? ... duncan , do something .

my letter ...

when ? how ?

he knew the penalty for breaking regulations . he ought to pay without sending you to beg .

duncan ... duncan , i promised you an answer . you have complimented me with your persistence and patience ... but the decision i 've come to is i 'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment .

aversion ? no ... `` hatred '' ... `` loathing '' ...

you will have to forego the pleasure of hangin ' me .

head for ... for the white water .

dark haired ...

how far is it , scout ?

... fort william henry .

... and while they are cooped up in your fort , what if the french send war parties to raid their homes ?

got a reason to stay .

tradin ' your skins in castleton ?

no . huron serve no one . the french father believes he fooled magua because he is so proud of his cleverness , he is blind . but it is the huron path that magua walks down , not the french one ... now , les francais , also , fear huron . that is good . when the huron is strong from their fear , we will make the terms of trade with les francais . and we will trade as the white man trades . take land from the abnakes ; fur from the osage , sauk & fox . and make the huron great . over other tribes . no less than the whites , as strong as the whites .

sir ! ... might i inquire if general webb has heard from colonel munro 's daughters ? i was to rendezvous with them in albany and escort them to the fort .

the crown `` negotiating '' the terms of service ?

sir !

i have lived to see two things i never expected . an englishman afraid to support a friend . and a frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage .

this is the signature of webb . and i know the temper of our men . rather than spend the war in a french prison hulk in hudson bay , they 'd fight to the end .

yes .

yengeese major give all property to magua . magua give yengeese major much wampum , many gifts , maybe three , four oxen .

british promises are honored . and the militia will not be released . because i need more definite proof than this man 's word !

chingachgook 's of the same opinion . taken together , that 's gospel . your fort will stand or fall depending on webb and reinforcements , not these colonials ' presence .

many things my french father can not do , magua can .

magua took the hatchet to color it with blood . it is still bright . only when it is red , then it will be buried .

when the grey hair is dead , magua will eat his heart . before he dies magua will put his children under the knife so the grey hair will see his seed is wiped out forever .

honor that is freely accorded to courage , may be refused obstinacy ... these hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and i am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves . is webb really en route and montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before british reinforcements arrive ?

la victoire .

le mot d'ordre ?

be careful with it .

but what about those scales ... or that leech-like thing that bit cobb ?

danakil man ? ... one of our ancestors . named for the danakil alps in ethiopia .

think ! can we stop it ? ! block it up ? ! shut down the line somewhere ? ! think !

it 's got hazy !

the good doctor has n't showed yet .

doc eat already ?

where 's jones ?

what are you doing ?

yeah ... i think they 're just deciding what to do with us .

maybe you 're more one of us than you think ... sir .

that was a loud one was n't it ?

you screw around like that again and --

something wrong , cobb ?

the internal monitors read normal .

wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit ...

twenty minutes ! ... who had tank duty ?

and it killed bo ?

better let the doc take a look at you , after dinner .

i realize you must have gone through hell --

well , according to maritime law , you , as commander of the shack have the authority to dispose of the body . however , the company does n't want you to do that .

how 's the weather for pickup tomorrow ?

do n't thank me , yet , but it is important to know where you 're going and who your friends are ... 'know what i mean ?

i signed-up for the stock option .

i 'm telling you , it 's the suits !

you read russian ?

i ai n't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself .

it 's sixpack !

i feel it , too ... someone 's trying to get out .

i ai n't , goddamnit ... it 's jones ! ..

under there ?

the good doctor signed our death warrant .

oh man , that 's just great ...

how is he ?

`` debbie does dallas '' ... hell , it 's in russian . i ca n't read it ...

hardly .

i am not sure what 's more worrying , the job or your past .

he 's a stroppy sod but he 's got more balls than a golfer , only he does n't know it . ' * cut from completed film .

sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in harry 's stone cold heart .

i 'll think of something , do n't worry .

you want a pint , go to the pub .

yeah , bazza , what ?

you fucking well have to get 'em !

they were . . .

i do n't know what you mean .

er , very nice harry . what 's it for ?

better than good , he is a fucking liability .

you 're doing it for me is all you need to know . you only know that because you need to know .

i have got something for ya . well , for your boy , actually .

yeah , it 's all there , to the pound .

did i say speak ? and it 's mr harry to you . . . now do n't disappoint me and chose your words carefully . you may speak .

jesus christ !

son ?

that should take care of that lot . we are now officially in the money- loaning business , all right , son ?

about twenty minutes .

i am sure you do , but i do n't think you understand ; i am not going to see them or the guns again .

sure is .

yeah ?

we got ta get those guns .

just hold on , i got the keys .

there is no such thing as easy in my experience and , if you think this is going to be easy , you 're a dick . it may be easier than most but it 's not going to be easy .

there 's nothing to worry about , it 's going to be easy .

well enough . i have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years .

so do you know these geezers well ?

and the weed ?

get the sodding gate open now , plank .

yeah invitations , you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it .

invitations .

where did they get those outfits from ? have n't we got some like that , tom ?

this is our money , tom ! . . . now i think we should go .

. . . what ?

he said he thinks we have paid him , and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now .

top of the list of priorities , how nice they look .

it 's pay day , ai n't it ?

i think i would rather just turn them over .

look . go on , look .

that 's fucked it . what do we do now ? no money , no weed ; it 's all been swapped for a pile of corpses .

er , well , twelve .

whatever it 's going on , it 's still enough to send you on a cooking course .

do n't try to con me , amado . you knew how they got all those things .

leave your sister out of it .

if you had your way i would n't have any friends .

thank you , sir .

you 're dismissed , private .

no , sir . they all been real straight with me .

no , sir . not at all .

who 's `` they '' ?

when you were given the opportunity to enlist , a kind of contract was agreed upon . i think the army has honored its part of that agreement .

if the incident happened the way you say it did , there has n't been an infraction .

will this go on my record ?

i 'm very happy to hear that , private . now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for dr. innis and i 'll be feeling okay , too .

i 'm feeling okay --

we 're not running a dating service here .

so is buddy on your short list ?

-- it did n't come out of a cereal box .

skinny ?

i hear they 're closing that post down .

i 'm not picking it up .

`` i only got my little girl now , '' he says , `` she 's my lifeline . '' then he tells me i ca n't be in the box anymore if i ca n't control myself . sonofabitch do n't even watch the damn game , just sits there drinking with his bidness friends , look up at the tv now and then . i do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people .

your mother got a brother -- alphonse --

hey , it 's the general .

no sir .

how 's your room shaping up ?

i thought we already had this out ? next year , if your grades are high enough --

big o was always there with a smile or a loan or a free drink .

dad --

`` mas cerveza por favor . ''

that kind of talk does n't help , sam .

historic occasion , is n't it ?

i got to go see somebody in san antonio today . your memory gets any better , i 'll be back tonight .

okay ? he 's not here ?

hollis probably told you we found charley wade .

and when my father was sheriff ?

i did n't understand the spot i was putting roderick in .

murdered him ?

i 've heard wade was a bit tough on the mexicans --

it could have just been a box lunch from the jail .

so i 've heard --

he was afraid i was going to poison somebody . your father tried to do good for people --

i 'm surprised he bothered with it .

i got a bad stomach . it helps me digest .

harry .

you do n't believe me .

we do n't share our lives the way a lot of people do .

and you do n't ask questions ?

crank call . i 'll get the number changed .

i 'm putting in a new illusion tonight . will you be there ?

i 'd like to hear them .

help me .

was that swann 's idea ?

you rigged the illusion to fail , right ?

no .

are you sure ?

probably .

you could almost pass for a detective , d'amour . i work for the best illusionist in the world .

it 's one in the afternoon .

oh yes . we have to agree what 's real and what 's not . that 's what holds us together .

jennifer 's only ever had one visitor .

yeah . you could say that .

you need an ambulance .

try .

this is where we killed him .

jesus ... what the hell 's going on in there ?

that 's where we 're all going .

he 's better off this way .

is that all ?

i can do a lot of shit , d'amour . but you know that . so i like playing games with people . gives them something to wonder about ...

or murdered , like nix .

why ? so you can fuck my wife ?

yes ! yes !

well , you did n't forget me . i just came because i wanted to know if you knew a man called butterfield .

no .

wait ... you still feel something for that bitch ?

why would i want to ?

i should have been honest with you , right from the start . i was n't born to show people the error of their ways . i was born to murder the world .

and ?

binding you .

you do n't think i 've got it to give ?

ok .

that 'd be great .

around .

do you know where we are ?

where 's your husband ?

you think so ?

it 's bad is n't it ?

i do n't know , i think maybe i broke it ? i knocked into something the other day ...

nice one .

i know , but that 's what you like about me .

that 's too scary .

we established that we have no communication .

yeah ? but look at you .

yeah , you do n't remember ?

i do n't want to go home .

no way .

i know , it 's stupid .

see you later .

how long have you been married ?

fine . is it going ok ?

it 's lydia , your wife .

yeah , i 'll be fine . bye .

ok , whatever you think ... i 'm lost .

i love you , too , good-night , or good- morning .

lydia , i went to this great house tonight , this guy designed and built , you would have loved it .

but i like to ... and i do n't smoke that much .

hair stuff ?

like popcorn ?

ok .

good ... i 'm tired .

how 'd it go today ?

no ! hi ! so great to meet you !

john ! what are you doing here ?

i thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer .

this is the person ... you were talking about ?

says she can get me in to see this killer .

it 's probably trivial .

do you think they have a room here ?

what a ... jerk !

and how would you describe him ?

i 'm gon na go make a stink . sit tight . i 'll make sure you get a change of clothes .

maya , for the last time , i will not tolerate these obsessions .

you were n't there . give me time to get some proof .

would you like to rest , miette ? you must be exhausted .

so , if christ won , that means , what does that mean , father ? that satan ...

what do you mean `` do n't worry ? ''

father , i 'm right here .

i did n't know what else to do ...

how many weeks are you honey/

and his message was `` together , no matter what ? ''

that 's his , i do n't know , his 'grounding ' phrase for me , `` together , no matter what . ''

you have to be experienced to do this . just wait outside . otherwise , you risk killing him .

until it happens , you 're still a human being .

why did n't you just go along with townsend . get rid of me . i would 've ...

no oxygen to the brain .

i know it is . right after my parents died , i went to the beach ... i was in the water . everything was calm . and then one of those really big waves hit me . hard . pulled me straight to the bottom . i struggled and finally ran out of air . if it had n't been for my sister who pulled me out , i would 've drowned . legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me .

you okay ?

i 'll go outside and take a look in the garage .

nothing yet .

peter , i believe your baptism was perverted . look at your certificate . your mother was the only witness to it . your blood-type does n't match who you thought your father was . peter ... i 'm sorry .

peter , your blood-type is ab negative . there 's no way your birth father can be o positive . you father is not who you think he is .

yes .

but i was baptized . and i certainly was n't born of incest .

my parents are dead . do n't even think of bringing them into this .

the good outwitting the bad . it 's like birdson had a split personality .

what ? ! ? !

we need to talk .

on television , you seemed so sure of yourself . if you 're really that confident , you 'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong ?

i murdered my parents , mr. kelson . and while they deserved it , i still went to confession the following sunday .

well , by saying that , you 're acknowledging the existence of a higher power . which , to a narcissist , is impossible .

maya ? what do you mean ?

get out of here .

i plan to . you want a tip ?

as a part of today 's story on the trial of mass murderer george viznick , we welcome peter kelson , author of the current best-seller , vicious intent . thank you for joining us , peter .

how 're you doin ' today ?

what 's the matter with you ?

you 're too old to smoke . wo n't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid .

yeah , look at that sweet face . you 'd never guess he killed nine people . i 'm gon na get my smokes . be right back .

hey ! mr. big shot .

i remember when i was eight years old , you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal . all you 'd let me and lena do was set the table . and i guess you and dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas . and you did n't say anything . you just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge .

that 's not it .

i 'm angry because i want a mother , not martha stewart .

to that stewardess ?

i can manage .

sure . in between all the other things i have to do .

well , that 's what you think , is n't it ? cause i 'd rather wear a jersey than an apron ...

you sure ?

how is she alright looking the way she does ?

are you okay ?

we 've got our final games against oregon and oregon state and i want to shake things up a bit , so i 'm starting you at point again .

i 'd love for him to get a good education . that 's it .

why not ?

four days .

i do n't wan na see that .

what ?

damn , girl .

no one 's forcing her .

that too tight ?

you shoot like a girl .

chances are there 's still a chance .

i would n't know .

it 's better . even though the whole first season my teammates did n't pass to me cause they were mad `` the american '' was making more money . i led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way i could touch the damn ball .

just like that ?

yeah , four years ago . they had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people . i 'm not playing , there was about a thousand goats running around , and it gets dark at four o'clock . then the whack club i 'm on loses three games in a row and i get blamed . so they fire me .

i know .

fuckin ' bullshit is what this is .

so you sat it out , that 's what you did ?

time 's up . thank you for the interview .

yeah .

c'mon , frank . what are you doing ?

this is how you wan na spend the time , then go , go , go -- you 're gon na be surprised at what a waste it is -- `` the most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me , '' chapter three --

-- there 's a lot more important things i 'd like to put myself < u > into < /u > --

well , just trying to figure out who you are , and how you might have become --

i warned you -- i get on a roll ...

i would n't want that to be misunderstood : my enrollment was totally unoffical because i was , sadly , unable to afford tuition up there . but there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes , and they 're names are : macready , horn and langtree among others . i was completely independent financially , and like i said : one sad sack a shit . so what we 're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and i think that 's what most people respond to in `` seduce , '' and at the end of the day ? hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it 's about finding what you can be in this world . defining it . controling it and saying : i will take what is mine . you just happen to get a blow job out of it , then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not ? he.he.he .

where does that name come from ?

right .

why does that sound silly ?

she 's not here , she went out . i 'm sorry . this is all just so , i do n't know what , what to do -- your dad asked me to try and track you down . to get you and i did , i called the number -- do you wan na come in ?

there 's no one in there !

i preffer to stand .

ok. marice why do n't you take a seat for me ?

marcie .

then you 've got nothin ' to worry about .

i am calm .

yes .

you 're making me feel so dirty and shitty . i feel like a big piece of shit right now .

thirty fuckin ' years i 've been with rose , do n't -- y'know -- with this , and i know what you think --

no .

you look great .

i do n't know what i 've done .

no .

but you ca n't say ... .

i think that she thinks i may have molested her .

i 'm asking you . i 'm asking you if you know why clauida will not speak to you ... .please , jimmy ... .tell me .

... say it , jimmy ...

i love you so much .

i 'm not mad . i am , but i 'm not . y'know ?

it 's over becuase ... for all the the right reasons i hope , what i said .

yes .

it 's not really pain .

it 'll take the pain away .

it 's alright .

no , i 'm just a friend . what are you doing here , i mean ... you know claudia ?

you have to go , stanley . you 're the smartest .

no they do n't --

commercials , a sitcom , an mow or something .

no .

do you have an agent , stanley ?

now you must really shut the fuck up , please . shut the fuck up .

i 'm trying to help , linda --

the money would go to frank . the court would put the money in the hands of a relative --

i ca n't .

are you on drugs right now ?

no ... i just ... i 'm so fucked up here alan , i do n't know ... there 's so much ... so many things --

-- what-what-what , ma'am -- i --

you been on prozac long ? dexadrine ?

yes . what ? yes .

mmm.hmm .

cigarettes . camel lights .

shut up -- shut up --

i said i 'm fine .

stand up .

-- talk in the car , talk in the car , moves your ass , c'mon --

this happens ... .this is something that happens .

i can take you to get money . i do n't need it ... i do n't < u > need < /u > it -- listen to me : i can let you have money so your father wo n't hit you ever again -- you 'll have the money because i do n't need it .

i have money to give you .

it 's ok .

what -- ?

i am king , mother ! and i do not wish to discuss this with you .

shut up , knave !

wh -- wha --

your birthday celebration , your majesty ?

remember , phillippe ... nobility is born in the heart .

poor phillippe !

three days ? ? ! !

more wine ! !

you are not my priest , aramis ! you would not be , even if i had one .

come , we have a boat waiting .

it can . i know the way .

pull them back , d'artagnan .

the secret i carry i can not share . not even with god .

he is right , d'artagnan .

the child of the king is ... the king . louis !

it is a weighty problem , aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret general of the jesuits , whoever he might be .

jesus of nazareth found the holy among the profane . if we are to have a place of private prayer , where better than here , beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river ?

aramis ... is this the way to hell ?

ca n't you see i 'm praying , goddammit ? !

you are right . but it is a trap .

i do n't know about you , but i plan to wait here .

it is already done . i have just stopped at mother 's grave , to say goodbye , before coming to tell you .

no man is all bad ... or all good . i believe -- i must believe -- that louis can learn . and perhaps i can help him .

where are you going ?

d'artagnan !

i 've worn this mask so long , i could n't sleep without it .

it is something i have done -- or did not do .

there is ... wrath ... in me . i have learned to hide it . those years in the cell , i dreamed that freedom would someday just happen , the way the mask happened . now i am free . and with each free breath i feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all i lost . look at this , all this that for ten years i could not see ! what if i become a king -- a king no different from my brother ?

aramis , porthos and athos too . i know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed , with no harm coming to your majesty . if their passions were in error , their spirits have ever been noble . forgive them .

your majesty ... this man before you ... he is royal blood , the same as you . to spill it is the one thing even you can not do . it is against the laws of god , and of france .

my twin . which has kept him alive . until now .

silence ! i order you !

that is enough ! you are a good servant , d'artagnan , but you forget your place !

what quaint notions , d'artagnan ! but they contradict my father , who picked his queen when he was old , and only then to bear me .

a personal nature ?

i am king , d'artagnan . i will change my mind as i wish , and i will enjoy my banquet as i wish !

the plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me .

i would not have disturbed you , majesty , but you ordered me to keep you informed --

ah yes , the riots . we have food stocks on the wharves right now , no ?

did you know ... about raoul ?

no , you may wait behind the screen .

i ... we are humble people ...

what can i do for you ?

he walked in on fleming and took him out .

well do n't you think that 's odd ?

yeah ...

fine ...

so ? girls left bars with ted bundy too . it does n't rule out foul play .

what the hell is this marvosa ! !

oh for chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of --

bullshit ...

are you alright ?

anyhow ... you wake up and she 's gone . but -- -- this is my favorite part -- she leaves you the keys to a brand new beemer .

well let 's get his ass to the garage ! some lead ...

zydowski . it 's about time .

speak of the devil .

i got out of there . i just grabbed up my stuff , and then i found it .

ahh , shit . we 're pretty much tapped out . i 'm getting denied access all over the place ...

ok , i 'm logged on to the municipal network . i 'm showing sixteen people with the name sarah williams in l.a. county . none of them live in hollywood . do you remember the address ?

it was self-defense , tubbs ! they 're dirty ! i walked in on something , i do n't know what -

tubbs , it 's me .

screw him !

are you serious ? my boyfriend ditched me ...

are you a regular there ?

i asked him not to tell me where he was going . i told him i do n't want any part of it .

long gone ... marvosa well you wo n't mind if i do n't take your word for it , right ?

do n't you guys ever knock ?

that was peterson upstairs .

the chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the tattler right now .

'dear pilgrim , you honor me . '

you would n't like it , either if you had it .

i have to .

there has to be .

and if we pull it , we lose a week ... we only have two to the next full moon .

twenty-five minutes . we wo n't make it in time .

... there 's three 't 's ' and an ' r ' in tattler .

we know the tooth fairy reads the tattler . the stuff about me and lector ? i do n't know any other paper that carried it ...

is it weird ?

atlanta and birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders . five will get you ten they do n't come up with an identification . jimmie may in the finder program ... if he 's ever been printed and in his index .

let 's talk after dinner . stay and eat .

i am all right .

you look all right now .

i think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way i think . i came down here to get away from all that .

you do n't need me . i would n't be useful to you anymore , jack .

i should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work . you do n't want to talk about it here ...

the tooth ...

am i alone in this room ? are you here ... why are you doing this ? !

me .

who is it ?

the developing room . i need to ... see you .

do you want a coke or something , reba ?

i 'll get it . stay right here . you look very good in the sun ...

i have work to do at the plant .

they had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract .

in the kitchen .

ride with me .

when do you need it ?

shut up . stop . stop it .

do you imply that i 'm a queer ?

'no ' what ?

in a little while i 'll help you understand .

do you pray to god , mr. lounds ?

let me lie down . listen , i want to call my office . my god , i 'm in a stryker frame . my back 's broken . tell me the truth .

where did you get it ? !

we 're looking for graham . the man the book is supposed to go to is a mr. will graham .

i do n't want to do that ,

why do you think i called ?

you remember when we first met ? and were together alone in that room . and the exhilaration was too much to hold on to . and then something flickered across your face like a shadow and i asked you what was wrong ?

will you be in atlanta for a while ? i 'm not buggin ' you about coming home , i just wondered .

tell me about yourself .

me , too . and very erotic ...

huh ? will ? is that you ?

it 's will graham . is molly there , mr. swenson ?

there 's a vtr setup waiting in your hotel room , that you asked for . they transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch vhs .

i told my dad before he died , i 'd take care of mom . and i 'll do it . this guy wants to kill you ?

i figured i 'd ask you ...

you should , will . god 's terrific ! he dropped a church roof on thirty- four of his worshippers in texas last wednesday night . just as they were groveling to him and singing a hymn . do n't you think that felt good ? he would n't begrudge you two measly murders .

fight what ?

what do you want ?

you have n't threatened to take away my books yet .

do you have the file with you

then how did you catch me , will ?

yes , i thought so .

it does n't matter to me , will .

let 's walk the route .

... commercially prohibited . number twelve shot in liquid teflon in a copper casing . on impact it all opens up in the target . expect the recoil . they 're hot loads . body armor ?

glaser safety slugs ?

i 'm gon na spray your suit jackets . it 'll be invisible in this light , but you 'll stand out like a zebra for us . they told me you checked out a .44 charter arms bulldog .

yeah ...

so how can i help you ... ?

of course ! but that does n't mean i do n't need everyone 's support ! i ca n't be surrounded by negative energy .

it 's visualization therapy . he 's helping me turn inward and fight the disease .

what was that all about ?

are you makin ' fun of me -- ? this is ridiculous !

no to the whole thing . none of it sounds good .

i 'm -- fonzie ? george no ! the fonzie ! the crazy breakout character ! the guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes !

sitcom ... ?

so i understand you 're from lithuania ?

so , mr. besserman , same slot tomorrow ... ?

b-but ... we saw ... your neck ...

b-but i have them .

okay , great ! so let 's reset !

deal .

i do n't deserve haagen daz . i 'm a horrible person .

why did you call me ? the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you .

i really want one . one large tub of popcorn , please , extra butter .

popcorn ?

hi ... am i late ?

hi ...

no ! no no no ! none of that ! i want this show to be positive !

what is this , world war two ... ?

`` was this in actuality andy kaufman ? and if it was andy kaufman , is andy kaufman crazy ? ''

nah . the girls sponge off between johns .

are you nuts ? ! 40 million people watch you every week !

why ? ? i ... i attend every year .

this is very difficult for me to say ... but -- perhaps it would be best if you did n't attend the retreat .

yes , your holiness ?

doctor , i think i need a neck brace .

eh , sure . we 're trying to expand our audience base -- and i know the college kids really love andy kaufman .

i do n't know what yer talkin ' about . you musta talked to someone else --

yeah ! you stay away from that andy kaufman , if you know what 's good for you !

i used to think you were original .

you do n't know .

he 'll be contacting us again .

all the time . it 's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly .

right ...

but you 're out , cypher . you ca n't go back .

he had an accident .

five . since i 've been here .

is that ... ?

i do n't believe it ! i do n't believe it !

give me your phone .

i got a fibrillation !

yes .

morpheus , the oracle ... she told me --

trinity ! go ! get to the basement . find the catch basin !

no . no ! morpheus ! do n't !

listen to me , neo . i know why you 're afraid to go through that door . you ca n't get free of thinking that i could be wrong . you must believe me . there is a greatness inside of you , neo . a greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world .

did you believe in them too ?

so is this the same oracle that made the , uh , prophecy ?

i know what you 're trying to do --

this ca n't be ...

i know exactly what you mean .

welcome , neo . as you no doubt have guessed , i am morpheus .

but what if ... ?

what the fuck do they want with me ? !

he is the one . he is the one !

goddamn ! it 's good to hear your voice , sir !

tank .

now left and that 's it in front of you .

you 're going to have to make a final choice . in one hand , you will have morpheus ' life . in the other hand , you will have your own . one of you is going to die . which one , will be up to you .

that vase .

bingo . not quite what you were expecting , right ? i got to say i love seeing you non-believers . always a pip . almost done . smell good , do n't they ?

because ...

that i would have to make a choice ...

what happened ?

what does that mean ?

i used to eat there ... really good noodles .

because you 've been down there , neo . you already know that road . you know exactly where it ends .

they 're watching you , neo .

how did you do that ?

hello , neo .

they inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems . it 's like cracking a computer . all it takes is time .

it 's a city ?

they 've burned through the outer shields .

i ca n't !

what are your plans ?

riverdale .

ok. for another $ 5.00 a special on the packs .

uh ... can we give you a check ?

thanks for the ride .

ok ... but go to a movie first or something ... not good to be driving around right away . you know you ca n't do much for him now ... it 's out of your hands .

jewish ...

'thou sayest it ; i am a king . this is why i was born and why i have come into this world , to bear witness to the truth . everyone who is of the truth hears my voice . '

'my kingdom is not of this world . if my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that i might not be delivered to the jews . but , as it is my kingdom is not from here . '

'and with your spirit . '

no .

look who 's talking . pretentious bullshit . who 's the guy with william blake and the tigers , eh ?

i 'll be here . do n't worry .

yeah , take it easy . will you relax .

no ... his business is bad . but i 'll decide what to do and you ... and you just keep out of anything that might ... might ... er draw attention to you .

oh , that 's ok ... i 've been in and out of this place fifty times .

why do n't you take a look around the place if you want ?

it 's only a couple of courses ... just for the draft .

it was nothing . i 'm almost finished .

not sick ... just stupid . speaking of stupid , your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother 's house ... to get some food .

charlie ... ?

well ... with the hotel that 's ten ... fifteen ...

lower the fuckin music -- i ca n't hear nothin .

we 'll close up as soon as everybody leaves .

quiet please .

shut up .

you what ?

not bad . $ 20 . here , $ 5 .

... we 're never all together two nights in a row . maybe christmas , thanksgiving , that 's it . what 's going on ?

you ate ?

he 's coming .

i do n't like cake .

whatever it was , they 'll be here . we sent out invitations to everyone , plane tickets included -- the rsvp 's are amazing . a few of them we did n't hear from , and some of them are dead , of course --

did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming ?

we 've got some things to discuss .

now , i 'm getting interested . i want to know more -- -

is n't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it .

not much more . big day in the big city . what 's on your mind ?

pinot grigio . we 're considering it for the appetizer .

bill , thanks for coming over ... and how 're you doing today , drew ? you 've got a firecracker here , the kid 's really set the table .

right away .

you mean this , sir ?

well ... goodnight .

... see you tomorrow night .

perhaps you could remind me .

nice to see you . i did n't expect you , but certainly you ca n't get enough of a good thing .

mandatory retirement upon our chairman 's sixty-fifth birthday .

yes , you are to understand that , and now may i ask you a question ?

i 'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me .

i have to go , bill -- it 's been a helluva day . need a few minutes to sort everything out .

as much as joe 's ?

how nice for you both .

no .

what do you mean ?

i 'm all excited --

well , i 'm happy to tell you i 've got good news . as i was telling drew , i 've been making a little hay while the bontecou sun was shining -- two , possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger .

you 're on , quin-cee . destination hospital . joe , you 'll be the tour guide . okay ? how 's that sound to you ?

yeah .

you loved back ?

yes .

oh , you come to see doctor lady ?

doctor lady make it irey .

obeah evil . i not evil .

what would you say if you knew it was me who brought down bill parrish ? i told drew and the board that bill depended on you . drew led me on , but i had no business telling him in the first place . he was setting up bill from day one . drew and bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts . bontecou was outside , drew was mr. inside . and i was the fool who made it all happen . oh god , what do i do ?

oh yes , you are one of my favorites .

you 're an original , joe . a little hard to figure , maybe ...

hold me --

the 'coffee shop ' --

'love will find out the way ' .

do n't . that will come later .

but there 's so much to tell you --

i loved it .

almost .

where are you going ?

i appreciate you --

joe --

yes -- ?

i 've got plenty of friends .

not the one i met this morning , hit- ting on me in as nice a way as i 've been hit on in a long time , but the moment you find out i 'm my dad 's daughter , you act like a stranger .

i told you to shut up .

well , they 're mine now .

which is what ?

what the hell do you care ?

good . tomorrow , after the party .

you 're violating the laws of the universe .

i 'll be the judge of that .

what 's okay ?

i do n't want anybody buying up my life 's work and turning it into something it was n't meant to be . a man wants to leave something behind . and he wants it left behind the way he made it . and he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor , of dedication , of truth . okay ?

why did n't you stop me ?

no thank you , bill . i can manage .

yes , i am . there 's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor . why do n't you go down and read some magazines ?

-- what 's the deal here ? are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end ?

that 's what everybody says .

you were hatching ideas , making plans , arriving at decisions , right ?

what do you mean ?

a 'deal ' ?

your doctor ? did your doctor say anything about a tiny , undetectable hole in your aorta ? did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain ? were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in gstaad ?

if there is anything else , do n't hesitate --

thank you .

then do n't .

and then -- ?

watch it !

'yes ' what ?

no , anything is possible . it 's up to joe .

... i read you all the way on the bontecou thing , and i know where you 're coming from . and i 'm with you a hundred and one percent .

i appreciate this , eddie , members of the board , this will just take a minute of your time . as the custo- dians of the company , you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you -- -- or not . either way , thanks .

okay , eddie -- anyway , thanks for the memory .

why do n't we let it rest for the moment ? give it some air ?

daddy --

in this case , i ca n't . i - uh -- i just ca n't help you . i only would tell you -- that with joe , you are on very , very dangerous ground .

where is he ?

where 's joe ?

now we love drew and joe in verbo- ten ? what 's going on ?

will it ? ...

well , go get 'em , pops .

what is it , daddy -- ?

daddy , what 's the matter ?

thank god .

i know . but i 'm the only father you 've got .

did i say something wrong ?

i would .

'pro bono ' . that means doing good -- going to be doing good all your life ?

... it 's kind of a pro bono job .

and i want to get into my apartment and go to work . please , what do you say , another cup of coffee ?

-- this is my lucky day . i arrive in this big bad city and i not only find a doctor , a beautiful woman as well .

i 'm sorry --

you and 'honey ' ?

oh yeah ? what was 'fascinating ' about it ?

it 's not your fault . see , you have this condition ...

because you 're relying on them alone . you do n't remember what you 've discovered or how . your notes might be unreliable .

30 .

and he says you 're gon na wan na hear what he 's got to say . *

you do n't have to be that honest , burt .

this is n't your room . you 're in 304. i fucked up .

what makes you think he 's my friend ?

how long have i been here ?

my wife .

you said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them . do n't you remember ?

burt .

jimmy ?

you have no idea where you 've just come from ? what you 've just done ?

you pathetic piece of shit . i can say whatever the fuck i want and you wo n't have a clue , you fucking retard .

what happened is that jimmy went to meet a guy called teddy . he took a lot of money with him and he did n't come back . jimmy 's partners think i set him up . i do n't know whether you know this teddy or how well -

my wife used to call me lenny .

i did exactly what you told me . i went to * dodd and i said that i did n't have * jimmy 's money , or any drugs , that this teddy must have taken everything .

just relax .

kill him .

so i just take your word ?

sleep okay ?

i wrote an address in there , too . might be useful . it 's this abandoned place outside of town . i guy i know used to use it for his bigger deals .

* so i 'll take a picture , get a tattoo . * * the world does n't disappear when you * close your eyes , does it ? my actions * still have meaning , even if i can't * remember them . my wife deserves * vengeance , and it does n't make any * difference whether i know about it . *

yes .

she seemed to leave happy . i thought i 'd helped her .

yeah , but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -

i enjoy it .

how can you read that again ?

my mother calls me teddy . i 'm john edward gammell . cheer up , there 's a lot of john * g 's for us to find . all you do is moan . * i 'm the one that has to live with what * you 've done . i 'm the one that has to put * it all together . you just wander around * playing detective . you 're living a dream , * kid . a dead wife to pine for and a sense * of purpose to your life . a romantic quest * which you would n't end even if i wasn't * in the picture . *

you wo n't remember !

no , you wo n't .

i guess i can only make you believe the things you want to be true , huh ? like ol' * jimmy down there .

my wife was n't diabetic .

i 'm a snitch . he 's a cop from out of town looking for information . the local boys put us in touch .

envelopes ? *

yes , i do . i do n't have amnesia . i remember everything about myself up until the incident . i 'm leonard shelby , i 'm from san fran -

i have money .

she 's involved with these drug dealers .

why 's that ?

you like it ? let 's trade .

he 's got to have a car , right ? we just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him .

i might have fallen asleep before i did .

why ?

yeah , well i go on facts , not recommendations , okay ?

well , the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up . get you to kill the wrong guy .

unfinished business . what made you think i was n't coming back ?

lenny , is that you ?

mr gammell ?

fuck you ; i gave you a reason to live and * you were more than happy to help . you lie * to yourself ! you do n't want the truth , * the truth is a fucking coward . so you * make up your own truth . *

his name 's james f. grantz , john g. check * your tattoos . *

lemon or lime ?

sure .

you need to consider a few issues .

tell them what you want .

make it 40 % .

what are you going to do with me ? are you taking me to jail ? you think i will turn into your informant , is that it ?

and we did n't come down here to audition . business auditions for us ... ... and know who we are and know they want their load run by us < u > before < /u > nicholas calls .

something 's wrong .

skin has to touch skin . that 's the requirement for the warrant . then he makes a credible excuse and he stops ... . her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security ...

never heard of him .

... so there 's < u > no < /u > industrial- strength hrt weapons team out there tonight ?

i mean new york 's one thing , but can you see this guy , imagine it , running around the goddam beach all suntan and he 's going in swimming , like , and then somebody yells 'hey , ratso ' -- how does that sound to you ?

keep the goddam blanket on .

you get your first palm tree in south carolina .

i do n't even want you to go . whaddya think of that ? i got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he 's god 's gift to women . one twenty-buck trick and he 's already the biggest stud in new york city . it 's laughable .

and what ?

the name 's rico , at my own father 's grave , a man deserves some respect .

kee-rist , you sure are one twisty little bastard , ratso .

where 'd that come from ?

shee-it . cough yourself inside out , then light a fag , a goddam fag . you make me puke . where 'd you steal it ? in the movies ?

oh jesus !

same . none of the neighbors know . we told them you were in a hospital in europe . oh ... this is stanley davis . he 's the american consul here ... and necdit yesil , the lawyer you wanted ...

about ten kilometers .

would you recognize him again ?

no , i 'm not afraid .

be tough on 'em .

... are you with the consulate ?

you decided to fly at a bad time billy palestinian guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all .

it 's not fair !

hashish . ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish .

i 'm billy hayes ... at least i used to be .

'dem dat hides can finds says i ' ... i seen him , the clever tit , sneaking looks at it late at night , talking to it .

those things bring juice to the new stations . you just ca n't rewire that shit ...

oh , that 's gon na work .

right . hardwired to eat anything that 's not like them !

his blood ! it 's driving them crazy ! we have to mask the odor !

that 's camouflage ...

you said that thing was big as your hand . i do n't think i 'm going to miss ...

maybe they lied to you .

we ?

this thing was the size of my fist , peter ! ! that 's off the charts !

who know ? we get lucky , maybe a couple of 'em 'll be ours .

you sure you did n't see one of these ?

hello .

i have no idea . are you ready ?

if you do n't mind , perhaps i could pay you another visit sometime .

sounds good .

sure .

i could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine , and you could tell me what you think .

i know . it 's so upsetting . i 'm his number-one fan ... i 've got all his books , every sentence he ever put down . i 'm so proud of my paul sheldon collection ... ... here i am , prattling on and my manners have just flown away . i have n't invited you in . please .

you do n't know ?

paul , this will be our legacy .

this is so exciting . it 's windthorne , her first love , right ?

but the time is now . soon others will come .

i do n't know what you 're talking about .

you 've been out of your room .

i think you 're right .

you really think so ?

wait , let 's do this right . do you have any candles ?

to misery .

what about a bee ... ?

here , in case you think of any ideas .

poor dear ... let 's get you back in bed and i 'll get them for you .

misery 's return ?

yeah , well , it 's a theory . here 's your novril . how does tuna casserole sound for dinner ?

show me the way ?

you 're such a kidder . i have a big surprise for you . but first there 's something you must do .

well , it 's not something you should enter into lightly .

you 'd be amazed at what some people will believe .

i guess that means it 's okay .

the one to town is , but that 's about it . i called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon . i told him who you were and what had happened . he said as long as there 's no infection , you 're not in any danger , and as soon as the road to the hospital is open , they 'll send an ambulance for you .

it has no nobility .

pretty rough so far .

oh , like i could do that ?

it 's crazy , but i do n't really know , i mean i have n't written anything but `` misery '' for so long that -- you read it you can tell me what you think it 's about . maybe you can come up with a title .

i have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage -- only my editor , my agent , and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck .

of course you will . and your arm will be fine , too . your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly , but i finally popped it back in there . but what i 'm most proud of is the work i did on those legs . considering what i had around the house , i do n't think there 's a doctor who could have done any better .

that thing . here it is . right where it 's supposed to be .

could be the weight of the snow .

well , this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the sheriff .

four or five days ago . why ?

people sure like those misery books .

yes , he is .

newspapers ?

that 'd be a first .

sorry i 'm late . jenny 's basketball game went into overtime . if anybody ever told me i 'd have a daughter who 'd get a triple double , i 'd ...

marcia , why are you doing this to me ? do n't you know i 'm scared enough ? do n't you think i remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books ? you think i 'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness ? i 'm doing this because i have to . now , i 'm leaving for colorado to try to finish this and i want your good thoughts -- because if i can make it work ... i might just have something that i want on my tombstone .

hugh , i 'm impressed..

afraid he 's got no choice . i believe i broke his jaw .

you 're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance , are you ?

you won .

oh , i am . later..

magic ...

how do you that .

what are you talking about ?

she would n't be here if it was n't for you , hunt . from this moment you 're responsible for what happens to her , and if you 're looking out for her well-being , i suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me . ball 's in your court , hunt . what 've you got to say ? nyah 's waiting for your answer .

somebody 's been slipping you our mail . come on out here , you bad girl .

oh . then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the cdc scientists in atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a petri dish , doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective . you knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for .

fight a bit of a cold..

if you look at hunt 's operational history , he invariably favors misdirection and deception . for a start he wo n't go into biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security .

oh well , if that 's how you feel about it .

a myth..just a myth ... should n't you be checking out their countersurveillance ?

and the check 's in the mall .

right .

..in the building ...

ambrose obviously got these from nekhorvich on the plane .

i was n't thinking ! just..trying to keep you from getting hurt , that 's all .

no time to explain . you 've done well , and we 're so close . so close . it 's critical that you do whatever ambrose asks . do n't worry - it 'll be over soon.. that 's a promise.. come on , now off you go !

just about..

oh , i do . but as we know i 'm a very poor judge of character .

not me . i was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical .

can you think of a better one ?

no . you can be a thief and have a conscience : not me . why did you have to tell me about this ! what do i have to do to get away from this guy ? when you 're with him , he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now i 'll be at some out-of- the-way-place , a tin of caviar and a bottle of crystal shows up at the table , with two glass , god knows how he finds out at any given moment where i am in the world but he does . and it looks like he 's done it again . you know his definition of a true paranoid ?

you can be a thief and have a conscience .

there 's nearly 2 million in london .

that 's because i 'm on my back .

well , then , what i am i doing here ? i assume i 'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..

that 's not the point . in the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you do n't .

they 've got a book for this ?

ethan hunt .

oh bloody hell . you 're a spy .

you 're apologizing for me ? quite the gentleman..

i 'm missing something here , aside from a 500,000 pound necklace . even after i botched the job , i could 've walked out of there with the bloody thing .

- right..

hey , you put me here . i just do what i 'm told .

- this is very disconerting..

no . just as if i 'd like to .

oh , you do n't have to do that . would n't be a vacation if you did .

where is she now , by the way ? do you know ?

miss hall and ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously . she walked away and he 's wanting her back ever since . we believe she 's our surest and quickest way of location him .

excuse me ?

twice .

if he did n't want to go anywhere without me , how did you get him on the flight ?

an idea , yeah .

do n't be . would n't be on vacation if you did .

yes , i 'm sorry too.. 'you 're sorry and i 'm sorry.. ' - you do know gradski thought the world of you .

i 'm with an old friend now , dmitri .

copy . she 's only got twenty-eight minutes left . track ahead and pick her up .

thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop .

let 's start from the inside out .

they 'll kill me .

okay !

why the masquerade ? why take the risk ? well , claire , youve asked the question and you are the answer .

kittridge is job . max delivered . how far is he from luther ?

i just need you to be safe .

jim was my husband . i want to know who killed him . i want to get the son of a bitch who did this .

i 'm going to answer it .

why have n't they brought us in yet ?

where were you ?

what happened to jim ?

sarah 's reconsidering . claire , transport in five minutes .

if you 're gon na do this again claire , it 's not gon na be on my watch .

if you 're dealing with someone who 's crushed , stabbed , shot and detonated five members of his own imf team , how devastated do you think you 're going to make him by marching ma and uncle donald down to the county courthouse ?

we 've lost enough agents for one night .

heard a lot about you , hunt . dont disappoint me .

yes .

hey , i 'm the flavour of the month !

what makes you trust me ?

krieger < u > did < /u > have the noc list .

and i get to keep the equipment when we 're done .

you 're all kidding yourselves . even with top of the line crypto . cray access . stu 3 's --

what about job ?

okay , boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you 're gon na have virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits .

zero body count .

jim gave an abort , we should walk away .

ok. taking golitsyn 's exit . jack , open the doors .

very well .

would you remove your hat please ?

dont flatter yourself - six was for < u > eastern europe < /u > . you made a lousy deal - ten for the world ? what is that ? but i needed you for the transfer with max . i got a little extra change ; and you got a little extra too .

keep counting claire .

but , he didnt know about you . in all fairness , ethan , claire was never convinced her charms would work with you . but i was supremely confident - having tastes the goods . `` thou shall not covet thy neighbours wife '' , ethan . oh , ethan is in love with you , claire , make no mistake about it . and like all the worlds lovers , hes tortured by the same , one pathetic question - `` does she feel the same way i do ? ''

you got it .

once we leave the safehouse , get in there and crash . ill call you from paris .

if i supposedly deliver the noc list to max , max has agreed to deliver job to me . ill have claire and luther stickell with me on the train . marcel krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in paris .

yeah , smaller countries do n't computerize customs records -

sure . if the main character does .

ah , god , forget it . what are we talking burnout here ?

such a nice ass .

i think i might just take that look .

phew ! weve got five minutes ...

just across the bay , at the fuel depot . the men wanted to try to get home . i ca n't explain .

i do n't know , rose . i do n't know where i 've been , and i do n't know where i 'm going . you should have your eyes opened for you , my friend .

nobody . loretta is getting married .

i know you do n't . that 's the point . i 'll say no more .

let 's go tell your mother .

it looks stupid . it 's a pinky ring . it 's a man 's ring .

and maybe that 's why i had the bad luck . maybe if you gave me away , and i got married in a church , in a wedding dress , instead of at the city hall with strangers standing outside the door , maybe then i would n't had the bad luck i had .

you 've got to come . you 've got to give me away .

again ?

what 's your news ?

you 're not sleepy ?

i do n't know . i got a feeling .

why you looking around so much ?

oh , cosmo !

i wo n't have to shoot those dogs . they will kill each other .

good morning , lucy .

i 'm afraid of who i am .

this is your place .

we 're here .

you are guilty . i 'm guilty .

it 's the best thing there is .

he was having some fun . yeah , well he 's dead . come on , let 's go in .

you look beautiful . your hair ...

what are you talking about ?

she did n't like me .

you 're invited to the wedding ! it 's in a few weeks . why did n't you do like him and be with your dying mother in palermo ?

oh my god .

it 's so bright .

i want to cut you open and crawl inside of you . i want you to swallow me .

i was dead , too .

oh . oh god . i do n't care about anything . i do n't care about anything ! take me to the bed .

son of a bitch !

i am looking where i should to become a bride !

why are you marrying johnny ? he 's a fool !

stop it !

the big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf . this woman was a trap for you . she caught you and you could not get away . so you chewed off your foot ! that was the price you had to pay to be free . johnny had nothing to do with it . you did what you had to do , between you and you , and i know i 'm right , i do n't care what you say . and now you 're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love . that 's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman . you are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again !

you really are stupid , you know that .

bus hit him .

you 'll eat this bloody to feed your blood .

that 's the bad blood between you and johnny ?

yes . do you want ...

i got a lot on my mind , aunt rita .

ssh , it 's me . i 'm calling from the deathbed of my mother .

we have n't spoken in five years . there was some bad blood . i want you to call him and invite him to the wedding . will you do it ?

seven-thirty .

on the floor ?

i do n't understand .

maybe you 're right .

oh god , that 's too bad .

what the hell happened to you ?

how 's the mother ?

will you live here ?

no .

did you see it ?

alright .

i know .

bless me , father , for i have sinned . it 's been two months since my last confession .

my son does not like this johnny cammareri . he says he is a big baby .

okay , i 'll tell her .

a miracle . well , that 's news .

i came right from the airport .

sure .

we could go to my apartment . you could see how the other half lives .

i teach these classes i 've taught for a million years . the spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago . i started off , i was excited about something and i wanted to share it . now it 's rote , it 's the multiplication table . except sometimes . sometimes i 'm droning along and i look up , and there 's this fresh young beautiful face , and it 's all new to her and i 'm this great guy who 's just brilliant and thinks out loud . and when that happens , when i look out among those chairs and look at a young woman 's face , and see me there in her eyes , me the way i always wanted to be and maybe once was , then i ask her out on a date . it does n't last . it can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months , but then she catches on that i 'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she 's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini . and at that moment , she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face , or some action to that effect .

there 's old saying my mother told me . would you like to hear it ?

then i 'd be delighted . i hate eating alone , and it 's amazing how often i end up doing just that .

she was just too young for you .

i 'm sorry if we disturbed you .

yes .

shut up . they 'll hear you in the back .

she looks like one . yes , she does .

not at all . they could be carried .

... what ?

what ? ridden on a horse ?

it is i , arthur , son of uther pendragon , from the castle of camelot . king of all britons , defeator of the saxons , sovereign of all england !

halt ! who goes there ?

he knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered .

dennis ! there 's some lovely filth down here ... oh ! how d'you do ?

you must return here with a shrubbery or else ... you shall not pass through this wood alive !

come here .

had enough ... ?

what ! just a flesh wound .

well , what are you then ?

we shall attack at once .

what with ?

what is your name ?

my liege , i am honored .

good sir knight , will you come with me to camelot , and join our number at the round table ?

it 's always the same ... if i 've said it once .

that is our quest . you know much that is hidden o tim .

shut up !

be quiet !

well ... i am king .

what i object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...

... well , we did do the nose .

blue .

stop ! who approacheth the bridge of death must answer me these questions three ! ere the other side he see !

thursday .

farewell , concorde !

good concorde ... stay here and rest awhile .

i can understand that .

shut up ! you only killed the bride 's father - that 's all -

not you .

listen , alice ...

we do n't need to do anything , apart from just stop him entering the room .

mine is zoot . just zoot but come .

the what ? but you are tired and you must rest awhile . midget ! crapper !

sir gawain .

you are in great peril .

there 's nothing wrong with ... that .

we must examine you .

i knew that someone would come . i knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...

i ca n't move to tidy .

i 'm all right . i just need to rest up a wee bit . the room ... you do n't have to stay .

get out . out !

you 've got three broken ribs , man !

prince leopold ? is he the one who bleeds all day ? so what does his valet do ? wash his poultices for him ?

so ?

have i seen you up in balmoral , mary ?

the future king !

what did you say ?

convey her a message .

i wish to see my mother .

mama ...

nobody has any rights over me .

is that the queen 's request ?

in matters concerning the household , i act on her behalf .

i need a man who knows where i am .

i 'm sorry ?

no love .

i would n't know .

still , someone must attend you . your wife should not have let you out .

i 'm fine .

dare say you can be taught .

i can not believe you are saying this ? you , who i have relied on all this time --

duty ? ! you talk about duty ? !

must they always follow us ?

i hope they did n't go to any trouble , john .

indeed , and for that they are eternally grateful .

but i lack your prose , mr disraeli .

in the press , perhaps . but she 's sold more copies of her highland journal in three months than punch will ever sell in a year . time to wheel her out .

the cartoon or her majesty 's absenteeism ?

dear oh dear .

erysipelas .

cold is good !

unwell ?

he appears to be ... standing by his horse .

what 's the question mark ?

neither are we . something 's wrong with the game , mr. difford .

it 's the game , arcade .

so that 's what we almost died for ?

what ? ! there 's nothing here !

hey , my strength 's low . look out for fireflies .

no . if you 're smart , you run like hell .

i do n't understand . it wants us to play the game . it 's been taunting us ...

my house . i want to try something .

it does n't necessarily mean she 's ...

greg never came home . a few hours is one thing , nick , but this is different . something 's happened to him .

nick ...

so how did you do it , alex ?

what did he do to you ?

this is one of our newest projects . we 're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...

so what do you think ?

fucked up . that 's what they said i was .

it 's been a very strange day .

what 's going on , cynthia ?

we 'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you 'd be pleased to know there 's quite a lot of interest in this role .

there is no problem .

so what 's the problem ?

no . you 're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin ' . now i want ya to think and quit bein ' such a smart aleck . can ya do that for me ?

so since you agree i guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life .

fine . i 'll check out in the morning .

well , sir , i 'm afraid they said you 're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled .

the fact is mr. kesher a representative of your bank called us .

coco ... she 's very nice . we went to school together .

it 's unbelievable !

i ...

my name is rita .

come in . i 'd like you to meet everyone .

stop ... just stop ! that 's what you said from the beginning . if i tell what happened ... they 'll arrest you and put you in jail , so get out of here before ...

but i do n't know , sol . i never heard of sol . i 'd just get in trouble . that 's why we should n't go see about diane selwyn ... it 's better not to get in trouble .

`` but you wo n't ... ''

`` you 're still here ? ''

i 'm not sure about this .

strange to be calling yourself .

maybe that 's where the accident was . there must be a police report . we could call .

when you think about them ... the money ... the key ... does it make you remember anything ?

you do n't remember anything else ?

she has pretty red hair ... she is very kind i think .

thank you ... thank you very much .

right then .

to get rid of this god-awful feeling .

well ... it 's the second one i 've had , but they were both the same ... ... they start out that i 'm in here but it 's not day or night . it 's kinda half night , but it looks just like this except for the light , but i 'm scared like i ca n't tell ya . of all people you 're standing right over there by that counter . you 're in both dreams and you 're scared . i get even more frightened when i see how afraid you are and then i realize what it is - there 's a man ... in back of this place . he 's the one ... he 's the one that 's doing it . i can see him through the wall . i can see his face and i hope i never see that face ever outside a dream .

palmdale .

interesting .

well he said ... you know in his way ... you know what i mean ? besides the guy gettin ' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad , there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal , you know , off the car body , rolled out and slid up through this guy 's neck and just kinda slit his aorta , you know , but they did n't find it right away , so the guy 's losin ' a lot of blood , you know , to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself , he said , while inside the aorta is bleedin ' pretty steady all that time . so , dr. scott 's laughin ' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy . he 's laughin ' you know and shakin ' ... son of a bitch could n't stop laughin ' ... it was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin ' ... the nurse was laughin ' . you know how he is .

that 's what i 'm thinkin ' .

the boys found this on the floor in back of the caddy .

yeah , that 's a funny story .

well , not much ed . just doin ' some stuff for this guy .

and now ladies and gentlemen it 's time for the fabulous crocodile show !

good . nice to see you , bruce . johnny .

bye ... .

well , i 'll see you at the next staff party .

that 's a shame .

well , surprise , surprise , i 've been on the payroll for several years now . i still have an office and secretary . no one even batted an eyelash . do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in new york ?

that was eleven years ago .

what are you doing here ?

where are we going ?

great ...

you okay ?

okay .

it was n't my fault . i was just part of a team . i was doing my job ...

excuse me ?

obviously , but what 's the way out ?

why would he ? his parents are rich .

i 'm not boffing matthew !

hey ! hey ! i 'm talking to you !

first bank ? but how ?

it 's called murderland . it 's paid for by first bank .

so what do we do ?

maybe not , but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory . he stole your passwords .

where ?

what the fuck are you talking about .

hey , try swimming . it works .

issues ? ? ? this guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue i 've ever heard of .

that 's not to tough .

are you hunting wabbits ?

hey buddy , thanks for the help back there !

no ! do n't open any of them ! they 're all wrong . just wait .

what 's wrong ?

when will that be ?

hand me the 3/8ths .

yes sir . it will be the best of your collection , i assure you .

sir ?

that was rather ... . disappointing .

i have entrusted you with a great many things . in your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live . i think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded .

i make roughly four hundred thousand a year .

zach , how old are you , son ?

thank you , sir . sir , may i ask you a question ?

perhaps it was . i was in boarding school for so many years , it 's hard to remember . do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?

was that the old man ?

how long till the drug wears off ?

are n't you the bitter one .

i did n't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new `` park '' .

well , i think if you take several lines out of context , star wars becomes a very sexual movie . i mean listen to this . `` luke , at that speed will you be able to pull out in time ? '' or `` you came in that thing ? you 're braver than i thought '' .

no , idiot . where do we go now ?

we just having our first date when you showed up .

i just need to sit and think for a second .

i think we should follow him ...

actually , i 'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer . so what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?

what an incredible view !

thanks .

as appealing as that sounds ...

this is too easy , i mean i had a speech prepared , then i even wore these pants because i could get on my knees to grovel .

i 'm sure she found your lectures fascinating .

well if i was looking for a victim , i definitely would n't pick your uncle phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds , besides , who would i ask for ransom ? you ? ?

me , i 'll know !

what about giving the other guy a break .

i 'm leaving sunday .

pommeroy .

i will . how 's shelly ?

have fun .

it means ... i 'm a paranoid nitwit who 's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he 's a paranoid nitwit . so why do n't you just say & quot ; oh dad & quot ; and get on the damn plane already ?

i already bought a ticket .

oh , is there anything else you remember , how did you propose ? was it romantic ?

honey , ahh , guys do n't wan na appear over anxious , so if you think there 's a boy that might like you , let him know that you like him , so he wo n't feel he 's taking such a risk when he 's thinking of asking you out .

hey , why do n't you just keep your room and we 'll put the baby in the back yard .

maybe he 's wet ?

i was pushing as fast as i could .

no .

maggie muldovan ? did you ... know her ?

oh .

maggie ... maggie 's little girl .

i am vada margaret sultenfuss . my mother was ...

well actually i was born in siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my dad .

that 's okay .

that 's simple . she was pregnant with me ... when she went to russia and she did n't know ... and then when the russians found out , they waited to shoot her 'cause you 're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world .

no-one invented gravity , it just exists .

well if it is n't vada , the grasshopper girl .

it 's no problem , i had a mother once myself .

the poem is really about attitude . it 's about not giving up and ... it 's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but ... that 's when we should ... force ourselves to push on .

and i 'm gon na use the movies when i give my report . jeffrey says audiences love special effects .

this has been a real confusing day .

that thing you said about your nose ... it was a stranger 's nose ... well it 's not ... it 's ... i mean ... it 's yours ... you know ?

no ... it was me . and i 'm sorry mom , really , ju ... just tell me what to do , i 'll do anything .

really ?

my mother stood on this very spot .

what do you mean & quot ; uh oh & quot ; ? ? ?

woah , watch it !

do n't , come on ! ! !

well , i hope he 's not watching me all the time .

hey what do i care ... i mean , consider the sorts , a chick from pennsylvania , who wears a mood ring .

i do n't mean to alarm you , but i 'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude .

it 's not funny ! i mean what am i gon na do ? without that yearbook i 'm lost . i ca n't just walk around town looking for someone with a wilson high school letter sweater ! ! !

thanks ... .

phil , i think you should consider ... fades as vada walks off

well , wha ... what kind of arrangement ?

was rose .

okay ... take your time ... i 'll ... i 'll go for a walk around .

i do n't know , he 's got an awful lot on his mind right now .

he was very polite , worth the entire five dollars .

right now ? an intimate border with ... mechanical skills .

god ? no i did n't think you 'd want to invoke god rose , because he saw even more than i did . rose look phil , if you want the rights of a husband , you 're gon na have to ask me something but if not , you 're gon na have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are .

he was caressing .

no , there 's no problem , dr. helburn just needs to have his oil changed .

i 'm just tired .

what , did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves ? do n't be misled by the haircut .

you 're nick 's mother ?

i 'll see you then ... i look forward to it .

you could n't ?

well maybe for you .

i 'll be here .

yes , i do .

he 's so tiny .

no . you know they say , that it never rains , that you can barbecue on christmas day ... instead of riding your bike , you just surf over to your friends house . oh , and the place is just crawling with celebrities . i know someone who saw walter matthau picking up his dry-cleaning .

margaret 's my middle name , but everybody called her maggie . los angeles , have you ever been there ?

i do n't know , dad does n't either .

i bet your mom sang to you .

assuming the baby 's a & quot ; supremes & quot ; fan .

how do i know you were gon na show us one ?

ex ... ex , ex ...

yeah , and when those suppers are disrupted because there 's a car crash , or there 's a fire , or a little boy steps on a beehive .

you can get the general idea ...

well , you were pretty great !

honestly harry , he got the mustang , i promise ... ..

okay .

how 's it going chef ?

yeah , me too , mind if i tag along ?

no , why ?

i 'm gon na be putting makeup on some of these people very soon .

okay .

i have n't been to the movies in ages .

it 's no big deal .

thanks , listen i wan na apologize for the other day downstairs , about vada , i was a little harsh .

well the other night at dinner ...

this was the reverend porter 's wife , you have her looking like a two dollar hooker .

i need the job .

i think it 's still available .

yes , i did , very much for a long time , and even now , i get a little sad when i think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked .

he was allergic to bees .

no sweetheart , you ca n't .

in a minute , look it 's hot , sweetie you 'll burn your nose , look out .

any more soda left ?

i was born jaundiced . once i sat on a toilet seat at a truck stop and caught hemorrhoids . and i 've learned to live with this chicken bone that 's been lodged in my throat for the past three years , so i knew dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction . dad , i do n't wan na upset you , but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right . it can only mean one thing . cancer . i 'm dying .

oh yes , oh that 's great .

oh , you 're dressing , uh huh , harry harry harry harry , do n't you know it 's not nice to lie to your big brother ?

nothing , i 'm dressing .

get away from me !

i wrote a poem too .

vada , this is an adult writing class .

yes i do , and i think she 's very good for your father .

he must like shelly , i never saw him hit anyone in his life .

i 'll tell you what , you dedicate your first book to me , and we 'll forget about the whole thing .

i 'm hemorrhaging .

hey there 's your dad and shelly .

okay , seeya . vada ?

just , hurry .

say something it 's too quiet .

okay , okay .

close your eyes .

uh huh .

i 'm gon na marry mr. bixler .

i dunno..

hi vada , can you come out ?

leave then , some friend you are .

for their meat .

so ?

i told you i 'll get in trouble .

do n't do that ! !

is that your dad ?

hmmmm , interesting .

come on , it 's fun .

a girl can never wear enough eye shadow .

i do n't like touching fish , how do you pull the hook out without touching it ?

maybe they had a big breakfast .

oh wow , a real evil canieval .

i ca n't , i have to go home .

needing .

tell him you 've loved him for nine years , but you were afraid to realize it .

i suppose it 's too late to start over .

neosporin ?

i know that ! i was distracted by grief !

... and having `` done the right thing '' will only really be comforting , oh , maybe , five , six times .

chill ? since when do you say ch ...

then why are you compulsively eating ? if you 're not hysterical ?

desperate . to talk .

kindred spirits .

is it ever embarrassing , having your bum kissed in public ?

if you 're waiting for `` do you take this man ? `` , that 's considered poor form .

when are you gon na come clean with your folks ?

oh , that . i forgot i even said th ...

you win .

it 's been awhile . i 'll take your word .

he sucks soup through his front teeth .

... just my bridal shower . and michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at comiskey for a one-thirty game .

... you hate weddings , you never go .

i thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress .

excuse me ?

... look good on kimberly .

then it could all come out , sooner or later . nobody should be in on this . just you and me . or , more correctly , i .

under the circumstances . charmed to know you , jules .

if he gives you grief , i 'll have him skillfully beaten , where the wounds wo n't show .

should we take a walk ? or maybe some food sent up , or something ...

michael ...

is n't there a guard ? a janitor ? a fucking cleaning woman ? i 'll take a burglar ! somebody 's got ta be in th ...

no accents today .

the night we met .

i would n't know . i never had that many first thoughts .

it 's more than that .

you keep saying that .

does it , really ? how come you never took some sell-out establishment job ? you had plenty of chances !

michael , it sounds like a wonderful opportun ...

she would never . never . even think of that .

at first , i thought it was a gag , but she 's always done it !

dance ? you do n't dance ! you learn to dance ? ?

w ...

but they 're so down to earth , such wonderful people ...

i 'm sure glad i 'm hearing all this now , before it 's too late !

like family , huh ?

well , the school will be here . architecture will still be around . right now ...

personally , i think mr. michael 's marrying the wrong girl .

i hate that music .

okay by me - i 'd sure like to see that opryland .

what 's wrong honey .

thank you -- yes , i am .

they can come to the concert in the park .

everybody likes to be as good as their word .

i guess that 's why he thought you right want to help out .

barnett , john triplette . how 's she doing ?

okay . thanks .

you know better than that .

how is she ?

d.c. ? tammany hall ? he came there ?

what 's he running for ?

oh , no , listen , i do n't want to take up too much of your time .

yes . percy warner park ' .

let me know when you do , all right ?

not yet .

sure do . good friend of haven 's .

haven hamilton is your father ? can you arrange an interview ?

hi . look at those flowers . did you grow those .

oh ... a little of both . just thought i 'd look around at nashville for a while .

maybe you can look after me a little .

i do n't really know what you 're talking about .

i have n't gotten into politics yet . i 'm still into music -- except for you . you 're into politics .

have you seen a woman about so high ?

we do n't mess with accessories .

bet the sheets are grey .

oh ... well .

i 've been so worried , dear . where are you ?

just my church and my boys . we all had to go to school and learn hand talking . i just thank the lord they can see .

older .

oh .

i 'm not sure .

i know .

i have to go .

i ca n't remember . in out/out in , something like that . around eight .

oh , tom , of course . what are you doing in nashville ?

yea .

i 'm forty-six . do you like to go up or down ?

oh .

premeditated murder .

money 's no object .

you 're real favorites of his .

what for ?

glad to meet you .

sorry i 'm late .

mary ?

you know bill is really mad at you .

come on back to bed .

ryan o'neal .

pleasure

wade -- i 've been working toward this audition for years .

i know that you are an artist and i am sure you are very religious .

now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself . the more you take off , you see , more money we can raise .

yes , they were .

that 's what tim said .

jeet kune do ... now i did some research on that form of fighting , and i found out that jeet kune do was a style developed by bruce lee . did you know that ?

when you study the martial arts , they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you 're at in your training . am i correct on that point ?

more or less .

apple , pecan , cherry , and key lime .

how do you intend to disappear ? you 're probably the most famous couple in america .

has n't it ?

you 're a breathing icon of justice and that 's why you were chosen to deliver mr. and mrs. knox . we , the prison board we , knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen , an escape attempt , an accident , fire , anything ... jack 'supercop ' scagnetti would be there to look out for his public 's best interests .

they 've killed a shitload of inmates and guards -- -

they 've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries -- -

thank you , sir .

yeah .

yeah . ya see , i ordered that special .

oh my god ! sorry .

no ! ! !

c'mon , c'mon , let 's hurry this up .

no .

i could go for a coke .

that 's indescribable .

do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue ?

was what worth it ?

i 'm keen with anticipation .

we 've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time . and that time has definitely come . i feel it 's apparent to anyone who 's hip to what 's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin ' window . you and mallory may be killers , but you 're not insane . you belong in a prison , not in an asylum . the prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables . now some people are saying , 'so what ? ' i am not one of those people . if we avert our eyes while they do this to you , we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit . today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous , tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what i say is dangerous . where does it all stop ?

yeah , it 's pretty hard to beat the king .

what i 'd like to do -- -

if they stay , they 'll catch you , and they do n't have to catch you -- -

i ca n't go . i 'm too fucked up .

they were especially influenced by 'conquering huns of neptune . '

i admire them .

here 's the layout of the laundry room .

roger , enough with the fucking donuts ! what did i tell you . stop bothering mickey , and get behind your nagra .

roger , no .

that dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake .

huh uh . this dozen is for mickey .

now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode . but we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope .

drink up ! this is a celebration . this is the day we received word we were gon na make television history . we 're gon na have the first sit down , in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever , one day before he 's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life . this is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist 's career . this is wallace with noriega , this is elton john confessing his bi-sexuality to the rolling stone , this is the tearful reporting of the hindenberg disaster , this is truffaut setting the record straight on hitchcock , this is a robert capa photo , this is woodward and bernstien meeting deep throat in an underground parking lot , this is john reid reporting 'the ten days that shook the world ' , this is the hippies ' bloody palms at kent state , the maysles brothers at altamont , this is the nixon/frost interviews ...

but how can you say that ?

three .

it sure is .

you met the kids i have working for me ? great bunch , are n't they ?

who 's going to buy me a beer ?

i 'll smile when it 's funny .

okay .

ai n't she goin ' to take the boy ?

what d'you want ?

guess so .

stop bein ' so damn understandin ' .

no point fixin ' it !

'you kiddin ' ? you ai n't goin ' to no white home . i seen the way they look at you when you go down the street .

about ten dollars .

we can always do that , duff .

what about them ?

what about him ?

hey , watch out ! guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too , huh ?

well , what d'you think ?

what happened , duff ?

thank you .

surprised ?

yeah . knocked around for a couple of months after the army . you been there ?

i do n't know . 'guess i belong here more than there .

look , duff - most of the men i know - they 're kind of sad . when i met you the other day i had a feeling that you 're different . that 's why i went out with you . i thought we might have something to say to each other .

it 's better than it used to be . eight years ago they still had a lynching here . they tied a man to a car and dragged him to death . my father knew who did it , but he did n't say anything .

you got more guts than me , baby . it 's a no-good town .

it 's hard to see any change . but i 'm going to stay . another year , anyway .

that 's why you come back , huh ?

take it easy .

how d'you mean ?

i mean , you 're kind of cut off , are n't you ?

you do n't think much of yourself , do you ?

no . never had much use for hell-howlers . you goin ' ?

no . my mother 's dead . you goin ' back inside ?

well , it 's better than windin ' up like a bum .

you gon na sit at home the rest of your life ? jesus !

like what ?

i bet she 's easy jam .

where ' you goin ' ?

nothin ' . i just figure you were the right man for the job .

what 's eatin ' you , jocko ?

did n't i tell you to beat it - huh ?

how about a drink ?

i 'm duff .

'you will anderson ?

i heard you ! now 'stead of bein ' smart , you just get that car out of here !

she 'll do .

okay .

want to come up the house ? you can stay there till you get on your feet . there 's no point paying a hotel .

yeah , sure . good luck .

come back some other time , will you ?

he 's been hitting it pretty hard . got high blood pressure , too . i guess it 's hard on him , having you around .

maybe i could talk to bud ellis . he might have a job for you at his filling station .

oh yeah ? seems to me , reverend , you ' more concerned 'bout your good . guess it looks kind ' a bad , havin ' me for a son-in-law .

well , you have to be reasonable . now they say you 're a troublemaker . that 's no good . use a little psychology . make 'em think you 're going along - and get what you want .

i doubt it .

just give him a couple of months . a girl like that , she do n't know any tricks .

'oughta give up smoking , jocko .

yeah . all a colored woman wants is your money .

i know .

shut up , will .

nice and slow . you come in . get a look around . then i get my wife .

omar , your wife 's here . ny superiors : will allow me to make the trade now . but i got ta see that you have n't hurt the other hostages . if you have n't , i'11 take the girl and send in your wife .

do n't give her the satisfaction . your wife is on her way ...

sometimes , i want to blow his fucking brains out !

since when ?

you did n't come here to destroy wintermute . you can to save a man you love . a man who is n't even capable of returning that love . such a waste ...

then we would have talked , you and i .

peter said you came to kill us . is that true ?

splendid . we 'll prepare a welcome for them .

a place to tap in . i can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen .

the villa straylight . home of the royal family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as wintermute . if we can get molly in , she can access the mainframe to cripple mute 's defences , the case can destroy it in cyberspace .

we did a pretty good job of pissing them off .

good question . he may not have intended to . the girl in question is lady 3jane . she 's very important to us . the third clone of lady jane tessier .

let 's hope she does n't expect me to swim upstream .

fried air tram in the process . not to mention half my gear .

i can not tell a lie . sorry .

what are you talking about ?

i 've arranged for him to work with us .

the disturbance in cyberspace ... it 's an a.i .

i do n't call this fun , pal . you 're playing god with my body .

put the sense/net police on it . the matrix is their turf .

ah , yes ... the code . it 's a riddle , actually . some fancy of 3jane 's . unfortunately , you 'll have to find out for yourself . i can no more know that code than i can shut down my own hard wired defences . now , our time is running short ... and you have n't even touched your drink .

you 're busy monkeys , mr. case . busy , busy monkeys . always building models ... first stone circles . then cathedrals ... adding machines . i have no idea why i exist , do you know that ? you ... your species eventually _had_ to create me . a thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters . one finally wrote `` wintermute '' .

honesty . almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil .

i do n't have a girl .

trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio ... if we re-enter over mexico , we just might make it .

i an ' i , man . i an ' i .

it 's coming .

you 'd better be , bro . you better be .

not good enough , man . they planted something inside me . i 'm on my own countdown .

fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds .

it 'll flatline your ass .

where the hell have you been ?

wintermute could have infiltrated that machine . reprogrammed him .

it 's mutating ... spreading like a disease .

not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying .

a guy who calls himself armitage .

i do n't know . i do n't know ...

case ... are you okay ?

why did you come here tonight , linda ?

yeah ... fine .

case ... it 's four a.m .

suicide . i just needed to set the record straight .

so you 're a wire junkie .

i 'll show you how to tell what 's going on . if things go south , you unplug me .

the way i feel , believe me , it 'll help .

then you do n't really know who he is , do you ?

like what ?

who ?

i 'm late for lab .

sometimes i wonder what they talk about .

how would you like to join the denominators ? the math team could really use a new brain . we lost our best logarithm guy last year .

so what are your hopes , your dreams , what do you want to be ?

: because he 's guy perkins . listen , you want to walk to na- na 's and get something to eat ?

oh ! how about `` under the sea ? ''

no , thanks -- i 'm doing this on my own .

bridgework ?

anita , remember espadrilles ?

jos , that 's not what we 're --

rosalind and orlando . from `` as you like it '' ? shakespeare ?

i 'll tell you a story . it 's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter .

maybe i could talk to rigfort , you know , tell him the whole story .

get to know them . very well . your job and my job depends on it .

every tom , dick , and harry thinks he can write . but a journalist gets in there , right where the bombs are . he 's aggressive . grabs the bull by the balls .

a flack jacket .

they do n't have to be in the office christmas show ?

oh . cahoon . yeah , he 's -- good .

how many times have i fired her ?

rufus . but i do n't even know where you live .

hey . there .

but i 'm not a penguin .

no , you were n't . do n't you realize the only time i was really happy in the last five years was when i was playing ball with those guys ?

thanks . and what are -

yes , desperately .

i got an assignment from the paper . i 'm going undercover . back to high school .

you ca n't just `` borrow '' my car for a couple of months ! that 's like ten years in bambi life !

how can you just give up like that ? you had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything . do n't you want more ? to move out of mom and dad 's ? pay your own bills ?

so -- have you thought anymore about dartmouth ?

josie -- you make a really beautiful prom queen .

to put us back together again when we fall .

i do n't know . and you know what 's scary -- when you get older it just gets more confusing . i 've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me . you know what , i should n't be talking about this stuff with you .

thank you .

josie , you 're different . when you speak in class , i can tell -- you actually feel the words -- in here . they 're alive . like-eurdora welty talked about the word it moon '' ? how for her it was like a concord grape . `` that grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin -- ''

because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30 's . they do n't even like people in their 30 's .

you like her ?

i do n't know .

i think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches .

hey monty -- you think we 'll get any business today ?

rob , i mean it . i want you to be my first . me and you . once the floor stops spinning , let 's have sex .

duh .

< i > i 'm not the dumb one ... < /i >

and heavy ...

he sure is big , jack ...

< i > three of a kind ... < /i >

< i > jack said we should work together. < /i >

shock .

he stayed a long time .

but why ? it 's < u > your < /u > lunch . there is n't much there in the first place .

just what ?

i 'm grown up now . i have to leave some time .

i know .

< i > listen now , you do n't understand . that 's not the point of christmasland. < /i >

you 'd better be quiet , sandy .

< i > now and forever ... < /i >

just out for a while .

that 's lisa - i got ta get to school .

oh , please ...

jesse 's dead ! i sliced 'im real good !

there is no jesse . i 'm jesse now .

i 'm jesse now , lisa .

no ! i do n't know - everything 's all mixed up . what difference does it make ? i 'm in trouble here . i need your help .

you remember your dreams , grady ?

no shit .

they 've only been trying to unload that dump for five years . that place is bad news . some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy . she watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street . her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door .

yeah , why ?

who , jesse ?

we 'll figure it out together . we 'll stay up all night if we have to . i wo n't let anything happen to you .

you want to talk about it ?

nancy went bonkers from this thing . you would n't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic ?

maybe we can do that . strictly scientific , of course .

what 's this ?

it 's a surprise .

make a left at this corner .

i do n't know - into the air i suppose .

wow ...

no , that 's okay . i was just ... unpacking .

you mean a shithead .

are n't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that ?

ah , nothing .

how come ?

fine .

morning .

i 'm okay . just leave me alone .

'morning , honey .

i 'll get it . please , i do n't mind .

i am not going to let you get me into an argument , goddamn it . not tonight . now get in bed .

he 's full of shit .

deal . thanks .

no fuckin ' way . we 're a team .

that man in my dreams . he 's real is n't he ?

when i was a little girl . three or four . if i had a nightmare , i 'd bring my dad in . the dream would always get better . he always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams . nancy when did it stop ?

i -- i think so !

ca n't be good news coming from you .

nothing like a little cheery news to start the day .

people are still dying . after all this time . stop running away from it . daddy , please ... do n't make me beg . you owe me .

that 's not true . you 're the one who 's trying to forget .

there 's only one man ... and its time for him to talk .

all right . whoever she is , i 'll admit she seems to know more about krueger than i do .

what are we going to do ?

i 'm running out of answers . a patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access . a girl , alone in a room , dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set . nothing makes sense anymore .

do you ? you told me they 're survivors ... and they are . but how much longer they survive is up to us .

that 's right .

sounds like a rough time .

call it a passion . i 've got to get going .

right . they seem to share a group delusion , a `` boogeyman '' for lack of a better word . they 're so traumatized , they 'll do anything not to sleep .

you 'll get to meet them all tomorrow . they 're ... survivors . in a way . all severely sleep disordered . insomnia , narcolepsy , bedwetting ...

your dreams ?

neil , please --

in there . charlie penny owns the place . we knew no one would ever find it . i 'm not even sure i can find it again .

you must find the remains ... and bury them in hallowed ground .

purgatory ... fashioned by the hands of men . twisted , lost souls , the worst of the criminally insane , were locked away in here like animals .

there are times when it does n't offer much comfort . i 've seen you before . sister ... ?

of course .

for god 's sake , elizabeth ... just try to help the kids , will you ? listen to them .

cooling down .

yeah ? what did we ever do ?

i go to bed and get a new horse in the morning .

c'mon .

okay , you 're attacked by the bog demon . go ahead .

hi . good lord -- you 're the spitting image of ...

i 'm delighted .

who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up ?

no , but seriously -- it 's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed .

right . right . so that 's ... fairly good . on the high side ... have you tried the nuts ?

the truth is ...

you expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in england ?

fine . everything much the same . when they change the law spike and i will marry immediately . whereas you ... i 've watched in wonder . awards , glory ...

it 's not going very well -- and it 's our last day .

i mean -- today 's newspapers will be lining tomorrow 's waste paper bins .

i do . your furry friend thought he 'd make a buck or two telling the papers where i was .

you and every person in this country .

you actually have clauses in your contact about nudity ?

and i think the book is the poorer for it .

well , get a message through to him too .

i do n't know . it got to the point where i could n't remember any of the reasons i loved him . and you ... and love ?

do n't think about it . we 'll sort it out . now what would you like -- tea ... bath ... ?

i 'm sorry .

exactly . here we go again .

there 's no 'unless . ' no one has said `` whoopsidaisies '' for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets .

nothing .

floppy , huh ?

ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult , obviously , being set in space .

hi .

no , i 've never played anything cool in my entire life . spike , who i 'll stab to death later , never gave me the message .

hello . hi . hi .

you 're welcome and , may i also say ... heavenly .

oh jesus .

sorry about that ...

thanks . i 'll think about it .

is that right ?

that 's right .

miracles do happen .

no . not true ...

hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected .

shame !

hello , bernie .

di caprio .

me ?

blimey . what 's that ?

unless it 's illegal in the uk to serve liquids below room temperature : i do n't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims ...

okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you , martin ?

yes . no , wait -- let 's go crazy -- i 'll have an orange juice .

no , do n't think i do .

i believe i have .

but i wish to make it clear i 've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy .

there 's an understatement . there are dead people on better form .

any more announcements ?

is it someone we know ?

hello , anna ahm ... scott -- have some wine .

no , sir .

no , no . she does n't .

does she know you 're coming ?

right -- let 's talk about rent ...

hello . i wonder if i could have a little word .

she 's someone i just ca n't -- someone who ... self-evidently ca n't be mine -- and it 's as if i 've taken love-heroin -- and now i ca n't even have it again . i 've opened pandora 's box . and there 's trouble inside .

absolutely no idea . remembering one name 's bad enough ...

hi ...

imagine -- somewhere in the world there 's a man who 's allowed to kiss her .

right -- well , then we have something of an impasse . i tell you what -- i 'll call the police -- and , what can i say ? -- if i 'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario , i really apologize .

what ?

tell us about it ...

yes . good luck , mister mcmurphy .

why , thank you , ma'am ... whew . man , i tell you , that place up there is somethin ' else ! well , ya boys been practicin ' up for the big game ? i figured as much ...

he 's into his wind-up . here 's the next pitch ... and it 's a hit ! it 's a hit !

but there are eighteen patients on the ward , mister mcmurphy .

everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand .

yeah , it 'll satisfy me .

mister mcmurphy , the purpose of this meeting is therapy . group therapy .

that was the first time you attempted to commit suicide , was n't it ? you must try to talk about it , billy .

now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast ... you too , mister mcmurphy .

sorry to have bothered you .

yes , mister mcmurphy ?

pardon me , ma'am , can i ask you somethin ' ?

yes . now go along , mister mcmurphy . go along .

yeah , you ai n't half so bad looking for a head nurse .

just that i 'm glad to be here , miss ratched . i really am .

yes , miss ratched ...

ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her ?

shhh ... let 's move it away from the window ...

whew ! hiya , boys !

your mother .

no .

seriously .

really . she thinks he 's here . even though she 's never met him . even though she 's never laid eyes on him .

sure -- but , before you do that , since we 're putting all our cards on the table , i have a confession to make , too .

i feel like i 've been wandering in the desert for as long as i can remember . with nothing but emptiness around me , wind and sun ... and suddenly , out of the blue , somehow i 've found the oasis .

but ... just to be sure , maybe we ought to shatter each other 's unrealistic images of perfection . you know , each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves .

and , he 's a friend of yours . it 's dwayne .

i 'm a liberal !

that 's it . that 's it . that 's all i need to know . bless you , thank you , thank you .

ha un numero di telefono ?

i 'll bring it back as soon as i can .

please , larry . i have to hurry .

i 'm not pushing it .

smoking or non-smoking ?

amazing .

it was the moth stuff that gave it away , did n't it ? i knew that was too much .

huh ? uh , yeah -- i 've got ta run . tell dwayne hi . maybe someday we can all get together .

oh , hi . i 'm an old high school buddy of dwayne 's . i was in town this weekend , was hoping to stop by and surprise him . but i 've got ta catch a plane so i 'm afraid i 'm not gon na be able to make it .

i brought you that , too .

very funny .

reptilian swine . there 's no such thing . reptiles are n't swine .

okay . i 'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes .

exactly . besides , no hard feelings . you found somebody . i found somebody . i thought we could double .

what ?

nothing . prices are a little steep here , are n't they ?

okay . good . see you then , then .

beautiful place ...

he 's a jerk .

maybe i can change him .

whatareyoudoing ? !

yes . is n't that amazing ?

what ?

i know , but ...

yeah . sociopaths . they 're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that .

okay , okay . you join him . but first will you ask if he 's here ?

your brother ?

we 're saved !

oh . right .

did i or did i not offer to have it cleaned ?

what are you doing ?

you gave it your best shot . you tried .

you 're coming with me ?

no , i have n't . and you forgot about the fortune teller .

the woman at my dry cleaners believes there 's no such thing as coincidence .

after all , he is my brother , and i know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes , but i know him pretty well , and i really do n't think --

is that bad ? ...

i think it was sweet of him to pick it out .

look how big it makes me look . i look like an alp .

i do n't know . i do n't think so .

is he gay ?

yes . you know all the shrinks on donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people 's fantasies .

so , you got ta be a little flexible . look at your brother and me . larry 's not perfect , neither am i. but we work it out . we 're not unrealistic in our expectations , and we have each other . i think you 've got the door number three syndrome .

huh ?

how old are you ?

oh .

and you did n't tell her ?

she said she knew where to find him , and then she grabbed my car keys , and --

faith . larry has something he wants to tell you about damon bradley .

sociologist . and because . pawn shops are just like prostitutes , farm auctions and coal miners . they 're all for sale , but none of 'em would be if they were n't desperate for the money .

no .

no ! that 's not fair . that 's not it at all . look , something somewhere got screwed up . maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed . i may not have the right name , but i was there . i 'm the guy . i 'm -- skywriting ? ?

if you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth

talk louder . i ca n't hear you .

we was robbed last night and we ca n't find no books .

this is for you to figure out . you can have it your way or you can have it his way . but you ca n't have it both ways . am i right , sonny ?

this girl and the father got their hooks in him so deep he does n't know which end is up anymore .

the joey doyle thing . you know how he is . things like that he exaggerates them . too much marquis of queensbury . it softens 'em up .

the point is there is n't much time , kid .

and for all that dough i do n't do nothin ' ?

let me explain you something , kid . stooling is when you rat on your friends , on the guys you 're with . when johnny needs a favor , do n't try to figure it out , just do it . now go ahead , join the congregation .

but going in that church , i 'd be stooling for you , charley . you make a pigeon out of me .

terry ... ?

am i on my feet ... ?

farm ...

terry , for god 's sake .

charley .

my hand .

edie , listen to me ! i want you to believe me . i want to be with you .

edie , your old man 's right , go back to that school out in daisyland . you 're driving yourself nuts you 're driving me nuts stop worrying about the truth worry about yourself .

it 's fun dancing with your eyes closed . i 'm floating . i 'm floating ... .

what are you crying for ?

you 're not sore at me ?

i got my whole life to drink .

listen get this straight do n't look at me when you say them things . it was n't my fault what happened to your brother . fixing joey was n't my idea ... .

now what are you doing ?

oh she 's a beauty .

i really do n't know .

boy , they sure fly nice , do n't they ?

looked like two pieces of rope . and your teeth were

it is n't brains . it 's how you use them .

i 'm with terry .

oh , i thought you was gon na go to work with all them muscles .

he wanted to see me again .

you 're all packed . and here 's your bus ticket . you 're on your way back to st. anne 's .

johnny friendly is layin ' odds that you wo n't get up .

your gun .

conscience ... . i did n't even know i had one until i met you and edie ... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts .

how much is your soul worth if you do n't ?

so help me god !

you still call it ratting ?

father , one thing you got to understand . on the dock we 've always been d ' n d .

i think you could have .

did n't i see you fight in the garden one night three or four years ago ? with a fellow called wilson ?

take it easy .

waterfront crime commission ? what 's that ?

our identification .

raise a hand to me and ... .

i told you lay off .

yeah us golden warriors . you 're a good kid , jimmy , a good tough kid . we stick together , huh , kid ?

i wonder how long she 's goin ' to hang around , huh , terry ?

hey look-

terry ? what do you want ?

i 'm glad what i done today , see ? you give it to joey , you give it to nolan , you give it to charley who was one of your own . you thought you was god almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum ! so i 'm glad what i done you hear me ? glad what i done !

i got it . hot off the press .

how 'd you get that .

oh , he did . half an hour later a certain timothy j. nolan went into secret session with the commission and he did all the talking .

nothing happened , johnny .

ok skip it , einstein . how come you never got no education like the rest of us ?

you know what i mean . leave her alone .

look who says bum !

a dime . one thin dime for a cup of coffee .

what are you down here for to see we do n't make off with any of mister friendly 's precious cargo ?

you do n't think he 'd be helpful ?

maybe so .

whatever you do , do n't do that .

i do n't know . i just do n't know . but do n't give up . we 're not finished yet .

those creatures.. !

it 's an initiation all right , but not of a college as you and i know them . nothing alive looks like that !

i ca n't imagine anything dead playing that music .

all right . do n't worry , i 'll be right beside you .

that 's life . my kisses are alive .

but horror stories ! why all the time horror stories ?

i know the laws of the night . i state there is still time for yet another .

she is to be < b > mine ! < /b > it is so spoken !

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa .

he wants us .

hurt her ? hell , it killed her !

well , seeing as you have so much luck with cars , buddy thought it might be better to bring two . he got this guy he says you know from lompoc , glenn something .

did n't you tell me one-time calls are n't monitored ?

did you know that when you married him ?

he did ? i do n't remember . did he say about me ? in the trunk ?

you did n't visit him in prison .

i know a glenn .

i do n't know where he is .

listen , buddy , the shit that 's about to go down , you 'll be on the phone with your sister for a month . let me do this part alone .

all you got ta do is get in .

they look like plain old rocks .

and who watches your back ?

you find out ?

who says anybody 's gon na be with us ? i say we go to the fights tomorrow , find out what the snoop 's big plan is , then go in ahead of those guys -- < u > alone < /u > .

now that 's a really big house .

forty-five minutes .

just hung up .

outside of that .

well , first off , if you were glenn , you would n't be thinking .

he 's running for his life , he does n't give a shit about you .

say anything in there about karen sisco ?

cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time , waiting to make her move .

we may as well leave her , we 're leaving the car and we got ta leave her some place anyway , what 's the difference where ?

you 're primary , you 're secondary , you 're point man .

you have to know what you 're talking about .

you say in the report glenn did n't have a gun , but you let him get away , too .

is that what you would 've done ?

i wan na be on the task force , daniel .

you were out running this morning , sticking to your routine , anybody happened to notice . but you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five . saving yourself for the main event . then i see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni . carbohydrates for endurance .

oh-kay ...

listen , raymond , a year ago , dea had this guy glenn michaels on possession with intent but could n't make it stick . in his statement , glenn said he went up to detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that .

yeah , i 'm crimes against persons and property now , also sex crimes and child abuse .

other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together . you gon na tell me why you 're comin ' to me instead of the fbi ?

ironic , is n't it ?

you 're right . so why take a chance --

a little .

nervous ?

shit , yeah . white boy even got busted for it . white boy , tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time .

that what they 're wearing these days to break and enter ?

what 's the matter with right here ? it 's nice and warm .

it seems to me i been reading about you in the newspaper . busted out of some joint in florida , huh ?

thirty-two outta what , twenty ?

i told you , i 'm not going back .

you know .

to warn her about chino .

where ?

i do n't know . i had n't worked that part out yet . all i knew was that i liked you , and i did n't want to leave you there , never see you again .

that 's not what you were about to say .

it would be worth the risk .

not yet . do n't say anything yet . okay ?

no . what do you do for a living , gary ?

no , they 're all right . i meant , you just got here .

whatta you mean < u > we 'll < /u > make it an island ?

he 's dead . he did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in charity hospital , i think trying to make up for all the good times he 'd missed . that 's not gon na be me .

how 'd you get this number ?

you know who this is ?

you have to be kidding .

i mean if you did n't know who i was .

and the guy saying he was n't gon na take any more shit from anybody ...

you were married ? all those falls , i 'm surprised you had time .

if i could have a little more room .

the backseat .

you do n't take 'em off , i 'm gon na throw 'em off the overpass while they 're still on your head .

you gon na write me a check ?

what kinda man lets a woman answer the door , this time a night ?

have they got midge up there ?

foley ? that you ?

i ca n't say that i 've paid that much attention to 'em before .

it 's a little late for me .

tell me something . what 's it like , walk in a bank with a gun , stick it up ?

there were others .

and how long was it before they caught up with you ?

meaning time came , i left .

why 's that ?

and is foley a part of this ?

ripley ? you mean the wall street guy ?

i mean i 'm not stealing the fucking car .

we 're not . i 'm helping him , yeah --

foley 's not going to make it . and if he goes down , glenn , you go with him .

i got a big score lined up up north . they would n't even know about it , it was n't for me . i could do it right now myself , except it 's so fucking cold up there in january --

jesus , what 'd you crawl through , a sewer ?

why would i do that ?

no . you gon na stay close to me from now on . so you do n't disappear on me .

yeah , kenneth , why you have to do that to that poor girl .

what -- when ?

studs . hey , son , you must be one a them psychic friends . i was just thinkin ' about you .

just a minute .

your dog was killed ?

i 'm looking for a friend of mine i think maurice knows .

he does n't seem to hold a grudge . what < i > i < /i > want to know is why , they got such a big score up north , did foley hang around miami for so long ? any thoughts on that one ?

i could n't swear to it , but i 'm pretty sure he did .

i want to bust his ass , put him in shackles .

what are you thinking about ?

`` hey , yourself . ''

serving process , a summons and complaint . some con doing mandatory life does n't like macaroni and cheese . he files suit , says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights .

can we change the subject ?

it 's a --

you fit another chanel suit in here ?

yeah , as soon as we got back .

i knew it , soon as i saw they were offering a reward .

foley 's got it .

well , if it is n't the ripper hisself .

not so fast , dick . starting now , there 's gon na be an across the board cost a living increase .

he , i 'm r-red . red s-strange .

if you 're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway , maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes .

well , you p-puked on his feet .

danny , i do n't like this fuckin ' guy .

danny , what the hell are you trying to do out there ?

land of the free .

fuck you .

i guess i 'm used to it . i 've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back .

i 'm saying now you do know . so it 's time for you to fuck off .

i did n't mean it .

let 's go get a drink . unless you 're scared to talk about it .

danny , you know how many times i saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose , and could n't do a thing about it -- for you , or for your mother ... or your father , with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas , and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit ? you 've made your sacrifice , danny . it 's time i made mine .

did n't you say test the limits ?

kill the bastards !

what about easier to hit in an air raid ?

he told me he did n't want to leave me with regret . now that 's all i have .

were . is n't that what you mean ? were . because he 's dead , is n't he ? and that 's why you 've come .

i 'd like to bomb their emperor too . but i think that 'd just piss 'em off . the idea here , gentlemen , is not revenge . we 're here to prove to them that they 're neither invincible nor superior . so let 's try this again . military targets only .

we wo n't have the fuel to get back to the carriers ; they 'll turn and run back to hawaii the minute we 're airborne .

well sure , colonel --

explain what ?

we can explain , colonel .

thank you , sir .

what 's your name ?

sorry to trouble you .

it must of been a convincing letter .

what ? ...

i need to tell you something . i did n't know what it was to lose somebody , to see death and find how much it scares you . that you have n't lived and loved enough . i did n't understand . forgive me .

it 's not your fault , rafe . the letter i wrote you , they --

i 'm going to the war . the real war . hitler 's taken europe . the brits are hanging on by their fingernails , and if they lose , there 'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine . and not just there , but here .

oh , this is betty .

if we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots , we destroy their ability to operate in the pacific for at least a year !

we have achieved surprise , but their carriers are not in port . i do n't like this .

a brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war .

brilliant , admiral .

have the planes made it to china ?

leapin ' jesus !

the council knows i have opposed fighting the americans . no matter how great our resolve , they have resources beyond ours . if we must go to war , there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover . in that time we can conquer all of the pacific , and they will have no choice but to ask for peace .

what 's it going to be , elizabeth ? seventyfive ? eighty ?

hello , lilla !

well , i like to speculate . this book i 'm reading right now , a woman in colorado says she lived in ireland a hundred and fifty years ago . her name was bridey murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived . she was hypnotized . big bestseller .

mom , lots of people are separated and divorced .

hey , you 're a hip chick . you look like you stepped right out of life magazine . any time you want to borrow it again , just ask .

come on mom . give him a break . he 's missing the reunion because of you . you know he wants to go .

welcome to the singles ' scene .

i do n't get it .

the only one ?

charlie , i thought i knew everything about you .

peggy ! where 're you going ? come back !

i know .

let me got ! where are you taking me ?

forget it , it 'll never work .

that 's all i wanted to hear . 'cause i 'm never going to give up on us . it 's easy to fall apart in a crisis . it 's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck . but this is more than love . this is a mental decision . just wait till tomorrow , when you see your birthday present . then you 'll understand .

fat chance . you know , lee wilkins came to hear me last night . he told me to forget it . you told me to forget it . my parents tell me to forget it .

you 're going to blow it , peggy sue . nobody treats charlie bodell like this .

but i 'm not . i 'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you could n't possibly understand .

would you ?

how could you forget ? we talk about seeing other people and you forget ?

not now , charlie . i 've got a headache . get used to the word . roll it around your tongue for a years .

are you taking janet to the reunion tonight ?

there 's something pathetic parked in front of my house .

i ca n't . i 'm too embarrassed .

and we 're here on the couch ...

of course .

yes , sir .

hello , sir . how are things at the hat store ?

have a nice day .

my father . he 's not just the ultimate square . he 's a total crook .

what a treat .

yes . we had a glorious night together . one day you 'll remember and write about it .

but what about the other night ? we were like two stars in the same constellation .

what 're you doing here anyway ?

oh no !

i wanted to apologize for this morning .

we 'll make it , we 'll be fine .

maddy 's party .

yes , he 's fine , too . you saw them at easter .

i have a note .

it 's unbelievable . the man never ages .

okay , what do you want ? what dumb favor do you want me to do ?

teenagers are weird . and you 're the weirdest .

okay . why do n't we do something visionary . change your destiny , peggy sue . change your destiny and marry me .

yeah , yeah . i 'm taking a big gamble . i 've loved him for a long , long time .

ah ... .. they 're very tiny ... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set ...

no offense , but you 're pretty out of it now .

look , the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case . may i make a suggestion ?

jogging . i was running , now i 'm jogging .

oh . and huge portable radios . everything else gets small , but for some reason , portable radios get enormous .

good . you 're discreet . i like that in a partner .

but when did you leave ? are you here until then ? were you there until now ? what direction are you going in ? are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past ? can anyone do it ?

how , did you know about my grandfather ?

absolutely . people , dogs , elephants .

are you doing some kind of science project ?

my god ... ... how is that possible ? you have to help me , doctor yolander . i do n't know what i 'm dealing with here ! they 've dug up my wife ...

well ... uh ... thanks ...

i was building a doggy door .

because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was yolander ...

out ?

geoff , dinner 's ready ! geoff ? !

i 'll be fine , dad .

damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him . i swear that dog 's an idiot .

i got ta go back and do my chores ...

you want me to help ?

this is it ... i was n't sure if it even really existed .

he pissed me off .

i miss him too ...

how did it go with your father last night ?

right here , mom ...

what 's wrong with my face ? you want to know what 's wrong with my face ? i 've got a skin condition . next question , bob ? no more questions ? fine . now can you help me find the complaint ?

you 'll never find it in the dark .

in a word , bob ...

are we interrupting , andy ?

andy ?

thanks , walter .

then , what < u > are < /u > we , drew ? ! the < u > winners < /u > ? `` ladies and gentlemen , the first prize of aids goes to andrew beckett and his lover miguel ... '' excuse me , i 'm not your lover . i 'm your care partner . fuck !

no .

i 'm not going to close the --

we 're not skipping this treatment .

you 're going to the office ? !

thanks for leaving school , and coming here , and ... i will be back . an hour , tops .

thanks , you guys .

thanks for coming in .

it is , and it is n't , charles . macrosystem 's new software copies all the best-known elements of kronos ' spreadsheet program . if they 're allowed to sell it , kronos will get undersold right out of business . for me , the legal principle , involved is copyright infringement .

it was good working with you , andrew . you 're welcome . hey . should n't you put that thing back on ?

what impressed you about him ?

you 're ready , do n't worry .

opera ?

i 've considered that .

there 's a possibility i wo n't be around for the end of this trial .

then we establish how wheeler 's boys recruited you after law school ...

so kenton connected the ... lesion , < u > and < /u > whatever suspicions he had about your personal life ... to this woman , maria ... and blew the whistle on you . suddenly you 're losing files , and it 's time to let you go . but , up to this point , you 've been their golden boy , their rising star ... their behavior is ... inconsistent .

do n't send flowers , joe . i 'm not dead yet .

correct . i do n't .

look . i know i have a case . if you do n't want to take it for personal reasons ...

they sabotaged me .

how many lawyers did you go to , before you called me ?

i was fired by wyant wheeler . i plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against charles wheeler and his partners .

new baby ?

by the time i was fired , there were four lesions on my face , much bigger ...

do you need a break ?

you 'd < u > heard < /u > of aids in 1984 , 85 ?

when ? approximately what year did this event take place ?

yes .

thank you . no more questions .

your earrings ?

in what way ?

objection !

not by touching , or shaking hands , or hugging , using the same toilet ... even kissing someone with aids is safe . but it there 's something in your past you 're worried about ...

according to the deposition , you said you were `` thrilled , impressed , overwhelmed '' by the quality of andrew beckett 's work . do you remember saying that ?

were you pleased with his work ?

do i look gay to you ? relax .

i 'll see you in an hour , max .

two men making love ... ? now tell me again ... < u > why < /u > is that disgusting ?

have you changed your aftershave ?

allright . i admit it : i 'm prejudiced . i do n't want to work with a homosexual . you got me .

duh ...

your aunt teresa is gay ? that beautiful , sensuous woman is a ... < u > lesbian < /u > ?

i < u > know < /u > the difference . that does n't mean i 'm always able to recognize the difference .

in this courtroom , mr. miller , justice is blind . to matters of race , creed , color , religion . and sexual orientation .

very good , joe . now , belinda , i 've got a figure over here , of one million , five . i ...

... to suit their personal desires , and the rest of us have to live with it .

kings are out of fashion . i 'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant . it 's an anti-trust action .

i 've discovered something interesting , charles .

what about other homosexual facilities , whatever they are ?

jesus .

yeah , yeah -- we 're all fuckin ' amazed . anyone not ready for this ?

you mean ... tonight ? with all those things still out there ?

it was just somebody else . from the crash . he was just ... .

bring the light !

i did n't want you to leave me there ... back at the ship ... that 's why i did n't say anything ... .

liquid oxygen canisters inside . start ripping them out . quick hits only -- try to make it last .

just give me your hand .

do n't do this to me ... .

you 're fuckin ' with me . i know you are .

< u > i trusted you < /u > , riddick . goddamn , i trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race .

strong survival instinct . admire that in a woman .

back to the ship , huh ?

what do you see ? riddick ?

why , what 'd you hear ?

an ' now you 're worried about a repeat of history ?

i hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact , but that sand-cat wo n't run at night .

are you fucking high again ? just listen to --

we are n't completely stupid .

stop it , stop it , stop it !

anything < u > else < /u > we should know about you , johns ? christ , here i am lettin ' you play games with our lives when --

he 's a murderer . the law says he 's got ta do his bid .

hijacked a prison transport , made a helluva good run 'fore i tracked him down .

what , you think i 'm doin ' this to prove something ?

i do n't . but that ground looked none too stable , and i do n't want anyone --

< u > we 're gon na find the body < /u > , johns . christ , you 're a cop . why am i tellin ' you this ? we got ta go down and find it .

no juice , looks like it 's been laid up for years . but we might be able to adapt --

did n't bite .

big evil ?

and him ?

hey .

company 's not here , is it ?

look , fry . company says we 're responsible for every one of those --

do n't stop , just slow down . little more space 'tween us and them .

imam . slow down .

no , i 'm not . but < u > he < /u > can .

and you 're certain you can find the way back ? even in the dark ?

we 're all on the same hajj now .

`` some prophet guy . '' and a city man . but he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of god .

some prophet guy ?

so quiet . you get used to the sounds of the ship , then ... .

has anyone seen the young one ? ali ?

please ... this solves nothing ... please ... .

those suns got ta come back < u > sometime < /u > . and if these animals really are phobic about light , we just sit tight till then .

very big beads .

well , just a skiff . disposable , really .

i 'll need a receipt for that . for all these .

anyone else having breathing problems ? aside from me ?

oh , you 're a piece of art , johns . they oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere . or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you .

no . she 's not .

looks clear .

said `` looks clear . ''

how 'bout a cut in your gut ?

well , just keep your bloody-fuckin ' eyes open . do n't want that ratbag sneakin ' up on me bloody-fuckin ' arse .

what , you do n't really think they left with their clothes on the lines ? photos on the walls ?

that 's correct . and you will both stand trial for heresy .

your conclusion is premature . have you forgotten your scripture ? the thirteenth scroll ? 'and proteus brought the upright beast into the garden , and chained him to a tree , and the children made sport of him . '

dr. zaius --

no . you saved me from this fanatic . maybe i can pay you back .

taylor , you 're not in command here . put down that gun .

you 've never told me why this region 's called the forbidden zone .

well , maybe they 're not .

flight is a scientific impossibility .

where there 's one there 's another . and another . and another .

taylor -- quit riding him .

one pistol ... twenty-four rounds of ammo . two medical kits.. one camera ... one tx9 . we 've enough food and water for three days .

got your sensors ?

i do n't know . this beast lost a lot of blood .

him .

of course he does n't know our culture - because he can not think . tell us why all apes are created equal .

get me a collar and leash . i 'm taking him to the infirmary .

those fools and their torches ! do you have any ointment ?

he 's trying to form words .

awww , it still hurts , does n't it ?

to earth ! that we 've landed !

in my world -- before i left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair .

i want her .

what is that ?

how so ?

read it yourself .

then why is he called the accused your honors must think him guilty of something .

let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential , and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the tribunal . you may proceed , dr. honorius .

of course , you could return with us . our society might find a place for you and your mate .

he might have been wiped out by a plague . natural catastrophe . like a fiery storm of meteors . from the looks of this part of your planet , i 'd say that was a fair bet .

okay.up to the cave .

i do n't know .

you may well call it upside down , since you occupy its lowest level . and deservedly . the eastern desert has never been explored -- because we 've always assumed that no life can exist there . save yourself , taylor . tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone ?

however , it 's within my power to grant you a reprieve . that is why i summoned you here tonight . tell me who and what you really are and where you come from , and no veterinary will touch you .

he has a point . on my planet children often play with ape dolls .

you threw us together , remember ? and you guessed right . men , like apes , get despondent without a mate .

cornelius and i have been indicted for heresy . unless we can prove our theories , we do n't stand a chance of acquittal .

where are they now ?

yes , sir .

he 's moving his fingers !

you ai n't a firing squad , you piece of shit ! !

how the hell did he get away ?

yeah , they had claymores strung up in the trees , blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces . baad shit .

tricky bitch , reason you gim me dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so do n't start your game playing with me junior .

come on you can do better than that !

only way you 'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe .

whaddaya talking shit for man . hey junior ! y'ever smoke any shit ?

listen to that shit , that 's good shit !

'lias come naturally .

you mean he 's crazy ? no more crazy ' n the rest of us been out in the bush too long .

you lame taylor ?

no !

out there man - behind the log .

i 'll go with you .

and you , do you believe ?

then the worm has definately turned for you man .

not just me ... it 's the way the whole thing works . people like elias get wasted and people like barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do , we just sit around in the middle and suck on it ! we just do n't add up to dry shit .

yeah , i dropped out of college and told 'em i wanted infantry , combat , and nam ...

you what ? say 'gain .

what we got here a crusader ?

march man in tennessee , sniff the pines ... sniff that crossmounted pussy walkin ' down by the river . what you got taylor ? let 's see three hundred and what ?

shit ! morehouse and sal are short . fu sheng 's going on r & r , you do n't want to send their asses out on an ambush . you got the fresh meat elias .

maybe but i seen it happen at ia drang in '66 , first cavalry and they cut us to fuckin ' pieces ! give me three men , if i 'm wrong , i can still roll up that flank .

then you jes gon na forget 'bout elias and all the good times we done had ? right in here .

yeah , you done said it . revenge on us .

jackson , looks like you got elias ' squad now .

how careful should i be ?

not tonight .

how about taking to uncle larry into the old firm ? he 's a useful guy to have on your side .

i 'm supposing .

i 'm going to vancouver , mr. mitchell .

i 'm mr. campbell , miss mayfield . purely as a matter of routine , i want to ask the name of your bank .

shut up ! cut it out ! even if i have to kill both of us --

mine ?

the money that makes you mr. clark brandon . let 's you live in a penthouse , on top of the vancouver royal . lets you own a cruiser . lets you do as you please , go where you please . you big , open-handed , generous guy . that 's the kind of money it takes , is n't it ?

including killaine ... i still ca n't think of you that way .

there would be a moon tonight .

you 'll be safe here . i wo n't be long . help yourself to anything you want . the galley 's through there . you can make coffee if you like .

that was n't why i called you . why did i hope -- when i had n't any right to hope ?

no percentage in that .

cant be too close for me . right across the street from it suits me . anything else listed ?

it sounds like a fair location . could you be a little more exact ?

no matter . there 's nothing i can do about it .

we 'll find out .

i 'm different . i like it fine .

there 's a lot of night left to live through .

nice of him .

how did you meet him ?

i do n't .

i know it 's a littler late for an apology .

yes , miss .

i understand , betty . i understand perfectly .

no , jeff . you do n't . he 's not a murderer , i tell you . he ; s not a murderer .

looking for peanuts , i suppose .

they call me jeff .

i expected nothing else .

we try to be decent .

you were a galahad , compared to some cops i 've known .

that 's an evasion and you know it .

miss mayfield , the humor of the situation escapes me . within 24 hours i shall know officially whether mitchell was murdered . privately , i 'm quite sure of it now . it happened in your room , and you came to vancouver with him.. at any rate , he made your hotel reservation.. and you arrived together . here in this room he behaved nastily to you , and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat . a few hours later he was found dead on your balcony . would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious ?

i 'll have to know a little more than that .

i was born in new york city . i grew up . and here i am .

this way .

all right . get him .

mr. reed would like you to call him .

mayfield ? oh , that girl you were with last night . you have n't hired me yet . mr. brandon .

what have you got on miss mayfield ?

nice friendly approach you 've got . goble . i could hardly walk when i got out of bed this morning .

i 'm not interested in blind dates .

i buy my shirts by the dozen . fortunately .

you do n't buy it . okay . so i still want betty mayfield . where is she ?

romeo in reverse . uh-uh . no sale , killaine .

your concentrating too hard , killaine . what about margo west ? she had a motive . i guess you know by this time whose gun it was ?

you passed up a dozen chances to arrest her . what toughened you up ?

how about a cup of coffee ?

i rather thought so . and before that , had you ever seen the gun ?

if i can get off .

they 'll arrest that girl . everything points to her .

and now that he 's safe from all other women , you can go on loving him .

mr. clarendon , have you ever seen this before ?

what 's the face for , driscoll ?

thanks , inspector . what are your orders about this wire to san francisco ?

send that ?

i got through to greer , his partner in the detective business . greer wo n't give out .

open it and count it .

i need a receipt . sign your name across the flap .

it 'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet .

if she did n't -- if luck was against him -- he wipes the gun off , reaches the wall up there -- drops it on the chaise .

you can find out .

assume there is something to hid . i go to a lot of trouble . what do i do ? what would you do ?

if i 've got any sense i 'm going to call headquarters .

there was n't any motive ... let 's try out the act .

market ... it seems to me that 's a san francisco exchange .

i 'll know when i find it .

i 've met her .

now , you 're being beastly .

not if it clears the air .

you did n't play it for laughs last night .

oh nothing .

get out of here !

nor i. this is why i gave it to you .

ye have , have ye ?

aye . you have a point there .

you 're very attractive , my dear . and you look very unsophisticated .

in that case , there 's someone here i 'd like to introduce to you . over there .

it 's quite unimportant , mr. mitchell . after all , you got what you wanted .

i told you she 's just..

oh , forget it . clark brandon 's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening . take me ?

how long have you had it ?

you do n't have to make a pose of it .

she is much younger than i am . that 's something i 'm going to have to get used to . is n't it , larry ? they 'll all be much younger than i am . here . tear them up .

rich ? i have n't the faintest idea . why ?

she 's very beautiful . she 's much younger than i am . and she 's rich , i hope .

then i began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now the war had just ended , and the language was much the same as it had been before the first reform act . a small minority thought that england was really theirs , they had made it , they owned it . the rest , the wage earners , were foreigners , outsiders intent on wrecking it all .

it 's a pity she could n't make it up here today .

please do . i was beginning to wonder who this mr. penfield was .

aha . james giving some woman the old heave-ho .

she 's fine . well , actually we 've broken up . it 's all over .

not too bad , thanks . how have you been ?

a glamorous young lady way above his station ...

thank you .

would you like a dessert ... i 'm having one .

might ?

do you think she 's invited you up for her sake or for mine ?

well , you know ...

oh yes ?

i think you 're exaggerating . and if you are n't , you should jolly well change your job .

my real father ? well , he was a flashback .

was that your chapter , then ? it was very good .

fortunate that i was here to keep susan entertained .

what have you been up to ?

that 's enough of that .

ha ha ...

mmm ...

come on . hand over .

next time tell her i 've gone away .

fifteen news items . i got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk . they 're all old pros .

wait ... and with talks at the united nations still making little progress , tension and anxiety settled on mps of all parties in westminster . speaking on the jimmy young show earlier today , mrs thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging . what is it ?

yes , you said .

come into the kitchen . i 'm just making your mother 's tea .

now listen ...

in fact it 's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs . a completely successful fabrication of the past , the ploughman 's lunch was .

tom . .. bed ! go on .

i 'm not fbi anymore .

wild ride , huh ?

bodhi , this is your wake up call , man -- i ... am ... an ... eff ... bee ... eye ... agent ! !

i did . what 's the matter ? do n't trust me ?

yeah , i noticed you limping . but do n't worry about it , brah . do n't worry at all . we 're not gon na land on land !

ever done this before ?

news , last night ... those guys , the ex-presidents ... they robbed my bank yesterday . and i was just there the day before , cashing a check . see ... look . assured trust ... same place .

only make bets i ca n't afford to lose . only way to be 100 % committed .

do n't you gamble ?

where ?

they 're punks . nazis . their brains are wired wrong . they hurt surfing because they give nothing back , and they have no respect for the sea . they just want to get radical . it 's mindless aggression . they 'll never get it , the spiritual side of it .

not yet .

babes .

look , harp . do n't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk . let me ride him in .

what ? now i 'm working the drop car ? who 's handling the scene here ?

figured you did .

johnny ! uh , you , uh ... should call first , you know ? hey , where the hell were you all day ? you got ta at least call in or something . you okay ?

got it .

oh well he must be a surfer .

never saw him , was your basic hit and run .

so what 'd the other guy look like ?

no . i 'm sorry . i have to go . i 'll , uh ... i 'll call you later . i 'm sorry .

you had enough ?

sure , he 's `` the bodhisattva '' .

who 's the girl ?

sure .

gim me a break . one shrimp and fries to go ! anything to drink ?

who cares !

strange , major . there was a firefight . shooting in all directions .

guess i 've picked up some bad habits from you , dutch . now do n't argue with me , you know i 'm right . get to that chopper and hold it for us . we 'll be along .

he 'll be looking for the trip wires . if we 're lucky , he wo n't see this .

that rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles , at most ! we 're almost home . but the chopper wo n't wait .

what the hell do you think you 're doing ?

no more games .

you 're wastin ' your time .

we 're still too far in , they wo n't risk coming in for us .

it was all bullshit . all of it . from the start ... you set us up , got us in here to do your dirty work .

this gets better by the minute .

our rendezvous points and radio freqs . are indicated and fixed . awacs contact on four hour intervals .

go on .

those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world . they 're about to get squeezed . we ca n't let that happen . i needed someone who could get the job done , quick and quiet ... no screw-ups . i needed the best . the best . so , i pulled a few strings at the state department ... and here we are .

like the old days , dillon .

what , sergeant ?

do n't know , only saw one of 'em . camouflaged . he was there ... ... those fucking eyes ...

we 've got most of the flares , frags . and two claymores just outside . nothin 's comin ' close to here without trippin ' on somethin ' .

what 's that , general ?

they never are , dear .

do what you have to do . i do n't take it personally .

let 's not talk about it , it 's too depressing . come on , i 'll show you thunder .

i ... i would take advantage of it .

stop . for just a moment . mr. kross , i 'd like to ask you a few questions < u > before < /u > you sign . you realize that you 're a target . if you were n't mine , you 'd be someone elses , correct ?

not bad for a man who has n't slept in four nights . i 'll get used to it .

you 've got a lot of nerve .

stay with me tonight . not because you 're being paid to . stay with me because you want to .

it 's all just business to you . him . me . your life . everything 's business .

one more night and you 're finally rid of me .

i 'm glad you like it . now be quiet , i 've really got to read these .

to meet some friends . rudolpho , a poet ... benoit , a landlord ... mimi , a flower maker ...

vivian ... i 'm sorry . i was n't prepared for questions about us . it was an idiotic and insensitive thing i did . i should have known that it would hurt you .

vivian ...

you asshole ! i ca n't believe what a -- !

keep talkin ' . i like hearin ' .

i thought maybe you 'd like dinner .

come with me ?

yeah , it 's this box , it has pictures , sound . you do n't have to use your brain at all .

any good ?

of course . how much ?

where 'd you learn to do this ?

vivian --

`` occupational hazard '' .

occupational hazard ?

yeah . too good . i forgot where i was .

yes ...

let me guess , you 're a ... lawyer .

you mean they do n't have hookers .

get in . this side .

for the whole night ?

very good . you ought to have that printed up on your business card .

day jobs , yeah . i 've tried them . turn right .

hey sugar , you lookin ' for a date ?

sales , really ? that 's great . what does she sell ?

our contract guys are working on the kross pension funds . there 's another forty million there . we can bleed 'm dry .

we do n't have the time to bring someone new up to speed . besides ... you 've already impressed everyone you need to , have n't you ?

edward , did you hear me ?

yes ! and you do n't even know where you 're going !

at least stay for a drink . this party 's for you .

and leave all this ? not in a million .

i kissed him , kit . on the mouth .

what do you know ? you look < u > good < /u > . all dressed up . you clean up real nice . you sure do n't fit in down on the boulevard , lookin ' like you do . not that you ever did anyway .

i just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster . i wonder how much she made tonight ?

is that all ? you just fold back the bedspread ?

< u > housekeeping < /u > . i come to turn down the bed .

come on , barney , you and me live in the real world . you do n't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady , mr. thomas .

yeah , well , i check out today .

mr. harris does n't check out until tomorrow .

steak spoon !

you 'll like it fine .

they were real nice to me there . they treated me , y'know ... nice . thanks , barney .

i rather hoped you 'd be wearing it .

i got a dress .

vivian .

no , i 'm sorry , i do n't .

'scume me .

what is with you ?

then why bother curing me ?

then why is there fear behind your eyes ?

my westley will always come for me .

i have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream .

if you 'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you 'll get it , i promise you ...

well ... you were dead .

farm boy . polish my horse 's saddle . i want to see my face shining in it by morning .

well ... ... you see , you use different moves when you 're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one .

why do you wear a mask ? were you burned by acid , or something like that ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 39 .

you 're quick .

veer left . left . left !

i just do n't think it 's right , killing an innocent girl .

inigo .

at miracle max 's . it fit so nice , he said i could keep it .

over the albino , i think .

his true love is marrying another tonight , so who else has cause for ultimate suffering ? excuse me --

-- what ? --

what ? what ?

you want me to read this or not ?

yes .

well , who says life is fair ? where is that written ? life is n't always fair .

no . you could read a little bit more ... if you want . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 17 .

-- well , when does it get good ?

oh . well , thank you very much . it 's very nice of you . your vote of confidence is overwhelming . all right . the princess bride , by s. morgenstern . chapter one . buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of florin .

wrong ! your ears you keep , and i 'll tell you why --

not yet .

true , but that 's hardly common knowledge , is it ? thank you . now , there may be problems once we 're inside .

that does n't leave much time for dilly dallying .

i want my father back , you son- ofa-bitch !

look who knows so much . well , it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead . there 's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead . please open his mouth .

the king 's stinking son fired me . and thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject . while you 're at it , why do n't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it ? we 're closed !

i admit it -- you are better than i am .

you are wonderful !

i was eleven years old . when i was strong enough , i dedicated my life to the study of fencing . so the next time we meet , i will not fail . i will go up to the sixfingered man and say , `` hello , my name is inigo montoya . you killed my father . prepare to die . ''

nothing comes to mind .

thank you .

you keep using that word -- i do not think it means what you think it means . my god ! he 's climbing .

he 's climbing the rope . and he 's gaining on us .

what ?

australia .

he 's afraid . ever since prince humperdinck fired him , his confidence is shattered .

wait a minute . this is a very big decision . it might effect the course of my entire life . i 'll have to think about it . i 'll do it .

please , please , that 's what we 're here for . be careful , that hurt .

shut up .

to failure !

watch closely , as bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin .

who wrote it ?

a flop , ha ! that 's putting it mildly . a disaster ! a catastrophe ! an outrage ! a guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty !

this is where we belong , leo . on top of the world . top of the world !

you 're right . you 're absolutely right . i 'm a nothing . i spend my life counting other people 's money -- people i 'm smarter than , better than . where 's my share ? where 's leo bloom 's share ? i want , i want , i want , i want everything i 've ever seen in the movies !

two pistachios , my good man .

right .

i got it , mr. bialystock .

i 'm hysterical . i 'm having hysterics . i 'm hysterical . i ca n't stop . when i get like this , i ca n't stop . i 'm hysterical .

what are you afraid of ? i 'm not going to hurt you ! what 's the matter with you ?

oh , i fell on my keys . i 've got to get out of here .

so what ? what did it get me ? i 'm wearing a cardboard belt .

well , it 's very easy . you simply raise more money than you really need .

it makes a great deal of difference . that 's fraud . if they found out , you could go to prison .

they come here . they all come here . how do they find me ?

in looking at your books , i 've discovered that ...

koff , koff ... ahem , ahem ... harrumph ...

you have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect . one ... two ...

then account for yourself ! do you believe in god ? do you believe in gold ? why are you looking up old lady 's dresses ? bit of a pervert , eh ?

i 'm leo bloom , i 'm an accountant , i 'm from whitehall and marks , i was sent here to do your books and i 'm terribly sorry i caught you with the old lady .

all right . get a hold of yourself . take a deep breath , let it out slowly and tell me who you are .

scared . ca n't talk .

of course i need you . it 's dark in there .

here . you see . this is the slow fuse . it is much wider . it has more resistance , more density . therefore , it burns slower .

all right , but remember , if you damage the fuhrer 's reputation , i kill you .

vaaaat ? ? ?

wait . no . how do i know i can trust you ? how do i know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived ?

that 's exactly why we want to do this play . to show the world the true hitler , the hitler you knew , the hitler you loved , the hitler with a song in his heart .

with whom ?

yes . she 's an adult , educational toy made in sweden for children over fifty .

smasheroo . smasheroo .

is it all right ? i made it out to cash . you did n't tell me the name of the play .

oooh . i love it . hold me , touch me .

finder 's keepers .

the blue max ...

bismark ...

no , not at all sir , we 're quite serious . we want to produce your play . i have the contracts right here .

heil , baby ! i just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts .

no ! just no ! i have one of those breaking points like any other man , believe it or not , and i 'm near it . there 's just so much pushing i can take and i think ...

what ?

of which morning ?

i always forget to put the sign on , but we do have vacancy . twelve in fact . twelve cabins , twelve vacancies .

sam , they do n't want to prosecute , they just want the money back . it was all in cash ...

but what ? is there anything so terribly wrong about ... making a decision and wanting to hurry ? do you think i 've stolen ... my car ?

go ahead ! spin it around the block . now i know you do n't know anything about engine condition , but you can feel , ca n't you ... and it 's all in the feel , believe me , you feel that one around the block ...

that 's the one i'd 've picked for you myself !

sick of the sight of it ! well , suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile i 'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and ... want some coffee ? i was just about ...

what ?

you got aspirins ? i have something ... not aspirins , but my mother 's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding . teddy was furious when he found out i 'd taken tranquilizers !

it 'll pass . headaches are like resolutions ... you forget them soon as they stop hurting .

just what he told your detective .

did he say anything about my sister ?

what difference does that ...

he did n't mention the money . what he said on the phone is n't important , is it ? he was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother , and he did n't ! that 's what i want you to do something about !

she ai n't missing so much as she 's run away .

i could stand something regular .

what ?

how could we prove ... well , if he opens a new motel on the new highway ... say , a year from now ...

do you know how i found out about you ? i found one of your letters ... it was a nice letter , sam .

where 'd you go to college ?

you 're not .

no , thank you . it 's my problem , too .

nothing . just ... all the lights out ... must be asleep .

in a hurry .

maybe he got some definite lead . maybe he went right on ...

sam ! why call when we can go ?

she 'll need both of us .

no .

i just listened ... and believed everything they told me . 'she stole the money . ' 'we do n't want to get her in trouble . ' 'no do n't bring the police in ' ...

a good reason , i suppose .

and you thought she 'd come up here , to me ? if she had , what reason would she have for not calling you ?

to begin with , where mary is . do you ?

where ?

and live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in fairvale . we 'll have a lot of laughs . when i send my ex-wife her money , you can lick the stamps .

mary , whenever it 's possible , tax- deductible or not , i want to see deductible you . and under any conditions . even respectability .

okay . what do we do instead , write each other lurid love letters ?

sam . this is the last time .

i 'm very tired . and i 'll have a long drive tomorrow . all the way back to phoenix .

yes , and just one time can be enough . thank you .

i 've suggested it myself . but i hate to even think such a thing . she needs me ... and it is n't ... ... it is n't as if she were a maniac , a raving thing ... it 's just that ... sometimes she goes a little mad . we all go a little mad sometimes . have n't you ?

what do you mean about caring ? have you ever seen one of those places ? inside ? laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you ... and my mother there ? why ? has she harmed you ? she 's as harmless as ... one of these stuffed birds .

why do n't you go away ?

what are you running away from ?

it 's all for you . i 'm not hungry . please go ahead .

i 've caused you some trouble .

i 'll be in the office if you want anything ... just tap on the wall .

we have twelve vacancies . twelve cabins , twelve vacancies . they moved away the highway .

no need to apologize ...

i 'd know the difference between mary and an old woman .

arbogast . and after he left ? no , it 's okay , norman . how 's it been going out there ? well , i think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action , a smaller place , you know ... but ...

norman ? sheriff chambers . been just fine , thanks . listen , we got some worries here . did you have a man stop out there tonight ... well , this one would n't be a customer , anyway . a private detective , name of ...

do what ?

this place ! this is n't ' a place . ' it 's my only world . i grew up in that house back there . i was a happy child . my mother and i ... we were more than happy .

i 'm not saying you should n't be contented here , i 'm just doubting that you are . i think if you saw a chance to get out from under ... you 'd unload this place ...

yes .

it is n't necessary .

i suppose you want a cabin .

explains the private detective . he traced her to the bates place . what 'd he exactly say when he called you ?

did she talk ?

tell me , just what you know of dr. meirschultz .

why , yes , to you , mr. -- mr. -- what ?

i 'm detective jones . just dropped in to tell you a bit of news .

not so fast , mrs. buckley . that was your idea !

he is n't here .

no -- the only thing i did for him was to keep track of the man named worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight .

yeah , but they leave you plenty .

you think money is the only requisite . it happens that the poor people are happier .

he can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough .

i do n't agree with you .

i do n't think you could have a real affair . you could n't care for anyone .

i wondered . did he invite you to lunch , or did you invite him ?

but i think these things are beautiful .

hey , what do you think you 're doing ? put that stuff back !

this one 's a story , but i 'm not going to tell you what it is . every time i tell you anything it goes haywire .

about the gale girl , i mean . where do we go from there ? what of it ?

just this -- i got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they have n't got a wax figure of joan gale in that line-up , then i 'm crazy .

well , that 's got nothing to do with this case . can i handle this my way ?

no , i mean it . i think this kid 's entitled to a break .

what do you mean , you poor ham ! this is new year 's !

hotcha ! saved , one job !

oh , yeah ? maybe she did n't commit suicide . she may have been murdered !

yes , she committed suicide yesterday . that 's not news . i heard about it last year .

i 've got to make news , if i have to bite a dog . hey , kelly ! oh , mi gosh , even he walked out on me .

ai n't that something . the mad monk of manhattan . here goes nothing . listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion .

it does n't usually take that long , but i 'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when i met you .

you go in for dangerous things .

there she is ! you 'll find joan gale in that box .

then why are you telling me a crazy lie ? ...

stolen ! what are you trying to do to me ? ... you 're working with the police ! ... you 're trying to make me say something that can be used against me ! you 're trying ...

hmmm . why did n't you tell that to the police ?

for a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --

i 'm not asking you anything . i 'm telling you what i 'm going to do !

you are asking to burn these people ... you are asking ? ...

i want the money back i 've thrown into this rubbish heap .

spare me your classical answer . measurements in . results taken . what if i did n't miss ?

then you get it . you 'll understand .

that they tunnel , magically , through any obstacle , defying the practical laws of physics , in order to end up together --

i could go out of town .

i said she is n't here . now you go home . be a nice boy and go home .

where is she ?

this is n't punishment , i do n't believe in punishment . it 's for your health . obviously you 're sick if you can act like that .

five hundred rabbits ?

well , i like him . i used to be afraid of doctors but not any more . why , he could operate on me any old time and i would n't even be scared .

he did ?

good night , rose .

do n't worry , rose , i wo n't tell a soul .

you better quit that .

well , now that is just too bad ! curiosity killed the cat .

there 's an evil streak in everybody , rose .

hmmph . it has a nipple , all right .

aw , come on , rose , i want to see what the nipple on it is like .

buddy , i am wandering in a wilderness , lost . i just feel awful . do you mind if i get in bed with you for a little while ?

well , it 's only the truth . there are horrible things in the world , rose .

i did n't hear you . i did n't hear that .

was that what they tried to do ? was that why daddy gave you the job , to save you from those scoundrels ?

of course not !

neither do i .

no . why should rose be in my room ?

now i have a plan about rose , an educational plan . she 's getting better and we do n't want any more trouble -- brother , you ought to hear this .

stop gagging like that and putting on a show , and swallow it .

geccch , yehh , guhhhh !

here comes daddy .

you know , buddy , sometimes you make me sick .

no .

that 's a hell of a thing to say . why , rose ?

not for long , boy . i 've outstayed my welcome already .

you know , i do n't know this town any more . all this traffic , new buildings , prosperity ... where have the years gone , daddy ? where is the little town i knew as a boy ?

your wife and children are back in new hampshire in the snow ?

about as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave . good to see you , son . did you bring any of that yankee whisky with you ?

i think we both know her .

the point is you do n't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits . she got protein somewhere , she 's a very strong girl and i think she 'll live ... despite the delay in medical treatment .

honey , he is mr. right .

over ... my ... dead ... body !

this conversation is making me a little sick .

ah , ha ! hold the phone ! no forwarding address , huh ? in the shock of this brilliant move , i forgot something .

it 's because of the children she 's got to go . i do n't want to be holier-than-thou , but the girl does n't have the same outlook we do . morals do n't mean a thing to her , not a thing , and we ca n't have a girl like that in this house .

i do n't intend to fire her , darlin ' .

-- i am not responsible for her epizootics and i did not bring about her epizootics . now listen to me . when i have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --

i am not being brutal to her !

i will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl .

no reason at all , darlin ' .

well , she 's back .

well , she loves children , all right . she loves everybody .

just half-a-cup of coffee . i never eat , darlin ' , you know that . not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses . let 's go , rose , you and brother , let 's hit the road .

who does n't have such thoughts ? we 'd better get going .

i 'll take him with me downtown . and you , too , rose , if you want a ride .

i think about what i 'm doing all the time , and i 've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody . besides , i want you to stay and help rose with the dishes , the poor girl is n't feeling well .

i love rosebud , i am wild about rosebud . i just hope she does n't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character , that 's all . we have growing children in the house .

there are no flies on rose , i do n't know what you 're talking about .

nothing , rose .

rose ... i hate to be mean , but ... oh , nevermind , forget it .

you 're looking very chipper this morning , rose . sow do you feel ?

i do n't believe it .

good god almighty . this is a catastrophe , they wo n't hire her .

you mean a farm ?

yes , sir .

mr. hillyer , i know it was bad and i had n't ought to of done it . but i 'm only a human girl and i ... i ai n't always perfect . i promise i wo n't let him in the house no more , i promise . wo n't you and mrs. hillyer forgive me ?

he 's a nice boy , you 'd like him . he wants to be a fireman .

and who , rose , may i ask , is that ?

there ai n't nobody here , mr. hillyer ! honest , there ai n't !

i mean a human investment , rose , we care about you , you matter to us . but we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop . do you hear me ?

i did n't mean to bite him , i really did n't .

oh , i 'll just mosey around here and there .

oh , anywhere downtown .

if you 've got time before you go `` out , '' get me a half-a-cup of coffee , rose . not a whole cup , a half-a-cup .

do n't make me ... me ... me ... get up !

all right , all right . now calm down , rose , the children will hear you . calm down , let 's talk ... about this thing , let 's discuss it .

you might see her . she writes your daddy , and she and that doctor came to see him , did n't they ? i wish you 'd tell her something ... i never could write letters .

well , no , i did n't actually .

near alexandria . it is n't in alexandria , it is outside it .

took your time gettin ' here .

well , that 's interesting , dave . i always liked washington , it 's a pretty town .

it 's dave wilkie ! i 'm dave wilkie , do n't you remember me ?

i 'm only trying to help him , mother .

yes , go on .

we make our own lives , madam . as for malignancy , i do n't think so , it 's very unlikely . i probably should n't have even mentioned that possibility to her .

a tenant farm ? are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt ?

well , she has one mouth in ten thousand , i do n't see teeth like that once in ten years . her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth , but there is n't a cavity in her head , not a single one . she has perfect teeth .

you look very pretty in it , rose . really , you do .

what are you studying now , mrs. hillyer ?

what were you gon na say ? exactly how did you think he was gon na make the leap from dating a sweet , innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star ?

read my lips : zimmermann or nothing .

have i ever steered you wrong ?

a lincoln ? what lincoln ? lincoln continental ? lincoln mark five ... six ... ?

if i tell you , how do i know you wo n't just club me and take it back ?

word is , while the vice cops on the east coast were standing around playing pocket pool , 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into new york city . and , right now it 's making a cross-country journey to hollywood , u.s.a .

what do you want ? i 'm clean . i been clean a long time .

what day is it ?

what about him ?

the booze .

the ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago ... ?

okay , we got ... one , two ... three ... two caddies and poe 's mustang .

you big , fat sonofabitch , if it were n't for me , you 'd still be sitting in the file room where i found you . and you ... nena ... you 've still got needle scars from where i pulled you out of . you of all people ...

you 're just saying nothing ! tonight is the night .

i say , fuck 'em . let 's go .

i can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt .

you should n't litter .

what 'd i say ?

you could start over again with cash like that .

who said it wa 's me , hub ? anyway ... he fell off a ladder . it was n't really my fault .

let 's go ! fuck everything ! god damn sons of bitching mother humpers ... i 'm gon na rip'em all brand new assholes ... !

laugh it up . you 'll cry later .

i 'm back here , are n't i ? so , you do n't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it .

bullshit .

what ... what kinda thing is that to say ?

birth control 's important .

you been wearing rubbers , billy-boy ?

till the last firework fizzles out tonight , detective , you sit a desk . and , after that , i 'll decide if you keep your shield .

and , what ... what am i forgetting ? oh , yes ... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house !

thank you for sharing that charming image .

good . thought i was imagining them .

well , that 's what i heard , and that 's what i choose to believe .

you suck at lying , archie .

come again ... ?

gimmie a minute .

you get him ?

all for one ...

yeah , my arms healed up real good , and that 's how i wan na keep 'em . that 's what i 'm trying to tell you .

i worked my ass off for my badge , kittle , it 's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there .

going into zimmermann 's pipeline .

this shit was ming .

it 's one of a kind .

han will have that shield down . we 've got to give him more time .

your insight serves you well . bury your feelings deep down , luke . they do you credit . but they could be made to serve the emperor .

yoda spoke of another .

but i had to help my friends .

i tried to stop him once . i could n't do it .

you father was seduced by the dark side of the force . he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader . when that happened , the good man who was your father was destroyed . so what i have told you was true ... from a certain point of view .

you told me vader betrayed and murdered my father .

i ca n't do it , artoo . i ca n't go on alone .

then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for them .

i have felt him , my master .

i told you to remain on the command ship .

the death star will be completed on schedule .

will you take it easy ? let 's just figure out a way to get out of this thing . han , can you reach my lightsaber ?

chewie and i will take care of this . you stay here .

why do n't you leave that crate and come with us ?

yeah , i just got a funny feeling . like i 'm not gon na see her again .

that 's all any of us can see .

guess i owe you some thanks , too , lando .

no , wait ! i thought you were blind !

lando , grab it !

han ! chewie ?

in his belly , you will find a new definition of pain and suffering , as you are slowly digested over a thousand years .

that is correct , commander . and he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress .

form up . and stay alert . we could run out of space real fast .

now ... come on , han , old buddy . do n't let me down .

red leader standing by .

oh ! oh , my . uh , princess leia !

your father ?

vader is here ... now , on this moon .

there is no conflict .

so , you have accepted the truth .

and now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars . any comment ?

feel ? i dunno ... happy .

you serve martinis , doncha ?

c'mon , valiant , does n't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you ? i mean , no offense , but how did a mucky-muck like r.k. maroon find you in the first place ?

oh , no ...

i just stopped by to tell you that i checked out the acme probate .

so you decided to help him after all ?

jesus , eddie , is this who i think it is ?

i do n't wan na think . i wan na drink .

do n't you think anyone 's gon na notice that toontown 's gone ?

these roads can be very treacherous at night , especially in a maniacal toon vehicle .

you 're not takin ' me to downtown < u > toon < /u > town ?

downtown ? fine . get a hold of santino , i 'd be more than glad to talk to him .

the other people who were in here lookin ' for the will . i woulda caught 'em if cheetah here had n't interrupted me .

yes , we talked to mr. maroon . he told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures , and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back . is that true ?

looks like our goose is cooked , our hash is slung , our fait is accompli ...

a joker to the end .

we 're even . by the way , i did find your husband .

i did n't know who i could trust .

i 'm not complainin ' . but give me credit . i 'm the guy who took the pictures of you and acme playin ' pattycake , remember ?

you 've got the wrong idea about me . i ' a a pawn in this just like poor roger . can you help me find him ? i 'll pay you anything .

they say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin ' the other day .

tell me you did n't do a snoop job for a toon named roger the rabbit .

get me a couple juicy pictures . somethin ' i can wise the rabbit up with .

he was blowin ' his lines , all right . so what ?

you damn toon ! no wonder they picked you for the patsy . always got ta play the fool . you make me sick !

we ca n't do anything till it 's dark .

well , right now it 's gon na be your funereal .

i 've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time . but you , edward valiant , are positively funereal !

well , mr. smarty-pants detective , your logic is specious . what prevented mr. acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him ?

well , no , not < u > any < /u > time . only when it was funny .

sorry , eddie , i forgot you 're not a toon .

in other words , the whole goddamn world knows you 're here ! out ! get out !

leave me !

by my heel , i care not .

no , cuz , i rather weep .

uncle , 't is a shame .

why , how now , kinsman ! wherefore storm you so ?

the world is not thy friend , nor the worlds law . then be not poor , but break it , and take this .

i do spy a kind of hope , which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent . if , rather than to marry paris , thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself , then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death , to chide away this shame . no warmth , no breath shall testify thou livest . each part , deprived of supple government , shall stiff and stark and cold appear , like death . now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed , there art thou dead . thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the capulet lie . in the meantime , against thou shalt awake , shall romeo by my letters know our drift , and hither shall he come . and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua . take thou this vial , being then in bed , and this distilling liquor drink thou off . i 'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to mantua .

be not so long to speak i long to die .

affliction is enamoured of thy parts , and thou art wedded to calamity . hence from verona art thou banished . be patient , for the world is broad and wide .

o , she new well . thy love read by rote and could not spell . come , young waverer , come , go with me , in one respect i 'll thy assistant be ; for this alliance may so happy prove , to turn you household rachor to pure love .

i come for my lady juliet .

o , mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants , herbs , stones , and their true qualities : for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give , nor aught so good , but strain 'd from that fair use revolts from true birth , stumbling on abuse : virtue itself turns vice , being misaplied ; and vice sometimes by action dignified . within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power : for this , being smelt , with that part cheers each part ; being tasted , slays all senses with the heart . two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs , grace and rude will ; and where the worser is predominant , full soon the canker death eats up that plant .

romeo , i drink to thee .

then hie you hence to father laurence ' cell ; there stays a husband to make you a wife

o lady dear ! are you so hot ? henceforward do your messages yourself .

three words , dear romeo , and good night indeed . if that thy bent of love be honourable , thy purpose marriage , send me word to-morrow , by one that i 'll procure to come to thee , where and what time thou wilt perform the rite ; and all my fortunes at thy foot i 'll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world .

i must be gone and live , or stay and die .

come gentle night . come loving black-browned night give me my romeo . and when i shall die , take him and cut him out into little stars , and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun . o , i have bought the mansion of love but not possessed , and though i am sold , not yet enjoyed . o , tedious is this day , as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them .

i will not fail : 't is twenty year till then .

romeo ! at what o'clock to-morrow shall i send to thee ?

do not swear at all ; or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , which is the god of my idolatry , and i 'll believe thee .

he jests at scars that never felt a wound . but , soft ! what light through yonder window breaks ? it is the east , and juliet is the sun . arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon , who is already sick and pale with grief , that thou her maid art far more fair than she : be not her maid , since she is envious ; her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it ; oh cast it off . it is my lady , o , it is my love ! o , that she knew she were !

sin from my lips ? o trespass sweetly urged ! give me my sin again .

well , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do ; they pray , grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .

if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine , the gentle sin is this : my lips , two blushing pilgrims , ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss .

here 's goodly gear !

well , what was yours ?

why , may one ask ?

is love a tender thing ? it is too rough , too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .

calm , dishonorable , vile submission ! thou art my souls hate ! tybalt ! you ratcatcher , will you walk ?

mercutio ! thou art consortest with romeo ?

as my american friend larry would say : are you fucking deaf ? it 's under your seat .

is that right ?

budweiser ? you talk to me of beer and you 've the unbridled gall to mention budweiser in the same sentence ? that 's not beer ! christ , it 's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss .

some places , not all . italy , for instance , they 're serious about their food . but try bloody britain , anywhere in the u.k. , you do n't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg . food 's not our thing , you see .

and then ...

no , seamus . i heard you the first time .

you better be careful , seamus , before something happens a plastic surgeon ca n't fix .

lose them !

would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there ?

i thought i did .

i bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using , it was in his contract . cost a nice penny , too , especially that goddamned phone : gregor had expensive tastes .

i better be getting that .

that 's right .

i feel as if i 've wandered onto the set of enter the dragon . could you teach me to do that ?

shut up !

alright , gregor , i 'm ...

i use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target . i trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through nice , relaying that information to you .

it 's quite satifactory .

perhaps we could both go at the same time ...

we 'll double your price .

yes , gregor , they sent me .

he 's company .

not so fast . who 's that ?

you 'll die if you leave here .

what 's a little hate between business partners ?

you 've told me a lot of things , boyo ...

gregor , is that you ?

i do , i do ...

then i guess we 're set .

not exactly .

hello , my friend . he does n't look french to me , vincent .

a samurai has honor , a samurai live by the code of bushido , the way of the warrior . i 'm just a killer for hire . the world is n't about honor , anymore . it 's about survival .

i suppose i want to know how a man like you is created .

so this is what , a test ?

do n't worry , we 'll take care of it .

not for long .

you shoot alright .

i blast the lead car into oblivion ...

who the fuck died and appointed you food czar ?

you should watch what you eat .

i told you , i quit .

you better get some sleep , alright ?

you son-of-a-bitch ...

it 's the one thing i 've got left to hold onto . jean-pierre is one of your closest friends , is he not ?

you would have done that ?

if i was a cop , a real cop , i 'd have busted you a long time ago . this is n't about you , it 's about the job i have to do .

not exactly .

you do n't . you just learn to live with it .

please , help yourself . smoke as many you 'd like .

i hope you do n't mind i took your pack . it was on the table .

well i ai n't a cop .

whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless .

i wonder if she truly left the ira .

christ , i smoke a pack-and-a-half a day , and i tell myself i could be worse . it 's just so damned pleasurable .

same thing , is n't it ?

jujitsu .

i 'm vincent . and i coordinate .

what makes you think we 're here to meet you ?

all depends on whether you want the russian or the gaelic language version .

i might know where you could get a copy .

why do n't we step into my office ...

no . it stops now . it stops here .

then sally comes too .

we 'll take the money and disappear ! we can do it , spend it on the move . even if all of it 's marked , there 's ways around it .

i sure as hell hope so . let 's go .

like hell it is . this is jesse ! jesse !

forget the copies ! he could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original .

all we have to do is get our hands on the original tape . we 'll set him up somehow .

and how do you figure we do that ?

i 'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail . we ca n't risk it .

we 'll leave a few packets in the trunk , and stash the rest somewhere else . car went up in the gunfight .

maybe . who cares ?

what makes you so sure ?

why ?

robbed a bank , c'mon ! do n't you think we would have heard if one , two -- shit i do n't know how many were at large ! do n't you think there would be a bulletin ? this is a big ass drug deal !

we do n't know whose money it is ! they might have robbed a bank , who knows ?

what the hell ...

the horniest dog in nevada .

do n't have much choice , jesse . you saw to that !

maybe . that 's where it was during denning 's last report .

yeah , i guess you 're right . it 's just ... all so sudden ...

well i was just throwing out ideas ...

i love you sally .

i used to think he was something , once ... i was eighteen , i did n't know any better , and he had something steady to offer .

that son of a bitch .

well , not that i would n't sugar bun but earl 's in a bind . they 're going to take his car .

what is this ? do n't be stupid man ...

what ?

you said that , i did n't .

you did n't answer my question . are you saying my word is of no value to you ?

test the product ?

we do n't know . whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system .

that 's news to me . so it 's over at jesse 's office ?

shopping here ?

have i seen her ?

sort of .

aw , now thats gon na take time to clear !

all right youre the super sleuth , what do you want , a medal ?

just goes to show you .

save me the sermon . i 've heard it all before , it 's boring .

not much to tell . nothing really happened .

i ca n't hear a word you 're saying !

what ?

so i want the money and i want it now .

and if we refuse ? your tampering with evidence is n't exactly a misdemeanor , did you ever consider that ?

did they ever find out who they were ?

hi .

i 'm not getting an answer .

he did n't make it into work , and he 's not home .

no , carter . the reason i 'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to hong kong . and what the hell is heaven on earth ?

is it because of the hookers , sir ? you tell them there 's no crime in being lonely .

i 've waited my whole life for this job , but i do n't have a shot in hell of getting it . do you know why ?

two-hundred thousand !

so tell me what you know .

what ? ? where 'd you hear that ?

i 'm an undercover agent for the united states secret service .

el capitan ?

i do n't think so .

isabella molina , from san juan . that seat is taken .

would you like me to tell you how your father died ?

could you have your partner wait for us outside ?

that 's chief inspector , he got promoted .

i 'm busy at the moment .

oh , you american ?

stevie , how 's it going my man ? somebody get a picture , we can use it for a mug shot .

i could use a little vacation .

about fifty grand . i won it at the tables .

it 's okay . i can finally let it go .

your father 's badge ? no way , man . i ca n't take this .

you go after ricky . i got this .

oh no you do n't . do n't you be getting corny on me , lee . i 'll kick your ass from here to compton .

i 'll remember that next time i 'm fighting a box .

are you serious ?

steamed dumplings ?

is it the same heaven , or is it a chinese heaven ?

fine .

shhh , my head hurts .

are you okay ?

i am not third world ugly . women like me , they think i 'm cute . like snoopy .

they do n't know that . what are they gon na do , try and shoot the president during the interview ? i 'll bet isabella can pull some strings . you saw the way she was staring at me .

i would n't do that ! ! !

she 's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg . oh , god ... please do n't let it be a dick .

she just took her hair down . now she 's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she 's using both hands . you better get that ice .

what 's she doing ?

what did you say ?

i 'll try to stay awake . it 's so boring .

you pull a muscle or something ?

i should go back . ricky tan mentioned a boat in hong kong harbor ...

i know . i know . i am sorry .

ask me if i give a shit .

my bullshit ? i 'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters ! i 'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords !

what 's wrong ?

and that 's how you use the lapd choke hold . now start practicing and do n't make me come back here !

you lied to me .

try to land on your feet .

you just said you 're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking .

are you kidding , they love me . i 'm a star , lee . a god to these people !

did you see the way those girls drove off ? i did you a favor .

quite a night , inspector . ricky tan was our only bait , and now he 's gone . you finally got your revenge - at the expense of a u.s. government investigation .

i did n't know which side you were on .

dip me !

how do i know i can trust you ?

look over there . that 's the eye in the sky room .

i 'll take him .

any leads ?

do n't you remember ? i 'm already dead .

put the plates down . it 's over .

heaven on earth ? master , i do n't understand . a temple , where heaven is on earth ? a mountain , where earth reaches for the --

that 's some serious poundage in dollars .

so was i .

be sorry for soon young . she has no chance now .

which one ?

what ? !

i got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours .

are you ok ?

you see what i 'm sayin ' ? you control the space .

stool pigeon .

the license ! you get it ? !

not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking . you seemed as if you liked to talk . i like to let people talk who like to talk . it makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are .

no .

what ? ! this is a class ride , johnson .

alright , johnson , thank you . so ... what are you wearing ?

way he put it , i was the only one he thought could handle it . but you know what the worst thing is ?

hey , i was senior . it 's ok. this is why i get the big bucks .

where 'd you get it ?

and your buddy , mr. lee , is on his way back to china . now , get out . before i file obstruction of justice charges against you .

what ? !

that 's what you were supposed to be !

... the director considers this top priority , considering he is a chinese national and here under difficult circumstances . his name is lee . and he is to be shown every courtesy . within reason .

do it !

okay , look , we 're gon na make a trade . you cross the street , leave her on the sidewalk . i will leave him on this side . then we trade places . you get him , i get her . get the picture , lois ?

you know something ? every time i see this stuff , it reminds me of ... uh ... a double latte grande ... with two shots of non-fat milk .

nobody touches me .

or somethin ' .

yes .

i do .

soon young , do n't worry . you will have many friends very soon . you will see . america is a very friendly place .

i 'm not running .

let him come to the wedding . you 're not running , right ? say it . `` i 'm not ... ''

you look awful .

hold it ! hold it ! i think we 're taking this too fast .

see you at the wedding .

what ? you talked to him ! did you tell him we dated before you were a priest ?

actually , he only asked me one ridiculous question . the rest were n't so bad .

we 'll rub .

his hair ... any color .

`` nothing but net . ''

but one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all . each one was convinced that she was perfect for them , but they did n't see her . and she never showed up so they could n't see her . it 's a very symbolic thing happening . she becomes what she thinks they wanted to be .

overpriced nice apartment and chinese takeout . that 's new york living .

go talk to the pastor and he 'll tell you what to do . and someone will tell me what to do .

no ... they 're interesting guys . each one of these guys has something going for him . i mean , one 's been up everest . another 's become a priest . one 's a pretty good guitar player . and this guy today tried to end world hunger , if you can believe that ...

then you 've got it . if you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands , you 'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot .

what are you trying to say to me , fish ?

unbelievable , she got to you .

get this man a kamikaze .

well , i 'm off . a reporter 's work is never done . mrs. pressman , thank you .

i know . tell me something . do you think she 's going to make it all the way this time ?

sorry , no . i just got one .

have you listened to his morning show , `` wake up with ballplayer '' ?

are you a reporter ?

hello . i 'm looking for maggie carpenter . there was a sign at the hardware store across the street ...

you know , your daughter seems ...

oh , yeah . scared the hell out of skipper .

i do n't have much choice in the matter now , do i ? but i ca n't speak for italics . traitor !

i 've been making friends with your cat . is it okay that i 'm here ?

and the wedding date . there 's the two of us . so , you think ... maybe ... you have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back .

i love you . i love you .

really ?

that 's right . you 're so lost you do n't even know how you like your eggs .

every one of those times i was being supportive . something you wo n't understand .

no . but i think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness . attraction is very misleading . and if it 's mutual , it 's well , terribly distracting .

can you fix it ?

it was in the attic . it was jus sitting there gathering dust .

what was that ? i ca n't order my eggs without sarcasm ?

maybe you should ask her some time . ever thought of that ?

i like it . this whole thing is pretty incredible . i think you could probably sell this lamp idea in new york .

i think so .

done .

seven-fifty .

you 've seen the post-its . i 've already got more juicy material than i need . why should i pay you dollar one ?

my magazine does n't pay because for stories . it 's not what you call ethical .

you 're welcome . your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction . your observations are distorted , ungrounded an incomplete . you must be very proud .

he is not !

a pre-wedding luau ?

see , this is a mature relationship . she 's really found it .

he 's going to be the pastor ?

this party is for you and bob . get your mind off the reporter .

lighten up , what ?

i 'm going to kill myself .

not that he does n't deserve to get fired ... look ! cory 's going for second ! ... sneaky !

a harmless joke .

good boy , port hole .

so i 've come to see it as a bonus , really , that we 've been able to plan , and pay for , so many weddings .

you know , it 's just possible that she has n't read this yet .

`` and her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance . so all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride is n't honeymooning with las vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race ... before the rice hits the ground '' holy moly .

that 's good .

oh !

i think that 's what i 'm saying .

it was my mother 's .

no .

could n't you just do a phone interview ?

oh , it 's just becky , she 's having trouble with rich again . hold on , becky , i 'm going downstairs .

walter , i 'd love to --

if he eats one tiny piece of a nut --

-- because irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he did n't --

we 're going to the rainbow room and the symphony tomorrow night .

what are your plans in new york ?

no , i 'm not .

you do n't know who she was , annie --

thank you . i love you .

you 'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it .

he lost all the weight ... there .

`` on top of the empire state building at sunset on valentine 's day . ''

your destiny can be your doom . look at me and rick .

`` i am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows '' --

`` dear sleepless and son ... ''

not .

nothing 's with me .

what was what ?

you should write something about this .

i want my money .

maybe you should see a shrink .

oh god , it 's major . he 's kissing her on the lips . i have to stop this .

like ... clockwork .

what ?

i notice these things are back in fashion . oh , honey . he 's a lovely man , annie .

we 'll move them --

everybody ! annie has an announcement --

hello .

which means --

why not ?

what was it that made you know ?

have you had any relationship since ?

all righ ...

why not ?

no .

this is going to be tougher than i thought .

i do n't think it could let a woman pay for dinner .

do you want an aisle or a window seat ?

but how am i going to get there ?

this is the best movie i 've ever seen in my life .

no .

this conversation is finished .

shut up ? shut up ? ? ? mom never did that . mom never said shut up to me . mom never yelled at me .

did you call that radio station again ?

i thought i saw a black widow spider .

i 'm glad you liked it . good night , jonah .

there she is .

it was sinking .

-- a slice of pizza --

i 'm not going to think about what they 're not teaching you in school . i am not going to think about it . generally speaking i think we should rule out people who do n't live somewhere near here --

somewhere in the middle .

how did they get our phone number ?

we desperately need a spice rack . desperately .

dad --

i went camping once . i love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed .

what about it ?

what do you mean ?

you 're kidding --

five minutes in the microwave . any one of them , five minutes and done . ready to eat . do you know how to make juice ?

he 's good at it .

you could have called me --

no thanks .

naturally . you think i parked here for a cup of coffee ?

you have n't tried locking them up !

well ?

he says give 'em equality . equality in jobs , equality in the home . also sex equality .

question , question -- the problem , what to do about 'em .

three hours ! just to heat enough water to wash this stuff ! i tell you something . if this strike is ever settled -- which i doubt -- i do n't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us . it should 've been a union demand from the beginning .

are you sad ? are we going to church ? for your confession ?

good . come in , we 'll work it out . sit down , sit down .

you talk of dignity ? after what you 've been doing ?

i do n't know what you 're talking about .

i do n't know . but i can feel it coming . it 's like ... like a lull before the storm . charley vidal says ...

aah ! they 've got other mines . you do n't see the larger picture . they 've got millions . millions . they can outlast us , and they know it .

sure , the standby squad . stand-by for the funeral .

that meeting only lasted ten minutes . the first night i 'm home , and you run to the beer parlor . what is it ? ca n't you bear the sight of me ?

did you have to sign a pledge ? not to go back to the line ?

four nights . how did you sleep ?

there 's jenkins ' wife . you do n't see her on no picket line .

it 's not fair ... i should be there with them . after all , i 'm the one who got the women the vote .

they say i am no good to you .

he 'll have it good . some day .

drink , drink , juanito . you 'll never have it so good .

what 's the matter ?

all right . have your strike . i 'll have my baby . but no hospital will take me , because i 'll be a striker 's wife . the store will cut off our credit , and the kids will go hungry . and we 'll get behind on the payments again , and then they 'll come and take away the radio ...

exactly . and equality 's the one thing the bosses ca n't afford . the biggest club they have over the anglo locals is , `` well -- at least you get more than the mexicans . ''

it 's possible . just negotiate .

you should have helped her without being asked .

but you 've got me doing everything . mama never used to make me dry the ...

you 've got to help around the house !

do n't i have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school ?

the what !

she 's coming . charley vidal gave her a lift .

papa ! we seen 'em ! two scabs ! over there !

ramn -- listen my kids ...

ramn ... listen to me ... i 'm in a jam ... i had to get a job ...

you lump them all together -- anglo workers and anglo bosses .

no , i do n't mind . that 's how come i told you about it .

you got a bathroom i can use before we hit the road ?

what you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom . it 'll take you right to the highway .

fuck man . come on , bobby .

you 're good , princess . i 'll give you that .

do n't worry about it . just go across the street and watch . you 'll know when it 's safe to go back .

really , i do n't want to .

what 's wrong , danny ?

what are you hiding , danny ?

you 've got a comeback for everything , do n't you , danny ? you use 'em like some sort of shield .

it gets me through the day .

then why do n't you leave ? just give me one good reason .

do n't tell me , down deep he 's really not a bad person and you do n't want to see him get hurt .

how ?

i found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter . i gave my grief to jesus christ .

you 're a good man . jimmy the finn .

nah ... i want to keep it . maybe i can use it for like , inspiration ... you know ... like when i detox ?

wait if you do n't trust me , why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs ?

and you want me to do you some big favor ?

i ca n't tell you .

why ?

it do n't matter . i 'll do it . and you sure as hell do n't have to pay me .

but why ? you only owe me five . and that 's not till after we close the deal tonight .

tem thousand dollars . everything i could spare . it 's for you .

why do they call him pooh-bear ?

i 'm getting a 10 % finder 's fee from my man if i can get the right price .

why 's that ?

by not disgracing her memory !

captain steubing thinks you might work for the police .

big bill .

pull your motherfucking pants down .

you want to do this some other time ?

i want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal .

my name is tom .

i thought you 'd be happy .

took a pig-slicker to the heart .

who is it ?

you think you 're so god damned smart , do n't you ?

you think this is funny motherfucker ?

it was all pretty informal . did n't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries .

never mind . dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts .

i 've got a hot one .

excuse me ?

jimmy ?

and he 's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a colombian necktie on whoever it was .

and what does this have to do with me ?

cut to the fucking chase , flynne .

we all know how much you like hearing that . okay , liz , i was wrong . there . you happy ?

look at that place . it 's creepy .

you mean like the donner party ?

alright , i 'll give you that . continue .

a private , sir ?

yes , sir .

it was a hard assignment , that 's why you got it .

you take account of the wind ?

i do n't make jokes about things of , or related to , the preaching of the holy gospel , including the ministerial calling of my family .

like hell , you did .

yes , sir .

you know what a b.a.r . weighs ? nineteen and a half pounds , not counting ammo . and you think these things are comfortable ? they may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each , that 's thirty-six pounds , right there .

you see , i 've got the best house in all of addley . it 's not the biggest house , but it 's got the best location , right next to the junior high baseball field . the garage windows face left field . the guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen s put over them . the first thing i did when i bought the place was take off those screens . two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows . it takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far . i look at my garage windows as a motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up , the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship . i lay there in my hammock and every time i hear the sound of breaking glass , i know we 're one step closer to winning it all .

keep trying .

who 's wade ?

watching .

we left them eighty-eights .

where ?

no , three brothers of his were killed in action . command wants him out of there .

senator 's son ?

that 's general gavin 's . his lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it , i 'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger , i 'll get court marshaled . if you were to take it , they 'd shoot me .

what about our grenades ?

i 'd like to stay , too , captain .

do n't need it , i 'm a cat , i 've got five lives .

a machine gun .

you know classical music ?

i 've been humming it .

reiben , i do n't know what i 'd do without you . sarge , keep ryan close to you and alive .

thanks for drawing that machine gun off me .

i 'll do my best .

do n't let yourself get killed , if you do , they might make me give back the medal and then i wo n't be able to lip off to colonels anymore .

you know wade was the eleventh of the twelve , you 're the last one still alive .

hesitates . then drops his sulfa . fumbles in his pack . finds the morphine .

how about you shut up and take your position ?

how about ... ?

how about you take your position ?

i hope this boy ryan is worth it .

that 's not what we 're here for .

got it , sir . we gon na go take care of those eighty-eights ?

twenty minutes ago . miller damn , i 'll go see if i can find another one . you get reiben , jackson and wade , meet me at transport .

simpson .

some private up there lost three brothers , got a ticket home .

go !

more tanks ... ryan lot 's of them the fear on their faces turns to resignation . they know that they are dead men . they settle into their positions , and prepare to fire and die .

knows what that means . he hears the rumble of the tanks .

i 'd much rather die in caen than ramelle , sir . it 's a personal thing .

upham , are you sure you 've never been in combat ?

stands on the edge of the woods , almost in a trance .

where are you planning on putting private ryan , sir ?

races through the debris . trailed by bullets .

yes , sir .

yes , sir .

fine , you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned private james ryan can carry my fucking gear .

oh , christ , now we got ta listen to that grandfather thing again .

twenty-four-five .

how do you do it ?

demolition , right ?

look , why do n't you check it out for yourself ? see if your father fits the profile .

good for her .

jesus christ . i get in a good mood . how hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood , and then be in a good mood ?

it 's no problem . i called mom and dad in germany ; it 's like they were there .

you 've got to do something special . you 've got to make a statement .

please ? corey alright . alright , okay , here .

it 's too much pressure , it 's not his crowd .

well , you do n't have to be so dramatic about it .

why are you being so hateful to me ? is this because of lloyd ?

you let me believe you . you knew you were guilty , and you let me become a part of it . god , how ... how could you ...

i made their lives better .

no , but you stole from them .

you stole from them , you lied to me . how do you think that 's supposed to make me feel ?

swear to god , i need to know the truth .

unbelievable . this is a nightmare .

you 're not listening to me .

bon voyage .

you 're going .

i know that .

do you wan na make things easier on me ? now tell me where you were because this is , this is bullshit . you can say anything to me , i hope you still know that .

okay .

alright , no more , i 'm going to save it .

ha ! go back ! what a great line !

alright , personalised flight care from corey . books , cassettes , magazines , anything ?

then do n't do it .

i feel like a dick . you must think i 'm a dick .

yeah , uh-huh .

what 's wrong ?

i was just going to tell you that i love you . i said it .

no , we do n't have to say it .

i do n't think so .

am i wrecking my car ?

friends with potential .

i just do n't want it to get too heavy . i feel really overloaded . i have this theory of convergence , that good things always happen with bad things . but i know you have to deal with them at the same time , but i just , i mean i do n't know why they have to happen at the same time , i mean , i do n't know why , i just wish i could work out ... am i just babbling ? do you know what i mean ?

yes .

okay , bye , i will .

really ? um ... i ... well ... you 're really turning me around here ,

so what 's your job this summer ?

alright , this is some of the things they wrote me ; `` glad i finally met you '' , `` you always seemed nice '' , `` wish i could have known you more '' ...

whoa .

you will ? excellent , alright , this is great . you will , really ?

pardon me ?

look diane , i 'm sorry , but i ca n't allow you to leave the country without going to valhere 's graduation party . this gentleman , he 's twenty-two , and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion , and he dresses up as the lakeside rooster , and he ,

well , not monumentally .

so you 're monumentally busy ?

oh , thanks , but i 'm busy .

okay , um , so it 's lloyd and ... uh ... uh ... let 's go out . do you wan na go out ?

yeah , yeah , yeah . you remember ?

yeah .

no noise , no sound , no movement , nothing ! hello , diane ?

man , you never had a chance with a girl like that .

just knowing a person like that exists , knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote ' i still ca n't help loving you ' . that 's got ta be a good thing , right ? that 's got ta be a good thing .

just her name .

she 's very successful .

i know .

well lloyd , i admire you for not hitching a ride . you know , my daughter 's a lot different to you .

yeah lloyd . what are your plans for the future ?

yeah . honey ?

sorry , diane is n't here at the moment .

stop freaking with her head man . just stop playing with her mind , you know ? she 's a human being . she 's a person . she 's very talented , you know .

how many people really know what they want though ? i mean , a lot of them think that they have to know , right ? but inside , they do n't really know , so , i do n't know . but i know that i do n't know .

yeah , hey , oh god . listen , i wanted to ... i do n't know you very well , you know , but i wanted to ask you , how did you get diane court to go out with you ?

later for you , luke .

i love you man .

oskar , please -

where are the guards ?

you 're not telling me something .

when ?

what do you want for him , i 'll give it to you .

you held back stern . you held back the one man most important to my business .

that you know the meaning of the word gratitude . that it 's not some vague thing with you like with some guys .

you know , they told me you were going to be trouble - czurda and scherner .

i asked for metal , you gave me glass .

pistols ?

one of these days the russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate . i 'd like the chance to defend myself . i 'd like my wife to have that chance . my civilian engineers . my secretary .

i need a drink .

so i 'll talk to him about it .

whoever . they 're the ones . they 'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me .

i 'd never ask you for money , you know that . i do n't even like talking about it - money , favors - i find it very awkward , it makes me very uncomfortable -

there will be generations because of what you did .

you do n't ? i do . i see a difference .

give or take what , stern - how many - count them .

i 'll admit it 's a weakness . i do n't think he enjoys it . all right , he does enjoy it , so what ? what do you expect me to do about it ?

ah , yes .

any reason to think next month will be worse ?

yes .

i could try to read this or i could eat my lunch while it 's till hot . we 're doing well ?

the jewish worker 's salary , you pay it directly to the ss , not to the worker . he gets nothing .

we 're aware of that .

find me every variation of himbry and what was the other name ...

shit .

thought he was doing aa .

hello ? ted ?

i 'm inquisitive .

i live here .

what ?

how ? what could i say that would make a difference ? i took away a year of your life -- how do i apologize for that ?

you could start with an apology .

do n't do anything stupid , cotton . you 've come to far .

jesus , youre just as whacked as your son .

parents are always responsible . it all starts in the home .

already did . he 's the perfect suspect , do n't you think ?

do i know you ? you look familiar .

look , i 'm sorry about the face .

what 's your subject ?

it 's not you , derek . i do n't trust myself . i tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men .

i 'm sorry , baby . what can i do ' ?

i skipped . too many `` that 's her '' looks .

the way i see it . well be arrested . go to prison . cash in on the home footage . secure a book deal . if all goes as planned , our trial should coincide with the release of stab ii .

he hates oliver stone .

yeah , how can we help ? do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life ?

he filmed his victims .

dewey , you and i would never make it .

yeah ?

you 're a hard one to figure out . gale it 's that complex yet shallow quality . it 's deliberate .

humor me , sid .

oh my god . how could it happen ?

what do you want ?

who are you ?

i 'll give you one guess .

it 's documented . most serial killers are attractive -- slightly off white males in their twenties .

this has nothing to do with me , joel . there 's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the us at any given time . i ca n't control that . who 's hungry ?

ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece .

i get scared really easy , okay .

now why does she have to be naked ? how does that serve the plot ?

i 'll be right back .

and that cici chick was n't that bad either but i 'm really concerned about my safety now .

look , i 'm stuck on the freeway . i think there was some big accident . it could be a little while so i do n't want you to start freaking if i do n't get there at exactly , eight thirty .

now let 's see you act your way out of this one .

wait , wait . do n't hang up .

it may be maureen reynolds --

nope .

i do n't watch tv and i hate books . whatta you need ?

yeah , but , if i 'm not mistaken , you said in your book that sidney got it wrong before . she accused cotton weary of murdering her mother , and he was sent away for it ! maybe there is a third killer . sidney might know something

shit . sarah darling . i interviewed her too . god , it 's happening again is n't it detective ?

i know what it 's like to see ghosts that do n't go away . to be watching a scary movie in your head , whether you want to or not , watching it alone .

all i know about movie trilogies is in the third one , all bets are off .

call me mark , would you ? cause i 'm gon na keep calling you sidney .

absolutely .

why did n't you tell me ? this is my mother , dewey . why did n't you say something ?

the killer called her .

is that a threat ?

what about angelina tyler ? she was there too .

yeah . a real tragedy .

he was n't superhuman dewey . he was n't superhuman at all .

where 's gale ?

yeah ?

sure , why not . you did save my life , mr . rielly .

gale , i know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again . the whole relationship thing .

oh . oh god . gale --

do n't worry . i 'm prepared for anything .

and who is that ?

i already removed it . i think someone on the film was trying to find sid , and that 's the only reason i came here . to make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything .

and ?

two months ago , the woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'stab 3 ' . she wanted to see the file on sid , for research .

so it 's off to london for a week ? new york for a month ? l.a forever ?

what so you can just exploit her again with another book ? sid does n't need you gale .

what the hell are you guys getting at ? i make horror films , that 's what i do . the studio came to me with 'stab ' . they came to me , check it out .

so you knew sidney prescott 's mother .

honestly , my life .

no really ?

what the hell are you doing ?

listen you sick bastard , what the fuck do you want ?

oh shit it 's my cell !

god damn you gale weathers ! do n't you see ? the killer is choosing his victims as they die in the script ! ben damon 's character was the first one to get offed . so was his girlfriend - but she was n't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then sarah darling 's candy , and now me !

it was in the 70 's , everything was different . i was well known for my parties , rina knew what they were . it was for girls like her to meet men , men who could get them parts , if they made the right impression . nothing happened to her that she did n't invite , in one way or another , no matter what she said afterwards .

who ?

gale weathers ? ! what are you doing here ? no press on the set ! no press , no press on set ! get that woman out of here .

heh , well , that 's tv journalism for ya . stage the news to boost ratings .

hey i really liked that piece you did on me last month . the one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs , and how i faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance would n't sky rocket .

gale watchout !

i know ! he killed kincaid !

what are you talking about ?

oh , you know , the usual small talk , `` what 's new , how ya been , how do you want to die ? ''

oh shit . hello ? director 's office .

roman and everybody else went home for the night . i 'm here for a make-up test .

you 're doing real good . ca n't you figure it out ? i wan na finish this where it all began . woodsboro .

no . you did n't kill my mother . billy loomis and stu macher did .

i want to finish what i started . i want to finish the game .

who the fuck is this ?

hello ?

this is the best part , sid . billy 's got it all figured out . why do you think we kept your father alive so long ? why did we save you for last ?

yeah , we just watched a few movies . took a few notes . it was fun .

and if you get it right -- you die .

where ya going ? it 's not over yet . we 've got one more surprise -- stu , i believe it 's your turn .

you ready to party hard tonight ?

because i 'm trying to build your self-esteem . you 're far too sensitive .

no one 's saying you did .

i 'm gon na rip you up bitch . just like your slut whore mother .

you have to move on , sid .

see , it could n't have been me . i was in jail , remember ?

yeah , it was edited for tv . all the good stuff was cut out and i started thinking about us and how two years ago , we started off kinda hot and heavy , a nice solid `` r '' rating on our way to an nc17 . and how things have changed and , lately , we 're just sot of ... edited for television .

close call .

i 'm sorry . do n't hate me .

your call .

but you 're doing so well .

noooo ... .

it 's an easy category . movie trivia .

how do you know his name ?

i 'm getting scared .

why ? you wan na ask me out ?

is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers ?

do you like scary movies ?

they 've got 900 numbers for that . seeya .

i want to talk to you for a second .

wait , wait , do n't hang up .

sidney 's father ?

i do n't think you 're so bad .

can i bring kenny ?

keeping an eye on things . checking the place out .

he 's not registered . could he have gone to another hotel ?

you think he could still be in town ?

keeping my eye on sidney .

i can hear her . oh mother of god , i can hear her .

casey ? where are you honey ? call the police , goddamnit .

not this time . i owe cotton that much . hell , even i thought that man was guilty .

but it 's so much easier when we make it up .

if i 'm gon na blow this up -- i need hard proof .

he was convicted in a court of law . your testimony put him away . it does n't matter what i think .

what is your problem ? you got what you wanted . cotton weary is in jail . they 're gon na gas him . a book is not gon na change that .

forget it .

i 'm not here to fight .

and why would she do that ?

why would she lie about it ?

she was never attacked . i think she made it all up .

hello sidney .

why would you call me from my front porch ?

so who are you ?

no you did n't .

can you knock ?

fuck you , nut case . where were you last night ?

do n't shoot . it 's me .

stop . right there .

it 's 1995 -- motives are incidental .

i 'm gon na gut your ass in a second .

you 're crazy -- both of you .

why are you doing this ?

remember , there 's safety in numbers .

no way .

grant goodeve -- the oldest brother on eight is enough . remember that show ? he was the one who lived off alone . he would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing `` eight is enough to fill our lives with love ... '' he had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from charles in charge . god , i was in love with grant , he was so hot . the show came on every day after school right during my puberty years . grant goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman .

you have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother 's untimely death . it 's no big deal . you 'll thaw out .

he better not be . i told stu to keep his mouth shut . i think we can live without everybody 's all american for one night .

is billy going to be there tonight ?

come on , let 's rock .

come on . pathos has it 's perks .

i do n't know ...

but if it was n't billy it could be anybody . he could be here at school right now .

no , nothing 's like it used to be .

just another sleepover at the riley 's .

yeah , yeah ... are you okay ?

not anymore . her parents found her hanging from a tree . her insides on the outside .

what happened ?

i did . he 's full of shit .

you 're wound too tight , mills . let it go .

what about the trace on his bank account and the guns ? there must be something to connect him with a past .

go start picking up the pieces . we 'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner .

that 's not necessary . you 're in .

i read about it in the paper .

yeah .

what 's this : `` i 'm declining this case ? '' it do n't work that way .

hey , so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins . but , this was a fat guy . the killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him . and , writing on the walls happens all the time . it 's like the fashionable thing to do .

`` dear detectives , long is the way , and hard , that out of hell leads up to light . '' it 's the murderer 's way of announcing himself .

he had a gun . he had a gun ... and he made it happen . he made me do it ! he made me put that ... that thing on . oh , christ ! he made me wear it ... and ... and he told me to fuck her . he had the gun in my mouth .

and ... and ... and he said ... he asked me if i was married . and , i could see he had a gun in his hand .

okay ...

jesus christ , man , do n't shoot me !

it 's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct .

somerset ...

i seem to remember knocking on your door .

murderers ?

now ... i would n't do something like that , johnny . i like you . i like you a lot .

we 're not just going to pick up two more bodies , are we , johnny ? that would n't be ... shocking enough . would n't keep you on the front page of the newspapers .

you 'll see .

tell me it 's not true .

wrong ! i sympathize completely , because if you ca n't win ... then , if you do n't ignore everything and everyone around you , you ... you become like john doe . it 's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it , because it takes so much work to love . you just have to make sure you do n't stop to think about the abuse , and the damage , because you 'll risk being sad . keep ignoring .

you 're the oldest man i know , somerset .

we had him .

what are you talking about ?

you stupid son of a ...

think about it ...

you ca n't go in there .

this is a waste of time .

if you want to know who 's been reading paradise lost , purgatory , and say ... the life and time of charlie manson , the bureau 's computer will tell you . it might give us a name .

victor 's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month . he says , quote , `` i never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one , and nobody ever complained about him . he 's the best tenant i 've ever had .

listen to me . he 's all about playing games .

sounds like he knew what he was talking about .

how did the fire fight end ?

it was my first one of these . we were a secondary unit , and i was pretty shaky going in . i was still considered a rookie .

what if it 's not that she 's seen something ? what if she 's supposed to see something , but she just has n't been given a chance to see it yet ?

like , because someone 's holding a gun on you .

forced what ?

the leather chair was soaked through with sweat .

i vaguely recall a large , angry man , and someone called norton .

you 've never seen `` the odd couple ? '' this is sick . `` the honeymooners ? ! ''

hello .

i just do n't think we should have that sort of relationship . we 'd start quarreling over insignificant things .

is that clear ?

good .

no .

there 's a bucket . under the table .

maybe i thought i could do more good here than there . i do n't know . look , it 'd be great by me if we did n't start right off kicking each other in the balls . but , you 're calling the shots , lieutenant , so ... however you want it to go .

i need to start getting the feel of it all , right ? meet the people .

this painting ...

i can tell you now , i know ... i 'm positive i made the right decision . i 'm positive . but , there 's never a day that passes that i do n't wish i had decided differently .

oh , tracy ... i have to tell you , i 'm not the one to talk to about this .

i do n't know ...

you should look into private schools .

talk to him about it . he 'll understand if you tell him how you feel .

i mean , you known this city . you 've been here for so long .

you have a strange way about you ... i mean interesting . i 'm sorry . it 's really none of my business . it 's just nice to meet a man who talks like that . if david saw that paper , he 'd say you 're a fag . that 's how he is .

it smells good .

yes . look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here .

when the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together . she was crying too hard to say anything .

you askin ' me to clear out now ?

dunno ... seems so .

in that case , give the boys room ...

another one , eh ?

enough to go around ... i 'd say about a dozen apiece ... mount 'em up !

< u > captain < /u > ... nope , would n't say that ... likely you had your reasons for killin ' futterman ... probably needed killin ' ... i 'm speaking as a ranger now , not as a reverend ... fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that 's raised some question -- that and a missin ' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise .

evenin ' ... evenin ' reverend ... or do i call you 'captain ' ... ?

it 's what we 're here for , ai n't it ?

... like a flower and is cut down ... < u > amen < /u > !

amen ! ... put an 'amen ' to it !

he sure < u > is < /u > goin ' ... he 's sworn in .

but he knows that , sir ... ca n't i stay , sir ?

you tell your pa a company of rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an ' equipped will be in the field by daylight ... headin ' for the south end of the malapai . if he can catch up with us , well an ' good ...

we ai n't goin ' ! we ai n't goin ' without you , debbie ... ethan , get the horses ... i 'll try to keep her talkin ' ...

ay-eh ... made out i was crazy ... ate dirt ... chewed grass ... i fooled 'em , ethan ! ... an ' i got away ...

ai n't been too good ... no sir , not too good ... gettin ' old , ethan ...

ay-eh ... they was here ...

ai n't yours yet .

and maybe you lie ...

i beg your pardon ?

they 'll be back ...

look ! scar ? ... do you know where he went ? and if he has a girl with him ... a < u > white < /u > girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo ...

look ?

oh no ! tell her she 's got to go back ...

scar ?

he just could n't wait ...

you all settled an ' comfortable now ?

yeah ... you want me to know i ai n't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man 's clothes to wear ! ..you tole me that already ... now shut your head !

martin ... i want you to know some- thin ' ...

jorgensen 's been runnin ' his cattle with my own ...

what you goin ' to do ?

yes , sir .

comancheros ...

they 're not white any more -- they 're < u > comanche < /u > ! ... let 's see the bodies ...

was your niece about their age ?

no ... not yet ...

well , you did all a body could , ethan .

martie ... do n't go ! not this time .

but i allus loved you ... you know that , without my sayin ' it ... i could n't bring myself to ask you to wait ... the little i had ... not knowin ' how much longer until we found debbie ...

one letter in five years ... i read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out ...

what ? what am i supposed to sense ?

well , apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you . do n't you remember what we promised to each other ? honesty - trust !

cherry-red tears , your first book . i read it at least nine times . and then i found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair .

what ?

is everything alright ? are n't you feeling well ?

are you crazy ? that costs a fortune !

do you know where fuse box is ?

oh , damnit !

we 're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity ! damned box !

they say it 's fantastic . at least that 's what i read in a men 's magazine . so who are the two lucky ones ?

why else ?

i do n't know all about what happened back then . but it always stood between me and my husband .

frank kosinski . here 's the address . go see him . ask him .

oh , ellen ! i 've been wondering when you 'd come . why do n't you step in .

no , i 've never seen him before .

just call me elisabeth .

well , look here !

romeo and juliet -- just a suggestion .

sir robert de lesseps .

right you are , governor !

romeo ? -- he gave it to henslowe .

wait ! will you desist !

we have no juliet !

burbage , i will see you hanged for a pickpocket .

it 's for henslowe . he paid me .

most interesting .

i have lost my gift . it 's as if my quill is broken . as if the organ of the imagination has dried up . as if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed .

i am here to help you . tell me in your own words .

who is that ?

mr. shakespeare has given me the part of the apothecary !

when ?

no juliet ? !

god 's teeth , am i to suffer this constant stream of interruption ? ! what will you do in act two when he meets the love of his life ?

juliet ? you mean ethel .

where are you going ?

as soon as i have found my muse

the daughter of his enemy .

yes , that 's good . until he meets

what is the story ?

and yours ?

good title .

not new -- my doctor faustus .

kit

`` not having that which , having , makes them short . ''

`` but new struck nine . ''

will you ask her majesty to be patient ? !

be patient , my lord , she is dressing .

two hours at prayer !

but at the playhouse . nurse ?

but silvia i did not care for much . his fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons . stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats ! oh , when can we see another ?

and -- ?

why , lord wessex ! lost your wife so soon ?

your majesty

`` all my fortunes at thy foot i 'll lay , and follow thee my lord throughout the world . ''

`` go ask his name -- if he be married , my grave is like to be my wedding bed . ''

you left it in my bed . come to look for it again .

`` what satisfaction can'st thou have tonight ? ''

she is a beauty , my lord , as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg .

i have , master shakespeare .

you have opened the playhouses ?

i 'll be damned if you are !

who are you , master ?

good bye , my love , a thousand times good bye .

i have hurt you and i am sorry for it .

but i will go to wessex as a widow from these vows , as solemn as they are unsanctified .

i found something in my sleep . the friar who married them will take up their destinies .

no , the morning rooster woke me .

you would not leave me ?

it is strange to me , too .

oh , not for the world !

i will do my duty , my lord .

your father should keep you better informed . he has bought me for you . he returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from saturday . you are allowed to show your pleasure .

i think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance . for what lady could live up to it close to , when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine ? besides , can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a bankside poet and player ?

and her lips ?

yes , my aunt . but perhaps she wept a little . tell me how you love her , will .

your aunt ?

i her letter came to me by the nurse .

wait there .

marlowe ? oh yes , he is the one , lovely waistcoat , shame about the poetry .

not at all .

you old devil . well , anyway , as you can see , we 're leaving .

who ?

what for ? what did you want ? the money ? was that it ?

downstairs , i know . pensioner 's terror ordeal : page six .

from what ? jehovah 's witnesses ?

i do n't know .

but not quite .

you know what i 'm talking about .

when are you going to let the police know ?

i 'm only asking you both to think about it .

juliet ?

i do n't have time to discuss it now . i do n't care so long as he 's not a freak .

i do n't have time .

i see .

what ? uh , no , no , it 's a fake . i picked it up in thailand . the second hand does n't sweep , you see .

that 's it , then .

this is just an informal discussion .

is this being recorded ?

no .

expecting anyone ?

exactly . now i 've been thinking --

what are you doing here ?

boy , am i glad to see you .

no , but he 's looking after the money , so what 's the problem ?

yeah , he 's got to go to work , has n't he ? you think he 'll come down for that ?

he ca n't stay up there .

yes , it is . it 's him . cameron , cameron , come on over.yo !

it 's not for me . it 's for love and happiness forever .

do n't look ?

alex .

did what ?

no . any idea which channel he 's on ?

no , alex , we do n't really love you .

-- which is a hack .

has he tried down the back of the fridge ? i mean , that 's where i normally find things .

just serve .

what ?

what ?

that 's what it cost , david .

you paid two hundred pounds for this ?

would you like to talk about it ?

oh , yes , i 'm fine , thanks , just fine .

are you all right ?

keep it going , alex . you 're unstoppable now .

it 's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction , afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is , quite simply , just that .

yes , sir .

well , it 's a wide range of , eh --

sorry ?

shall i answer it ?

sorry ?

i suppose so .

it 's great . you wan na speak to mary ? hold on ...

you 're in a good mood today , george .

yes and you do n't have to be sarcastic about it , that 's a beautiful thing he 's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at saks --

you make me sick . just be straight for once in your life .

i just thought you 'd like to know --

yes , but ... i thought ...

you suggested it , do n't you think it 's a good idea ?

why did n't you come alone ? lester invited you . did you have to bring her ?

that 's great . you look great , baby , great . dennis , look at felicia 's hair .

no , i know .

i do n't know . just a minute ...

is she all right ?

what about ?

what about ?

whatever you say .

you 're looking great , baby .

george --

-- to be put in that kind of position ...

-- numbers , and i do n't need to place myself in that kind of position .

calm down , baby .

shit .

are you ?

her ?

let it ring .

you do n't have to make conversation with me , i 'm not my mother ... do you have a thing about older women ... that 's sort of faggoty is n't it ?

her hair , i do barbara rush .

they are ?

you do it .

devra , try jackie shawn will you ? and if you do n't reach her , keep trying .

do n't use that tone of voice with me ... never mind , i 'll take gordon .

george !

do n't go , jackie ...

what 's that supposed to mean ?

i want to marry you . i want to take care of you and i want your children , and i want you to be my girl . that 's all i want . that 's all i want out of my life , and it 's a lot .

please , we 'll have to talk later --

where are you going ?

-- yes , honey , you 've got to get out of here .

-- do you want ice ?

look who 's talking .

-- very nice , very nice .

-- oh i thought you were --

-- look , you do n't have to entertain me ...

where do you want to go ?

you always say that ... i really care for lester , do n't i ?

no , i blew it , i blew it with lester .

you were great .

we 're upstairs , george . now come on . behave yourself , and for christ 's sake , do me a favor . do n't let me drink too much .

you 're a genius .

can i count on that ? i just want to see lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight .

did i what ?

i wo n't screw you up .

whew .

no , i 'm sure .

yeah , i think so ...

ca n't you do it out here ?

yeah -- he does n't happen to know that we went together , does he ?

oh , about six weeks now ... lester -- well , he 's very sweet .

no , man .

-- you should n't talk to me like that no matter what , george ... you know better ...

-- otis ?

-- oh my yes .

jackie shawn .

hey , baby , what 's happening ?

did you ?

-- no , it 'll help me , really --

obviously there were others , were n't there ?

baby , do n't do this . i do love you .

where did this come from ?

-- and take this with you .

i 'm very tired , george .

-- she 's a very compulsive girl .

now , jackie --

where 's your car ?

... okay ...

look , either we have a meaningful relationship or we do n't , i 've got to know .

what do you want ?

great ... can we talk later ?

how did it go at the bank ?

okay , baby . okay ...

yeah .

yeah .

how are you , baby ?

i 'm finished with her .

yes i do .

lester , it just happened .

i was gon na give you the money . probably i was . shit , i do n't know , i do n't know anything anymore .

me !

i 'll have to wash one out .

have a drink .

what , do you think i planned it ?

yeah . how long have you been here ?

well yeah , otherwise it just sort , you know , lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --

no it keeps the skin peeling . you 've got to keep the follicles open . you lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that 's how you lose it .

i know it , i know it .

yeah , little election party i 'm giving at the bistro . it 's a pain in the ass but -- i have to do it . we 'll have a little time to talk there .

oh yeah .

i 'm better than the guy i work for .

i did n't say it , she did . how 'd you happen to get in that line of work ?



come on by .



i was too old .

and ?

well , whatever i am , i think i can get you whatever you 'd like .

i 'd like a drink .

fine .

what 's that ?

whatever his name is , that actor .

my secretary saw you with that boy .

how did you lose that key ? oh , george , this is uh miss -- this is jackie .

anyway , you 're crazy .

fine .

that 's right .

oh yeah ?

-- i was in the kitchen doing the dishes and george was out in long beach doing a show ...

-- see , i just know that if i go to egypt , well , things happen , i just do n't know what 'll happen to us , he just never seems to think ahead , does he ?

what ?

well ... it 's not so much the number of times he does it , it 's ... he does it for a long time .

i spent three years with him . i just could n't take it not knowing who was gon na pay the rent ... his unemployment or mine . george was adorable but it drove me crackers . now at least i 'm comfortable . lester does what he says he 'll do . maybe you 're happy living like a gypsy . are you ?

i know , i 'm sorry .

-- just wonderful .

-- yes , jill .

we 'll let you know tomorrow .

no .

no ... how long did you say ?

good .

do you feel bad ?

yes , dad .

you mean they ate each other up ?

dad ?

you 're scared of room 237 , ain'tcha ?

room 237 ?

now this is where we keep all of out meat . you got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers . you got twelve- turkeys , two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb . do you like lamb , doc ?

mommy !

mommy ... mommy ... !

well all right . but really do n't make a sound .

do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter ?

thank you .

your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined , mr. torrance . somewhat more resourceful , she seems to have got the better of you .

no need to rub it in , mr. grady . i 'll deal with that situation as soon as i get out of here .

she eh ... interferes .

how ?

who ?

why no , sir . i do n't believe so .

that 's right , sir .

awfully nice of you to say . of course i intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree .

i 'm afraid it 's advocaat sir . it tends to stain .

all right , sir .

hallo . my name 's dick halloran . i 'm the head chef up at the overlook hotel .

dick , can we borrow mrs. torrance for a few minutes ? we 're on our way through to the basement - i promise we wo n't keep her very long .

nice to meet you .

bill , how do you do ?

thank you for saying so .

give me the bat .

stop it !

why ?

yes ...

and you did n't see anything at all ?

i love it . i really do . i 've never been this happy , or comfortable anywhere .

well , that is eh quite a story .

the police eh ... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever , a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are

physically , it 's not a very demanding job . the only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh ... the tremendous sense of isolation .

... the winters can be fantastically cruel , and the basic idea is to ... to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur . and this consists mainly of running the boiler , heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis , repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs , so that the elements ca n't get a foothold .

let 's see , where were we ? yes . i was about to explain that eh ... our season here runs from oh may 15th to october 30th and then we close down completely until the following may .

have any trouble finding us ?

we can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably .

even before anybody knew what a jet set was . we 've had four presidents who stayed here , lots of movie stars .

when me and sissy were kids , we were just like you two .

would you kids mind telling me how this guy lowe became a werewolf to begin with ?

do n't you touch me , snotbrains !

if you do n't stop it i 'm going to vomit . i mean it .

what 's that ?

then i 'd have to kick your ass , dear boy . go on , now .

after marty called me with his latest thrilling tale of wonder , i did . he 's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all .

no- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face .

marty , marty , you should hear yourself !

it wasn't- i 'll bet you it was n't . because to get a prescription he 'd have to see a doctor .

was it a prescription ?

it came for me ! i shot it in the eye ! now he 's wearing an eye-patch !

thanks a million , uncle al !

save this one for last .

but you are , you know- you are my dear boy .

okay , okay . dwight evans .

i ca n't wait until next sunday , when the choir performs again . did you see the people walk right in from the street ? that music , that heavenly music -- it called to them .

i have n't enjoyed mass this much in years . what a marvelous program . innovative . inspiring . you are to be commended .

okay , so maybe i 'm a nun -- so , you want to ask me something ? you want to listen , for once in your little lives ? you want to pay some attention ?

sing !

sing !

hey , i know , it 's hard . but do what i do .

well , what about the sex stuff ? what if some dude is after you , and he 's always saying stuff , commin ' on sweet and mellow . like , oh , baby , you know you 'll love it . oh , baby , if you loved me , you 'd stay .

then stop trying to memorize it . hit the road .

i feel sorry for you , vincent . and i forgive you .

babe , what happened here ? look at you .

sure .

is that why you came up here , christy ? to thank me ?

how did i get so lucky ? what is it now , five years we 've been together ? who do i thank ?

this prom is a real drag .

damnation was all i could see

we know you do n't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors . we 'll pray to find you some honest work .

mary clarence , could you ? mary lazarus , you 're terrific , but ... could you help us ?

is n't it a glorious morning ? good morning , mary clarence . sleep well ?

of course . i 'm a nun . four popes now . the lord hates a loafer .

mary robert .

what ?

but the lord came to me

wait , this is n't the way . who are you ?

we could have been killed ! but you saved me ! thank you , mary clarence !

experience !

i have to do this . so i can become a nun .

bobs

of course ! we must do it ! it 's the will of god ! what is it ?

what ?

three years . sister .

very well . i hold you responsible for all of this , for introducing a lounge act into my convent . for utterly disrupting our way of life . and for placing all of us in mortal danger . thank-you .

a part of what ? mary clarence , it is one thing to rabble rouse , to sweep into town and declare a holiday . you have raised the sisters ' expectations , you have excited and confused them . they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party .

i must go where i can be of use .

the majority has spoken .

of course . mary clarence , a convent is not a totalitarian state . most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole . a membership that , i am certain , will vote in a rational and pious manner . all those in favor of allowing mary clarence to select a program ?

not the choir , please , anything but that . the choir -- i mean , have you heard them ? i 'll do anything , scrub floors , toilets , you name it , but not that i

but you ca n't kick me out ! guys want to kill me ! you 're a nun ! a big nun ! are n't you supposed to have compassion ? for the wayward sheep ? i mean , i 'm a major sinner ! all-time great ! hall of fame ! are n't i , like , your dream come true ? your olympic event ?

i do n't believe we have anything to say to each other .

sometimes it 's not enough !

come , sister .

what 's wrong with my life ?

right . so what do we do now ? ping- pong ? row over to the monastery ?

our lives are simple . we have little need for material possessions .

a what ?

what ?

oh my god . this is n't happening , tell me this is n't happening . it 's a nightmare , i 'm back at st. anne 's !

that 's my real name ! currently i 'm a singer . sort of .

what is your full name ? your christian name ?

what ?

does she know people are trying to kill me out there ?

keeping our witnesses alive . we hide them , but there 's a leak in the department , and they end up dead .

pray .

but vince has contacts all over the place ! this is san francisco ! they 'll be looking for me !

it 's a convent . all you have to do is shut up , behave yourself , and get along .

what 're you gon na do , put me in a bag and bury me ?

and if i do n't ?

screw you !

you could n't believe it ? vince the prince ?

i used to buy.you , ..stuff . on your birthday . when we were seeing each other .

i would n't even tell the pope .

they open a window .

a nun ?

who are you guys ?

joey ?

get her !

it did n't work , vince .

but , vince , how do you know she did n't like , join up and become a nun when she was in that convent ?

that 's what i figured , too .

but how do we get there ?

it 's so beautiful ...

i 'd rather sing than do anything !

which convent was that , sister ?

is this like your old convent ?

calm down . think clearly . mary robert , do you have any idea who those men were ?

but , bishop ...

are you nuts ? she 's not a nun . it 's christy . she 's a babe !

can you hold ? can you try ?

how did you hear this ?

excuse me , gentlemen , but ... who has seen this horseman ?

no clotting or gathering of pus . no healing at all .

you will stay at her side ?

bring him .

you need to sleep .

i do not care . you are welcome to use my work area , but i beg you ... return her to her resting place .

the lenape . he comes to gawk at civilization from time to time .

what are you spying on ?

i am the lord 's voice in this town .

your superiors are two days away !

damn ... damn ... damn ...

chosen me ?

not liberalism . equanimity .

master crane , sir . i 'm glad we have time alone . you 've been told plenty about the horseman , i 'm certain .

how are you ?

nothing . to hell with this place and all the people here .

she 's the one who controlled the horseman , is n't she , sir ? sir ?

no . they are all missing .

often in such cases , property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to . and , who in this town is owed a great many debts ?

in test ... what ?

no one yet , far as i can tell . it has gone intestate .

my father had farm land . it was the only thing we owned of any value .

what happened ?

witches do not exist . however ...

where are we going ?

how could he ?

no . get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump .

what was that ?

where are we going ?

speak the words , constable . what is stopping you ? what has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality ?

what would you have me believe ?

it is only me .

lady van tassel ... she is your stepmother , is n't she ? she bears so little resemblance .

the things i said to you before ... i was wrong to say them .

and this gives worth to butchery ?

you promised justice .

you are funny .

is it me , or are you this nervous around all women ?

forgive me , i did n't know .

you ... you are alive .

she is guilty .

well , yeah it 's a classic . you know , karl , i got to thinkin ' about it last night and it 's just not christian of me to not let you have a key . i mean you been in lockup so long , you do n't need me keepin ' you locked up . you need to come and go as you please . here , take this key , it 'll get you in and out that back door . them french fries good ?

you done fixed it ? i 'll be damned . scooter told me it could n't be fixed . 'course scooter 's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be . you done fixed it . i 'll just be damned . see you tomorrow .

all right then . i 'll see you bright and early . how you comin ' along on that garden tiller ?

all right then .

yeah , me too .

okay , stop back by . do n't worry about your boy here , he 's doin ' good .

can i see him ?

good to know you , karl .

no , do n't guess i do . scooter , good to meet you . this is him , the one i talked to you about on the phone . now like i said , i 'll understand if you get nervous about it . i 'm not gon na lie to you now , he did get in that trouble but then he was real young .

hey jerry , how it 's goin ' . good to see you . been a long time .

karl 's my name .

yeah .

french-fried potaters .

french fries . i like to eat them pretty good .

what do you like to eat here ?

well , i guess it 's all good .

did you decide , sir ?

you have any biscuits for sale ?

it 's too big .

i bet you did . i was never bent that way . i 'm bent the other way . so , you liked it out there in the world .

what in the goddamn hell are you doin ' ? it 's the middle of the night .

you know what i told you , you even think of leavin ' me , i 'll kill you dead as a doornail .

but honey , i 'll be good . i promise . i love you sweetie . i 'm just tryin ' to help these two be part of things .

you know what we ought to do tonight ?

who could eat with him settin ' there makin ' that goddamn racket with his throat .

see , you made him somethin ' . hey vaughan , i was just goin ' on with you , jokin ' around , buddy .

you 're not crippled . get in there and make somethin ' .

i told you to get away from here , did n't i ? i 'm tryin ' to relax and look at tv . what are you doin ' with that piece of iron ? i swear to god you 're the weirdest son of a bitch i ever heard of .

pick up the fuckin ' phone and call 'em , i guess .

will ye do somethin ' for me if i ast you to ?

i 'm tired , too , frank . if i ai n't around no more , it do n't mean i do n't care fer ye . i care for ye a good deal . i care for you more than anybody they is . we made friends right off the bat .

that feller 's a whole sight meaner than me . he 'd just whup the tar out of me .

you 're just a boy . you ort not to use that sort of language .

it do n't matter to me about us losin ' does it to you ?

yessir .

you will ? for sure ?

i 've studied about it . the bible says not to or you end up goin ' to hades . some folks calls it hell , i call it hades .

that makes me feel real sad . could n't you have done somethin ' , karl ? i would have . i wish i would of had him . he 'd be here right now . livin ' .

it was still alive when you buried it ?

well , i hate him .

i growed up and got taught it ai n't right to kill nobody .

i thought they was .

two people .

why did he do that , reckon .

naw . did n't have too much . enough to scrape by on , i reckon .

well , anyhow , i was just fixin ' to go see my mama down at ben 's dollar store . she 's workin ' two till eight .

why 'd you live there ?

we 've had a real hard life , too , mama .

did vaughan go home ?

that grass out in the yard 's all growed up . i figured i might cut it fer ye .

are you sure you 're okay staying with that woman and boy ?

well , you have to learn . it 'll take some time . do n't you know anybody down there to help you out ?

you better go get your things .

was that you ? i remember that . i was only three or four , but i always heard about it growin ' up . they say you 're well ?

vaughan 's `` friend '' will be there , too . he works at the funeral home . and frank . you know frank likes you a lot . he says you make him feel calm .

i did n't aim to .

what about you , karl ? do you want to stay here ?

okay , karl , the reason i brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind . i guess i 'll put it right out on the table . where do i start . linda and frank are very important to me . they 're like family . my own family was never like family . they 're horrible people . as a matter of fact i prayed every night for years that my father would die . i finally realized through a lot of therapy that i was wasting my energy on hating him . now i just do n't care . you see , you and i are a lot alike , strange as that may seem . i mean not physically or even mentally really , just well , maybe emotionally or actually the hand we 've been dealt in life . we 're different . people see us as being different anyway . you 're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and i , well mine 's not as easy to see . i 'm just going to say it . i 'm gay . does that surprise you ? that i 'm gay . you know what being gay is , do n't you ?

i reckon mr. woolridge got me hired on to work for bill cox 's outfit .

naw , i do n't believe you have . i do n't reckon i never been in here . this store did n't used to be here .

are you sure it 's safe to let him around that guy ?

it 's the best you 're gon na get . i 'm sorry .

no thank you .

i think everybody at the store knows that already . they always talk about it . maureen ledbetter told a awful story about why you ai n't allowed over at the first baptist church no more .

yes .

well , a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors . unfortunately , i have to keep certain parts of my life private .

like me , too .

good . then may i have the honor of extending an invitation to you ?

it 's coming along . at the rate he 's going , he 'll have a story finished by the end of the summer .

good . i hope you like it . it was a long time in coming .

almost done . a week or ten days , and i 'll be there .

it looks worse than it is . i 'm okay .

melville , huh ? it 's been a while .

wow . you do n't fool around , do you ?

american literature . what else ?

i confess .

better make it charge .

i would n't say that . but at least you 've put the camera to good use .

i guess so . i never thought of it that way .

yeah , probably .

okay . you remember how you once asked me how i started taking pictures ? well , this is the story of how i got my first camera . as a matter of fact , it 's the only camera i 've ever had . are you following me so far ?

ready . any time you are .

yeah , great . the problem is , i have four days to come up with something , and i do n't have a single idea . you know anything about christmas stories ?

two , right ?

it 's tommy 's . the sucker owed me a favor .

so what did he say when he called ?

or did n't . there 's no way of knowing , is there ?

you have n't heard from rashid , have you ?

fuckus my assus . they did some number on you .

he 's crazy .

if he 's got something to tell me , why do n't he tell it to me himself ?

they 're all the same .

i 'd like to see your pictures some day .

you run out of schimmelpennincks ?

for keeps ?

five thousand bucks .

why do n't you open it and find out ?

are you calling me a liar ? i 'm telling you i 'm broke . i do n't even have insurance on my goddamned car .

no you 're not .

yeah ? and what else am i supposed to do ? there 's no baby anymore , and if she wants to throw away her life , that 's her business .

relax , okay ? you do n't have to do anything . just go in there and pretend . it wo n't kill you to do a little favor like that . besides , you might even learn something .

i think you 'd better stop the car and let me out .

and that 's how felicity came into the picture . during one of those two seconds .

talk away , lady of my dreams . i 'm all ears .

it 's the law that 's buying . that 's what 's so beautiful about it . i mean , when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail ?

no problem , vinnie . everything 's under control . i could run this store in my sleep .

what do you care where it comes from ? it 's yours .

for me ? and what am i supposed to do with a paper bag ?

good . keep it up , and maybe one day you 'll grow up and become a great man like me .

that 's how it is with sidewalks . people come , people go , and they all drop shit on the ground . as soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next , the first spot is dirty again .

forty-four . they 're on special this week from the canary islands . a real bargain .

well , one thing i suppose , but i do n't think it has anything to do with this . a friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she 'd spotted thomas 's father working at some gas station outside of peekskill .

look , lady , that 's enough . if you do n't calm down . i 'm going to throw you out . do you hear me ? right now !

well , whatever his name is , he 's not here anymore . he left two days ago , and i have n't heard from him since .

thomas ? who 's thomas ?

what can i do for you ?

that boy 's one in a million . a real tiger .

i do n't mean to be nosy , but i was wondering what happened to your arm .

it was just a thought .

what do you want me to say ?

okay , joke about it . i do n't give a shit .

you still have that watch auggie gave you ?

do n't worry about it . you 've got friends now , remember ? just behave yourself , and everything will work out .

you 'll do it , all right . you fuck up , you 've got to undo the damage . that 's how it works , buster . if you do n't do it , i 'm going to throw you out of here . do you understand me ? if you do n't pay auggie what you owe him . i 'm finished with you .

and started to run .

no way .

yeah , right . the inspiration . it 's a true story anyway , so i do n't suppose it can hurt , can it ?

the inspiration .

thanks .

cut it out , will you ? just cut it out and come back here .

absolutely . the world is my oyster . whatever that means .

and how long did i tell you you could stay ?

the world is going to end pretty soon if you do n't learn fast . look , why not make yourself useful ? i 'm just about out of smokes . go around the corner to the brooklyn cigar company and buy me two tins of schimmelpenninck medias .

i 'm a teenager . all teenagers are clumsy . it 's because we 're still growing . we do n't know where our bodies end and the world begins .

he 's dead ?

it 's strange , though , is n't it ? looking at yourself before you knew who you were .

i listen on the radio . i can see the games just fine that way . the world is in your head , remember ?

people do n't do that kind of thing . not in new york .

well , maybe just one . to be polite .

rashid . rashid cole .

i owe you something .

i just happened to be there . the right place at the right time .

medium rare , please .

keep it tonight . we 'll catch fish . i 'll see ya back on the docks ...

... or from the cut on his hand . which is more probable ?

well , if the blood got < u > onto < /u > the gaff by crushing a man 's skull ...

what do you mean by 'dirty looks ' ?

now if you wanted to kill a man . think you 'd try boarding against his will , and hitting him with a fishing gaff ?

up in the air ? was < u > that < /u > your reaction ?

so , then , you ... and your husband ... must have called friends , relatives , to tell them the amazing news . yes ?

look , i < u > want < /u > to forget you , i do . i think if you hold me , just this once , i can walk away and never speak to you again .

i 'm sorry about your arm . kabuo and i. are very sor ...

my mom . would be the problem .

your friends would . your dad would kill me with a machete .

i told myself that was good . that it made our friendship special . and did n't mean she was ashamed of it . necessarily .

at school , she kept mostly to the japanese kids , and sort of ignored me . as if all of our times alone together ... in the hollow cedar , everywhere ... were a secret .

he 's still got a good grip . we need to dig more .

those are n't the facts that matter .

you 've been busy with that trial , i suppose . such a travesty ...

... comes off third cleat from the stern , port side . and it 's brand new . unlike the rest .

japanese stick-fighting . they 're trained as kids , y'know . to kill with sticks .

well , i was a doctor in the jap theater , in the war . i saw those kendo wounds , < u > many < /u > times . looked exactly like this one .

... so when the sheriff returned , you showed him the injury to the deceased 's head .

you 're a hard man to trust , sir . you sit before us , with no expression , keeping a poker f ...

but is n't the < u > truth < /u > that there are < u > several < /u > other ways to explain < u > each < /u > of these twelve pieces .

yes . initially .

do n't prove there was two lanterns . coulda been the one in the cabin .

wo n't take two .

you said three minutes .

well . it shows the prosecutor was wrong . it was < u > carl 's < /u > boat that was dead in the water . or he 'd never have put up the lantern .

this tastes horrible , hmmn ?

what for , sheriff ?

now this jury is gon na be lookin ' at the evidence with one eye . and at you with the oth ...

you would n't even see it move .

sure . i could take a fishing gaff and split your head open . right above your left ear .

what else could it be ?

possible . but not darn likely .

is it possible his head struck the transom , or the stern gunnel , or the net roller , as you were bringing him in ?

it is .

i already said that , b ...

you can speak for what he < u > said < /u > . just like you did for mr. hooks ...

... he used to say , `` if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . ''

bye .

i suppose you want a tip ?

a what ?

now cut that out , girls-none of that rough talk . they went to a conservatory .

thank you ever so .

you 're in berths 7 and 7a .

cut it out , girls . stop it . joe - josephine - help !

it 's private . go away .

stop , or i 'll burst out crying .

all right - so what do we do now ?

there you go with that we again .

i tell you , joe , they 're on to us . they 're going to line us up against the wall and - eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames , and they 're going to take us to the ladies ' morgue , and when they undress us - i tell you , joe , i 'm just going to die of shame .

what ?

like what are you going to do on your honeymoon ?

but you 're not a girl . you 're a guy ! and why would a guy want to marry a guy ?

what are you talking about ? you ca n't marry osgood .

and i 'm not even pretty .

i just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive . there 'll be no buzzing around tonight .

i changed it . it used to be sugar kowalczyk .

tore off one of my chests .

who are we kidding ? look at that - look how she moves - it 's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor . i tell you it 's a whole different sex .

how can they walk on these things ? how do they keep their balance ?

i think they got me .

all the way to urbana - for a one night stand ?

do n't you remember ? he has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -

with me ?

hey , joe !

what are you worried about ? this job is going to last a long time .

he 's going to south america to marry some other girl - that 's what they call high finance .

yeah . this is one for ripley .

okay .

you 're so flat-chested . clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me .

oh , i have some suntan lotion .

no fair guessing .

what did you say ?

that 's ridiculous .

it 's nothing . i just think us girls should stick together .

are my seams straight ?

she sings , too .

you 're the wrong shape . goodbye .

the florida job ?

we 'll adopt some .

goodbye , mr. fielding .

my last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know , sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - zowie ! - but mama broke it up .

sorry . i 'll be on the bandstand .

me too . bye now .

do n't i know you two from somewhere ?

nellie baby , i 'll make it up to you .

we got it second-hand .

would you mind rejoining the living ? goose it up a little .

well , here we are .

i know . every time !

you 'll forget him , sugar .

what 's the matter , sugar ?

you 're not ?

lets throw another log on the fire .

would you like a little more champagne ? and maybe if we had some music - - how do you dim these lights ?

what is it ?

how can you think about food at a time like this ?

you poor , poor boy .

talk about sad .

they shrink when they 're marinated .

three ?

i just got this motorboat - it 's an experimental model .

it 's sort of funny - you being out of gas - i mean , shell oil and everything -

i seem to be out of gas .

one of whom ?

shell oil ?

- riding to hounds -

well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel . sweet sue and her society syncopators .

that must be it .

your face is familiar .

who are you ?

well , do n't worry . i wo n't sue you - no matter who you are .

saxophone player ?

want to switch berths with me ?

yeah . with money like rockefeller , and shoulders like johnny weismuller -

you 're entitled .

you do n't know what they 're like . you fall for them and you love 'em - you think it 's going to be the biggest thing since the graf zeppelin - and the next thing you know they 're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -

that so ?

sugar , you 're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble .

i play the ukulele . and i sing too .

show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three .

sorry , sir , we only serve coffee .

you and who else ?

you 're wasting the taxpayers ' money .

refresh my memory .

hey .

so tony pee-pants starts ignoring kat . he wanted to play with me .

im fine . i promise .

i should get going .

so dad rang the bell and when tony pee-pants opened the door , i threw the tart at him and popped his stitches .

id be happy to . youre welcome .

i thought you said you were crap .

you are taking the piss ?

i didnt deserve her back then .

whats his problem ?

sorry , can you give us a moment ?

crikey .

ah , a philosopher .

well , we had a lot of good years , but then ...

maybe not her least ... theres always --

yeah ?

yeah ! for all i know , come monday morning , well go back to the real world and ... and youll be hiring me for your best friend !

i didnt say he was worth it .

yeah .

sure , but its never easy . they say theyre okay with it , and they are ... for a while . then one day , theyre not .

are you asking me if im gay for pay ?

i have a different story for every woman who asks . i look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me .

your friend guaranteed my anonymity .

well , happen , in the sense that i picked up the phone , tracked you down , flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401k .

you stand on your tiptoes .

what ?

graham russell and russell hitchcock .

im desperate to start but i dont have an addictive personality . except for approval . that , i cant get enough of .

great , with the occasional stabs of shame . now , listen , this covers the weekend , but as we discussed , if you want to be intimate , we talk money before anything happens .

i dont know .

of course he is . im here with my new man . i love it ! your magics already working . let the suffering begin .

love .

you know , they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked .

really ? dont get too attached .

you think we look like were trying too hard .

its complicated , dad .

so whyd you let him go ?

i havent thought about that in years .

best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass --

what do you say to that ?

what would you say if i told you i was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource : your daughter .

nothin ' ...

what do i tell my mama when i get home ? i did n't find him and that 's what i wanted to do .

i have a mother and her name is rebecca -- my father 's name is nathan lee morgan , and ...

what he talk 'bout ?

let me see it ...

: his mother , with her head thrown back , her eyes aglitter and laughing .

thank you , daddy ...

daddy , you home now ... that 's all i want -- i do n't want nothin ' else ...

into the clouds and behind the mountains .

where was you , daddy ?

son , that was some trip you went on ...

you learnin ' anything at that school ?

never heard of 'im . we got ta lotta men here ...

yes , ma'am ... ?

david !

act like one !

be good and be smart , little boy .

but you 'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes , where will you sleep ? i ca n't send you away from here like that !

david , come back here !

what do they do in the white churches , mama ?

hello , david ...

i 'm used to it .

no , he was wrong , david , i did n't find out .

thank you , miss boatwright !

and if they saw me pitch the way i did today -- they 'd hire me just to strike out babe ruth !

why do n't you pay him a visit , mr. howard ? he 'll tell you all about it .

where you goin ' ! ?

i see , all right -- it 's time for us to get out of this field .

you sure you feel up to it , nathan ?

to invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree , drink ice cold whiskey , and just shoot the breeze !

the most important thing is that you 're home ! we was gon na have cold eatin ' tonight , 'cause of the heat , but now , i 'm goin ' to cook !

hope it do n't freeze out our baseball game today !

good mornin ' , nathan .

what we make it to ? the next season to work ourselves to death , share croppin ' for ol ' man howard , so he can get richer and we ca n't even eat when the croppin ' time is done ?

i bet you could use a hot cup of coffee , nathan lee .

it 's not that simple , sister rebecca -- the lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin ' and we 'll leave it with nothing .

i got to see my husband , sheriff young !

pillow .

do n't worry about that . now , i want you to say 'doggy . '

patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip ...

why the fuck not ?

fragile ?

eric ! did you just say the `` f '' word ?

that book was n't canadian !

they 're burning all the canadian stuff cause of the war .

about what ?

i know cartman , i know . i see kenny every day .

tell 'em we 'll have pie and punch .

and she 's getting worse ...

dude , they cut out 92 minutes !

yeah , i 'm having total deja vu right now . like this has all happened before ...

come on , cartman . it 's not your fault .

mph rmprmmh rm ! !

if you went down on a horse ... you 'd tell me , right ?

mom ... when is the war gon na be over ?

no , eric ... i 'm afraid it 's phase two for you ...

the rest of you are graduated . you can go home today .

mkay , you see , children . this is exactly what i 'm talking about . we have to change the way you think .

you 've got a stupid accent too .

mkay , kids from all over the state have been brought here , because you all share the same problem . uh , young man ... let 's start with you .

what was that word , young man ! ?

oops , i guess you have n't got that far in your anatomy class , huh ?

mph rmph rm rmph rm .

mph rm ! ! !

oh , you want out of hell , huh ?

mrph mprhm mm rmph !

dude , what the hell is going on ?

freeze ! !

no , i mean we ca n't leave without you - we do n't know where the hell we are ! !

it 's okay , i am done for .

that 's gon na take a long time !

sweet .

wow !

okay ...

it 's only a matter of time before my mom has him burned too !

i 'm so sick of these soldiers .

what ? what do n't i get ? what do n't i get ?

dude , let 's help terrance and phillip ! !

oh my god ! they killed kenny !

yeah !

yeah , let 's swear we wo n't tell !

she 's not my girlfriend , dude !

yes ! and i will not allow my children to be ruined by smut ! ! i am sorry young man , but i have had it up to here ! strap them in !

i knew this would happen ! those bastard canadians have now killed a child ! ca n't people see the damage that film is doing ? !

not necessary ? ! mr. president , may i remind you that our country 's heart and soul are at stake , and our children 's minds are the battlefield ! the bastard canadians want to fight us because we wo n't tolerate their potty mouths . well , if it is war they want ... then war they shall have ! ! !

oh , uh ... i do n't know if air strikes are necessary .

yes ... and in doing so , you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming .

terrance and phillip are two very untalented , unfunny actors from canada . their tv show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage . now it appears they have a movie and i 'm positive it 's not suitable for children !

alright , i 'll make the call ...

mrs. brovlofski , the v-chip has n't been fully tested yet , it could be dangerous .

how is the children 's progress ?

uh , we 're just , starting our program ...

this little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us ! you are a bad man !

ha ha ha ! you burned yourself to death by lighting the fart ! ha ha ha ! !

well , terrance i hope you learned something from this whole experience .

< b > shut your fucking face ! ! unclefucka ! ! ! you 're the one that fucked your uncle , unclefucka ! ! ! you do n't eat , or sleep or mow the lawn you just fuck your uncle all day long ! < /b >

< b > shut your fucking face , unclefucka ! ! you 're an asslicking , ball sucking unclefucka ! ! you 're an unclefucka , yes it 's true nobody fucks uncles quite like you- < /b >

ow , you 're hurting me !

yup .

did you see that , wendy ?

we saw the terrance and phillip movie !

we 're going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days . dry up into crunchy little pinkies .

bedrock ! i can not dig any further in zis direction !

they 're not going to make it !

anna ...

well i appreciate that .

i hear you mac and i appreciate it . frankly i do n't know what i 'd have done without you on this one .

good help is hard to find ...

will you transmit the distress signal ?

you better start making sense !

well , maybe i will . you sure you do n't want anything ?

uh ...

man , i 'm hungry . i 'm going to call the steward , you want anything ? .

i know , i know .

i would , but no one can perform the ceremony . i guess it does n't matter .

so close ...

i ca n't !

that 's why we need a safe passage . remember what you said earlier , about getting through the wall ? that might just be our ticket .

what do you think 's going to happen to us ?

even if we do , it might be too late .

close every door behind you !

why ca n't we ?

ca n't we access the mainframe to check the ship 's condition ?

well i do n't think there 's a chance of that happening . it 's usually the moon walks . sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher .

yes . theoretical discoveries aside , there 's nothing like the real thing . how about you ?

so i 've been told .

baby , take it easy .

how am i supposed to know ?

yes . you can enjoy some wonderful views from there .

yes i know all that . mac , i need you to help us out with a little technical problem .

paradise , huh ? might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. theo turns to leave .

heh , heh , heh .

see ya 'round faz .

right , eating at the core , eating it 's way out . it makes me sick !

your pop said to put these on his tab . sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door .

buzz , mr. kastle wants to talk to you .

you afraid we 're gon na steal it ?

lem me see your ball .

fazeli ... i do n't know no buzz fazeli .

buzz burger , side of 'cues . you have n't introduced me to your fan .

some people will do anything for an autograph . theo enters the diner and walks over to buzz .

wish me luck .

simple math , buzz . two plus two does not equal three .

and look at that ; both partners go down together . kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor , stands up , and crushes it under his heel . he goes over and puts his arm around buzz .

i did n't mean that stuff i said . i was trying to keep you out of this muddle . i 'm glad i did n't have my tubes tied . oh , and by the way , i made a call for you before i - uh - retired . buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen .

bowling died for me years ago . besides , i 'm a living dead legend . i 'm a hero .

what about bowling ?

i could n't care less .

what makes you so sure it was me ? she coulda had lotsa bowlers ! theo rushes buzz and grabs his arm . the two men struggle for the pin .

you have no right to call yourself a bowler . buzz slaps theo in the face .

theo ! this is sheila kastle , my partner 's daughter .

i ai n't nobody 's father !

where 'd you get this ball ?

they suspended me for 100 years .

i 'm not on the tour this year .

oh sure . let everyone in . from now on i leave the door wide open . let the parade begin !

how 's that ?

i do n't like to talk about it .

who 's there ?

someone wants to play with me ?

that 's some pinfall . almost a 133 average . her ball 's flat , she needs to work on her spin control .

maybe i can help you . try a lighter ball , penelope - you 'll get hurt with that big ball , honey . i 've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit . you got fazeli blood running through you . your pop was a genuine talent in his day .

you might say i 'm at the top of their shit list .

see ! no feeling . tell theo what happened to your hand , junior .

who wants to know ? zeus !

i am a professional man .

your word is so good , you 're never gon na give it to anyone .

when i 'm with you sheila , i do n't even think about bowling . theo takes sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately . she stops him and looks around nervously .

where are you going ?

we would have sooner or later .

it . bouncy-bouncy . fucked . he tried to squeeze my fucking head off . what did you say to him ? when they reach each other , they stop . sheila seems to weigh her answer .

it ?

he 's my father .

yeah , what did buzz fazeli ever do for you ?

come on theo , what about plan c ?

he said he 'd sponsor me .

i do n't know . it 's all i ever wanted to do .

no . not at the present .

i 'd rather you did n't .

uh ... over easy .

... your civil rights have been overridden !

fletcher ! now !

fletcher , get away from there ...

it sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface . but we 've never used it underwater before .

high voltage ?

nobody move .

forgive me . i 've never read the navy manual . i wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures .

back at the door -- i asked you to back away .

hold on --

would you wait a minute ?

back away then .

in basic english , what does all this mean ?

of what we 're able to measure , roughly twenty-six hundred feet .

if something should happen to us , the navy will at least have partial records of what happened .

... it raises a very serious question : < u > what happens if jerry < /u > < u > gets mad < /u > ?

the message does n't show a lack of intelligence . it 's smart . it 's approaching us in a simple way . like you would a dog . holding out your hand , letting it sniff , get used to you .

i 'm afraid it is dr. johnson ... because it 's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor .

extraordinary , is n't it ?

well , we do n't have all the facts yet .

the pentagon ? i did n't know i had friends in washington .

well , where the fuck is he ?

send them , damn it ! i know , but i 'm not gon na be held responsible --

harry ? can you copy ?

well , shit -- find something , do something ... make something up --

thank you , i can see that . try something else .

what ?

she 's not gon na know , sir .

we 're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he ca n't just walk outside !

considered what ? that it 's american ? how would you think it 's american ?

a foot and a half thick ? that 'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation .

some sort of lead or something .

ted , get her away from the door .

nobody goes inside , until we know < u > what 's < /u > inside .

captain , you know , i really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television .

the wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we 've seen .

c'mon --

i know . you 're too strong , beth .

where is it coming from , beth ?

promise what , norman ? tell me !

but i have to , norman .

when you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking ? do you know ? `` i ca n't get beth on the radio . i 'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean . all alone . surrounded by all this water . '' was it really the squid that was attacking you , norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears ? you never really saw what it was , did you ?

that 's bullshit .

if i was , then i would 've had to have gone in the sphere , would n't i ?

only lab rats . here .

does n't say .

bingo .

his dream ? you ca n't control your dreams . and you ca n't control your fears , can you ?

i do n't know , beth . i 'm not the fucking alien that built the thing . but it can . when harry came out of the sphere , he mumbled something about page 87. how he would never read that far -- he was too scared to . then you found the book , remember in your lab . then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid ...

i do n't know .

but how ?

squids ?

page 87 .

all i know is i opened that refridgerator --

none of this was here before .

still clear ?

you press a button , norman . it 's not brain surgery . here , go ahead . you only have 15 minutes to reset it . go on , norman ...

do n't bother me , norman .

yeah , okay . sure , norman .

you 're jumping to conclusions , beth . do n't get worked up --

what about you ? what happened to you ?

no , thank you . i hate jellyfish .

it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas .

the timing has never seemed quite right .

because when we get down there --

do yourself a favor , norman . are you listening ? do n't tell anyone what you just told me .

i 'm a woman . i do n't theorize . i only deal with facts .

pussy .

why are you looking at me like that ?

you 'd have to ask them .

it 's empty . why would someone build a ship like this ?

all that banging and pounding . i do n't know . we should think about making a good first impression .

nine hundred feet to surface .

push her , c'mon .

we 're never gon na make it .

did i kill her ?

is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag ?

i thought she was with you .

i ca n't breathe ... am i ... clear ?

harry ?

i do n't remember much . it 's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but i ca n't taste any of it . funny , my senses are much keener though . purer . hearing , seeing , smelling . like , i can smell your sheets , norman . you tried to wash it out earlier , but i can still smell the urine . do n't worry , i 'm not going to tell the others . it 's normal , really , is n't it ? in a crisis . the stress . the panic .

getting anywhere with those ?

these are n't half bad , fletcher . you might have a second career coming .

tell me about the door . do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere ? ... harry ?

harry , can you tell me about the sphere ?

am i ?

i ca n't . if i had a minute to think , maybe , but i know you 're wrong .

good point . i do n't know what you 're talking about , but good point .

this spacecraft was designed to pick things up . they see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in . they come across this . this ... < u > sphere < /u > . find it interesting , curious . they draw it inside to take back home .

this answers one of our questions .

thank you .

it did n't fly here . it < u > arrived < /u > here .

shutup , ted . you did n't notice shit . keep hammering .

norman thinks we should n't be going down . thinks it 's a mistake .

the ships ?

it 's over , sir , the storm has cleared .

does this mean what i think it means ?

this way , sir .

must be another johnson then . been flying so many scientists out here -- ca n't keep everyone straight .

it 's not some fucking substitution code , it 's a direct visual representation .

you want me to try ?

we 'll be back before you are , old man .

... and i want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments .

all right then , we 'll use your plan .

a million at least ... if this robot has information related to the destruction of organa major , you 'll be able to name the reward ...

i did n't say that , but it appears to be a logical alternative .

what is it ?

all you have to do is lose your thinking self . do n't focus on anything . let your body do your thinking ... you have to learn to act on what you feel , not what you think ... if i had the crystal , it would be much easier . you could feel the force immediately ... but for now , let yourself go . you 'll pick it up ... and someday you 'll have no need for that pistol either .

these are doubtful times . the empire has grown bold in its disregard of the ...

i had one , but it was taken at the battle of condawn ...

when a creature dies , the force it generated remains . the force is all around us . it can be collected and transmitted through the use of a kiber crystal . it 's the only way to amplify the power of the force within you .

how can you store an energy field within you ?

you mean i generate an energy field ?

let 's just say the force is something a jedi warrior deals with . it is an energy field in oneself , a power that controls ones acts , yet obeys ones commands . it is nothing , yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes . all living things generate this force field , even you .

you were right . it is my responsibility . the force of others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me .

i know that .

i 'll tell you , luke , and this is between you and me . the star force is n't all it 's cracked up to be . frankly , it 's a bore , and it 's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral ...

yes , sir , but i can get him ...

yes , sir .

send out a boarding party . full assault gear .

alert squad five , but hold them until we know what it is .

i have little time for your mercenary concerns , but i am grateful for the service you have given to our cause . what is your price ?

the fourth moon of yavin . i 've given the coordinates to chewbacca .

chewbacca , it 's time we showed them this is n't the regulation f8-88 cargo trawler .

there are only three or four left .

thanks , old buddy . i 'll be with you in a second .

watch it ! move back .

not if this tunnel deadends .

maybe you should just drop us off . i 'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk .

you ca n't ! we 've come this far . we must find them ...

i found it ... it 's just not there .

it 's automatic .

who 's the pilot ?

i ... i do n't know . i guess i never thought about it ... i just want to help . i want to be in on the attack . i want my own ship .

are there medical facilities on yavin ?

what is it ? what 's going on ? where are we ?

but you promised ! i 've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised !

let him have it . you 're winning anyway . it does n't make any difference .

what happened ? i 'm sorry , sir , i must have taken a bad step ...

well , i do n't know what to do now . we 'll just have to head inland and see if we ca n't find a settlement .

down there on the flats , eh ? listen up , roughnecks ! our primary objective is to assist our friends from the fleet ...

what do i want with a scar ?

you made squad leader on your own , and , hey , you still got me to kick around .

well , maybe you better look again .

what makes you think ... you 'll make ... squad leader , rico ?

i got games & theory .

passport to the universe . who would n't want that ?

just giving you something to remember me by , baby .

please , i ... everybody 's lost someone by now . this should n't be any different ...

there ! gravity field ... it 's big !

where is it ?

three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all , huh ?

everyone is going to the dance . are n't you ?

almost got knocked out of the sky over big k .

you look so ... i do n't know , you look like you 've really been in it .

i 'm not , but alot of my soldiers are . glass the planet !

i 'll go for that .

everyone 's looking ... we should n't ...

eeuch !

i bought the farm , did n't i , johnny ?

they ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy .

way to go , amigo !

hey , they humiliated me in front of everyone ! i 'm just supposed to take it , huh ? well , i 'm not gon na , and i guess that proves i just ca n't cut it .

what ? you think i joined the mobile infantery because of you ?

sure .

you still gon na play for brazil ?

hey , rico , wan na dance ?

it 's not really working out for me here , dad . i was thinking ... i was hoping it would be alright if i came home .

good , because you 're going to harvard , and that 's the end of it .

a lot of my friends are doing federal service ...

bugs do n't lay traps ... they are n't intelligent ! unlike you , they 're stupid enough to follow orders !

sounds more like some idiot at military intelligence command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed ...

no talking please . i 'm going to ask you some questions . please answer all questions truthfully . we 'll know if you do n't . birthplace ?

let 's get some armor on her , and the we 'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !

yeah , that 's right .

that would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective . they hang you for that , rico .

we 're outa here . lieutenant , get your men into the skimmers . this real estate 's about to go buggy .

i get it . this is the part that 's best for both of us . do n't do me anymore favors , eh ?

best in the fleet !

sergeant , secure the boat !

uni high tigers , sir . do n't you remember ? i was captain of the team .

mister rasczak ?

v'ger is that which seeks the creator .

why does v'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead ?

that is how v'ger will survive .

yes .

mr. scott ... on my next signal .

sir ! airlock four has been opened ; a thruster suit is reported missing !

and plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this ... ... point here , captain . it should pick up even a tricorder playback .

captain ... i 'd like to go along ...

that thing is twenty hours from earth . we know nothing about it yet .

mr decker ... .

... but i still recommend further simulation study .

you are what ... ?

forward motion , captain ... !

we have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in < u > precise < /u > detail . suppose that beneath its programming , the real ilia 's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision .

wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems ... !

negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed .

decker ... . !

time to impact ... ?

why are n't the enterprise transporters in operation , mister scott ?

high mag , mr. sulu !

it would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information . a remarkably efficient system .

answers to what , spock ? our dilemma -- or your < u > personal < /u > one ?

i am seeking answers , captain .

get someone up here to take the navigator 's station ... ! engineering ... full emergency power !

i intend to be there following that meeting . report to me . one hour !

why are n't you on board ?

based , i am told , on your recommendation , admiral . thank you .

we 're ready , sir .

starfleet has been apprised of our situation , captain .

mom 's expecting you for dinner tonight .

and come to the printshop . you know < u > why < /u > ... ?

... well , we do that < u > anyway < /u > ...

it does ?

how 's your star ?

she < u > realizes < /u > -- it was not the fire which < u > hurt < /u > him ... that the < u > true < /u > hurt was her . was her ...

i hurt you ?

you believe that ?

because i 'd met someone else .

oh , god ...

`` rise , one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice . ''

uh huh .

the < u > firehouse < /u > ...

that 's why you did n't want to take the < u > mill < /u > out ... you 've ...

mister white is ...

yes ...

that 's what the swing is < u > there < /u > for ...

... that it has been vouchsafed to him .

... that ... he < u > sees < /u > that ...

no , of course , you do n't want to talk about it .

could you tell me when 's the next train ?

why ?

why did you quit ?

you wrote a play on it , what play is that ?

the people in new hampshire .

i was n't doing business .

we had a date .

doug , this is joe white , and this is , this , this is my fiance , doug mac ...

annie : you stick to the amateur theatricals . this is n't quite the same thing , you see ? this is big business , in which , our life ... ... s'no less a < u > commodity < /u > than ... than our ...

we missed you in church today , frank .

how 'd you like working with richard hill ?

you want to see it better , we could go out on the roof .

nice town that you 've got here .

then i hope you would n't tell anyone that i gave you this .

how old are you ?

sure , what have you got ?

can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece ?

how could she turn on me like that ? i thought she liked me .

so you see what i 'm < u > saying < /u > ... the movie is about < u > purity < /u > ...

< u > bobby < /u > ...

bob , bob , stick to the business , will you ?

we 've got three days to ...

thanks , honey , but , next time , bring two , save yourself a trip .

the mayor 's outside .

there 's other things to be learned .

we know that you were n't .

nobody touched me , i was at home .

cool it , babe , you started this ...

i want to tell you something , wally , he 's a pussycat . < u > my < /u > thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and i have to do that . now : what is this you want < u > eight hundred thousand dollars < /u > to do what you 're being paid to , you already < u > signed < /u > you 'd do ... ? what is that ?

< u > you < /u > know ... where 's your bathroom ?

no , are you kidding me , bob , not at all .

well , joe said it , and he 's right .

what ? i have a five-o'clock plane to catch .

... and my heart goes out to you , because i know ...

i know , it 's the hardest thing in the world , and it seems everybody wants ...

she does n't want to bare her breasts ... what , in the `` nude scene ... ? '' what are we paying her three mil ?

i ca n't tell .

that is n't very nice .

... he 's the producer of the movie .

oh , you 're his attorney , too ... ?

he saw the girl in the car ...

you should .

no . no , but we 're planning to .

my < u > wife 's having a baby < /u > ...

oh , that 's < u > great < /u > . let 's bring more people into this overcrowded world .

you 're very sorry , you passive aggressive , son-of-a-bitch ... can we replace him ?

get mitch cohn on the phone in new york , tell him she 's breaking her contract and we 're very up ...

it burnt down .

i 've got a date .

i know you are . go you huskies .

i do n't drink .

i was in new hampshire . i was at the old location .

does it have to be an old mill ? where have you been ?

i can write it . i ca n't type it .

you swore . you owe me a quarter . did you remember my egg carton ? i told you i needed my egg carton for seed planting today .

there 's worse things .

fine .

oh my god . that is so not funny . you 're late . you 're really late . now get out here and have some cereal .

right here . right here . < u > inside < /u > the magician . shhhh .

so what do you think we 're gon na talk about ?

okay . these are good .

how do you know ?

that 's rache 's song !

i 'm still sick , but i 'm better .

i have cancer . do you know what that is ?

mommy 's sick , guys .

if you want me to hate her i will .

what honey ?

no , that 's your fault . it 's her fault for not watching over my precious son , as if it were her priority . which means , the most important job .

ben ! oh my ben ! are you alright ?

at first . then , after awhile , some chemo .

congratulations . only forty minutes late . you 're handling this promotion really well rachel .

i live or i die .

i know . i would n't know what to say . if it were you .

you want us to take him tonight ? give you some private time with annab ... .

it 's good . you 're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us , are you ?

just not to me .

jackie stop . we promised we never go there .

what 's this about ? because we < u > fought < /u > ?

double .

right down to the ground . let 's get to it .

actually . they 'll want annabelle 's mother .

looks nice enough to m ...

yes . i made the choice that was right for me . and i do n't regret it . but even for me , there were days when i felt so lost , so invis- ible . and then i 'd hate myself for the kids not being enough .

it 's < u > covered < /u > , okay ? i appreciate your concern . can i talk to her ?

how 's she doing with brad ?

as you may know , 'going out ' in the six grade does n't mean shit . they do n't actually < u > go < /u > to a movie or anywhere , they do n't even eat lunch together , it 's just a declaration to the world that they 're ...

they came out of my < u > body < /u > !

luke . ca n't live like that .

look , you 've never liked me ...

you what ?

you 're not working at random house , i talked to them .

i do n't know wh ...

it 's okay , it 's twenty minutes . the horse 'll be there .

do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can i finish ?

you mean for you . a 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family . she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time . and you think it 's best for her if every- one pretends it did n't happen ? this is n't going to work out .

did you or luke talk to her about it afterwards ?

maybe you could back off just a little bit --

we do n't have any coffee .

'but keep dancing , and if you 're lucky , i might just never leave , who knows ? '

okay ... is that the good thing or the bad thing ?

i think so ... what do you think ?

hey , i sold my body to satan to clear friday at two o'clo ...

not yet .

it 's complicated for jackie . it 's complicated for me ... you do n't have kids -- you do n't understand --

look . i know they hate me .

i know how responsible , caring adults parent children . i 'm bribe 'em . but 'em a dog or something . maybe a doberman .

but ? but what ?

i did n't want to spoil our supper ...

well , it was n't a reduction like you do it ! boiling down half a ton of bones ...

it was a veal stock , i thi ...

in seven years jackie 's never missed one of tucker 's parties . where is she ?

no prob . i 'm cool .

even though it was only his cousins that were killed ?

well , technically your zeda is a survivor .

jesus was not bad .

he 's dead .

gee , i did n't even know you had any children . but why are you so upset about jesus ?

mi jesusmi jesus

but it 's not like real work . this is just babysitting .

this is work .

it was god 's will .

ok , then we can invite serious intellectual types .

i mean , why are you making this documentary if you ca n't treat your subject with appropriate gravity ?

this is entertainment you 're making , toby . this story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has , with this brady crisis , evolved into something much richer and more provocative .

look , we 're not suckers . everyone else is out there doing the same thing .

well , actually , it 's the same , but longer . i think it 's better . more ... raw .

i think scooby 's like a lot of kids . he just hit aa speed bump . now he 's gon na find his way , his path is gon na be cleared , and i think he 's gon na continue his education at a good college . and everybody else is gon na be happy .

dad , i 'm trying to figure things out right now , ok ? it 's like , really hard , and i 'm just listening to some old elton john and ...

hi , dad !

mikey , there 's optimism , and then there 's stupidity . it 's a very fine line .

thanks .

you have beautiful skin .

all right , scooby , let 's not beat around the bush . with your attitude , you 're not going to get in anywhere .

listen , toby , i ca n't really talk right now . do you mind if i call you back ?

huh . kids ?

hunh .

n-not yet . i 'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers . geez , remember when we were teenagers ?

well , um , i kind of let things go on this novel i 'd been really into - i mean , the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt . i mean , really , it 's finished .

yeah , well , then it got me writing , so that was a good thing .

great !

oh .

he did ?

can i see what you have so far ?

200 verbal/710 math . kinda weird , i know . but i think they thought it was , like , good-weird .

uh-oh ! do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point , or does washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games ?

henry , what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding ?

is he with the girl ?

there is n't anyone ! he 's opened that whole sector now !

i do n't know what hit us ! we had them trapped on the stairwell . they could be anywhere now .

what are you talking about ?

i 'm going first . taking the fire . if we go out together we 're all dead !

no but you did n't defend him either ! did n't want to rock the boat . guess the ride was too smooth . filmore i was acting under legal counsel !

let 's move it we got company !

i 'm not arguing . i 'm just telling you what the deal is -- congresswoman .

i 'll lead .

how 's the arm ?

good ...

you see , it paid off -- you broke away from the old guard , congresswoman . it wo n't be long till they 're calling you senator filmore --

she 's as good as gone ...

well ?

i 'm sure you 'll figure it out .

and -- of course there is the human cost , which is incalculable .

we 've ... been developing a product ... kz 70709 .

surely , you do n't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same ?

that 's nonsense , and you know it !

the food - you would n't put - anything in it , would you ?

you 've wasted enough of my time , fella .

okay , colonel . but look , there 's a pay phone just outside in the hall . maybe that works , huh ? maybe it 'll work ? what do you think ?

then why bother me with this nonsense ? get in touch with the base commander .

general schmuck ?

you are n't sure !

i did n't speak to him , sir . but colonel `` bat '' guano was in command of the special service battalion , so i would imagine he did .

that 's a very wise deduction , general .

yes ?

no , sir . i 'm just bringing the facts to your attention , sir .

are you trying to be insubordinate ?

yes , sir . what 's up , general ripper ?

yes , sir .

go on , major . you fascinate me .

not yet , major . not yet .

you see , major , at this very moment , while we sit and chat , a decision is being made by the president in the war room . he knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes .

do you remember what clemenceau once said about war ?

to peace on earth .

i suppose they are , sir .

and a condition red means enemy attack in progress , does n't it ?

well , just common sense , sir . thirty from thirty-four equals four , or my name 's not `` buck '' schmuck !

how many planes did we lose ?

i want to talk to general ripper .

well , sir , plan-r is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack .

they must have made a visual contact .

we 'll worry about that later . okay , i 'll take damage reports .

they must have been fired from bromdingna - probably one of their new vampire - 202 's . they 've got a range well over a hundred miles .

missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens .

forget it , quentin . it can happen to the best of us . now let 's get squared away .

lieutenant toejam , are you ready for bim and bam ?

that 's what i 'm doing , and it comes out the same .

okay , how do we know they did n't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew ? how do we know that ?

nobody 's loyalty is beyond question . besides , how do we know one of his staff did n't see it ?

i said that 's the point !

then that settles it , does n't it ?

what happened ?

check target approach .

are you saying our order do n't make sense ?

shoot , lothar .

but they could n't come out for a hundred years !

well , what it was ... i , i do n't want to admit it , but , you know , i was jealous of pony .

we were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing . we were getting off on the fact that we 're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest . and i got out and i just started walking .

how long were you in there ?

intense .

mm , in a horizontal and wet way !

pony , what would you say our relationship is ?

well , that 's one way of putting it .

yeah , totally . so , uh , what do they interview you about ?

so you came by to see how the other half lives , huh ? well , here we are , what do you think ? pretty fucking pathetic huh ? kind of like one of those documentaries on educational tv ?

yeah . yeah . yeah , yeah , it 's , you know , it 's a bed and hot water .

come on !

jeff , stay there .

no .

what about my feelings ? what about my fucking feelings ? these assholes , they come over here , they know all the answers , right ? well , they do n't know shit .

they never hurt me ? they hurt me every day with their attitude . you know , like they even have a right . who the fuck do they think they are ? let me tell you something , i was born here . alright ? i 'm an american . and i 'm owed something . look , they took it from me .

no .

wow . you did that for me ?

no , no . that 's not the way it is at all . no , i stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend . wait , yeah , no , i was trying to come up with some lie so that you would n't have to go to jail for the rest of your life .

fuck 'em ! fuck 'em all , man !

to women . they 're all whores . let us not forget what chenowsky said . `` the greatest men are the most alone . '' and without suffering , jeffery , you will never gain wisdom .

yeah , yeah , i stay at the four seas , it 's ease .

you do n't need to sit next to me right now .

yeah , well , he 's from a third world country . he does n't have it easy .

look , why do you care , huh ?

i gave it to you .

what ?

no , no , i have to talk to you .

wait , sooze , i , i have to talk to you , 'cause i , there 's something i figured out .

yeah , uh , that would depend , but yeah . she should .

my goal is to make art .

no one does nothing , jeff .

what feelings ?

did it ever occur to you that i might have some feelings about you moving to new york ?

sooze .

oh , yeah ?

name one .

yes , you asshole .

it 's a piece .

okay , so maybe later .

i know , i know , i know .

w-wait a minute , wait a minute .

i do n't know . uh , i 'm an artist , i guess . you know , there 's life and then there 's the people watching the life , commenting on it .

what do you mean ?

well , i mean , we jammed a couple of times . you know , i mean , you play harmonica , but that was before we were really a band , you know , before danny signed us .

well , i helped start it , but , you know , uh ...

yeah , maybe later . hey ! hey !

really ?

wow . a gold record , man , that 's great . so you 're , you 're like living the wild life now , huh ?

no , it 's not ...

this has nothing to do with me , this , uh , drinking , yeah .

oh , there you are , honey . we were waiting for you . what happened ?

tim , why do n't you shut the fuck up ?

yeah ?

i hate it here . it 's so ugly , it 's like being dead . you got out of here , you know ? i 'm ready to go .

oh , yeah , you 're just so smart .

what 's that supposed to mean ?

soon .

oh , yuck ! oh , gross !

mine too .

`` drove down the highway there was a big jam the family had died there inside their minivan there was a backup it went on for miles but as bad as it was it was gone after a while '' chorus here . `` you may think there 's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see to be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be ''

alright , alright already .

i 'm always serious .

oh , uh , we 're gon na go in the studio and we 're , we 're doin ' a new album .

oh , it 's stupid , is n't it .

your manager ?

well , dad , she said she wanted to suck my cock .

yeah . yeah . how 's the air force , tim ?

just one ?

oh that 's nice for you .

it was the nicest thin i 've done in a long time .

yeah . yeah , i 'm jealous of mtv faggots who are named after animals .

uh , excuse me , i 'd like to know where he gets his ideas .

you have the largest penis . can we go please ?

no , see , sweetheart , you do n't want to stand up for parasite 'cause i can fuckin ' smell him from here . you know what ? tow words , man : roll on .

ha ! thank you ! see ? he did it . he left .

do n't swear it 's impolite .

i just pulled and it - it came off .

what ? !

ahh ! baby 's got two heads ! ! !

cleo !

you just became a statistic !

it 's off ... i ca n't take the fighting , the back-stabbing , the open hostility . we 're not acting like cheerleaders , we 're acting like a bunch of sorority girls !

-- we practice ! sorry , cleo .

and they get caught !

jus some girlie things for the squad .

... so although their dad said , `` do n't get out of the car until i get back with help , '' they knew the sheriff 's voice as he yelled . `` run to my voice - and do n't look back . '' the twins did as he said , but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient , bouncing their father 's head on the top of the car ! ah ! they jumped , diane ! they jumped !

y'think ?

yeah .

hi , jack .

... do not accept charity . we are two young , able-bodied americans . we do not want a handout . we want a hand-up . give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow . give us corn - the kind you plant , not eat - and we 'll grow our own food and ... and , uh , then cut it , and - uh , y'know eat it ! now , if you 're interested in giving us a home loan , i will sit back down . if not , have a nice day , ma'am .

we were told you could `` fix us up . ''

no ! wait ... um ... we 're the a-squad from lincoln high ? so , uh ...

lucy , do you know for sure you 're going to get that scholarship ?

right . that 'll be fifteen hundred - cash .

or that ! look , you guys , i just want to provide a future for my baby . i know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand . i could open that safe in my sleep !

i know , hannah . look , i 'm not going to get an abortion . i mean , i always planned to get married and have kids - i 'm just going a little out of order . kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself `` with child , '' unmarried , on a long road , with no place to sleep . 'course , that was a long-long time ago . but no matter what , she held her head high and said ... `` pappa do n't preach , i 'm in trouble deep . pappa do n't preach , 'cause i 'm keepin ' my baby . hey . i 'm gon na keep my baby . '' the great one ...

i-i did n't mean to say `` whore , '' diane . i just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head .

oh please , we 've all got bright futures ahead of us - we 're not going to tell anyone . promise !

yeah . this summer at church camp ? i 'm pretty sure i had , y'know , an orgasm .

kansas , i want you to meet someone special .

now how the hell can i help you ?

so could half the women in here . and i 'd rather go out with a nice can ... so watcha here for ? to say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me ...

i 'll take it .

what 's wrong with it ?

just look around . there 's a lot of her spread about . if you do n't remember the face , you must have heard the name of norma desmond .

you bet .

what happened ?

i do n't want it now .

that 's it -- there 's nothing like being twenty-two . now may i suggest that if we 're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ... now back to the typewriter .

oh , that . it 's from a friend of mine . a middle-aged lady , very foolish and very generous .

check .

what about all those ideas you had ?

you know , i 'd take you up on that in a minute . i 'm just not good enough to do it all by myself .

well , for heaven 's sake !

just so you do n't think i 'm a complete swine -- if there 's anything in dark windows you can use , take it . it 's all yours .

so long .

he thinks it could be made into something .

you did ?

with a wildly beating heart .

as for instance ?

is there someplace we can talk ?

so you take plot 27-a , make it glossy , make it slick --

we 've missed you too , dear .

nothing . i just did n't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio . i had no idea how i 'd missed it .

no one leaves a star . that makes one a star .

norma , grow up . you 're a woman of fifty . there 's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five .

you tell her , max . come on , do her that favor . tell her there is n't going to be any picture -- there are n't any fan letters , except the ones you write yourself .

no , you 're not . max ! max !

of course not , joe . it 's just that i do n't want to be left alone . not now , while i 'm under this terrible strain . my nerves are being torn apart . all i ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind .

do n't turn around . keep your eyes on the book .

i know that trick ! he wants to belittle me . he 's trying to get my price down . i 've waited twenty years for this call . now mr. demille can wait till i 'm good and ready .

have one of mine .

so he said it quite a few years ago . so what ? i never looked better in my life . do you know why ? because i 've never been as happy in my life .

look , i was making that up because i thought the whole thing was a mistake . i did n't want to hurt you . you 've been good to me . you 're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me .

has it ever occurred that i may have a life of my own ? that there may be some girl i 'm crazy about ?

i 'm in love with you . do n't you know that ? i 've been in love with you all along .

what 's that ?

it 's a quarter past ten . what time are they supposed to get here ?



why begrudge me a little fun ? i just want you to look nice , my stray little boy .

are you married , mr. -- ?

you know , i 'm pretty expensive . i get five hundred a week .

what month ?

maybe it 's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions ... but you 're not a professional writer .

this is fascinating .

well ?

fair enough .

i hate that word . it is a return . a return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen .

how long is a movie script these days ? i mean , how many pages ?

ssh ! you 'll wake up that monkey .

you are ! writing words , words ! you 've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl but there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles , and technicolor to photograph the red , swollen tongue !

or shall i call my servant ?

it is not . get out .

how much will it be ? i warn you - do n't give me a fancy price just because i 'm rich .

why ? her career ? she got enough out of it . she 's not forgotten . she still gets those fan letters .

naturally . i brought them myself .

i 'm talking to you . my clothes and things are up in the room .

she was the greatest . you would n't know . you are too young . in one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters . men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails . there was a maharajah who came all the way from hyderabad to get one of her stockings . later , he strangled himself with it .

there is the bathroom . i put in soap and a toothbrush .

it will never make house beautiful . i guess it 's o.k . for one night .

thanks . how did you know i was going to stay , this afternoon ?

dressed for what ?

look , maybe i 'd better take my car --

get the readers ' department and see what they have on bases loaded .

it 's about a ball player , a rookie shortstop that 's batting 347. the poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up . but he 's trying to go straight -- except there 's a bunch of gamblers who wo n't let him .

do n't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach ? once a talent like yours gets into that mocambo- romanoff rut , you 're through .

if it was a quarrel , how come you had the gun right there ?

what is the scene ? where am i ?

cameras ? ... what is it , max ?

very good , madam .

you know better than to interrupt me .

but the phantom zone is for criminals .

i 've discovered a new way into the phantom zone .

shut up , and get me a hacksaw .

i think i 'd better keep it .

bianca , try not to be so bloodthirsty when you 're at the wheel . ok ?

we 'll bide our time and keep watch . young girls just ca n't keep a secret . if one of them 's up to something -- we 'll find out .

softball .

do you want to come to argo city ?

she 's right . they 'll string her up .

turn it against her .

she has hostages .

before you go ...

she 'll forget about us eventually .

i know i was acting funny -- -i 'm sorry . it 's just ... i miss it .

what do you feel about me ?

just give me a chance to show how much i love you . love changes everything . love makes everything possib1e .

ethan , tell me more about this woman who 's after you .

i used to work here summers when i was a kid .

where superman 's from ? krypton ?

yes . it reminds me of home .

that woman who 's after me . she hates you . because she knows i love you .

relax . tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream . goodbye .

i have to .

it 's for your own protection .

hey , i thought you were gon na mention us upstairs .

hey ! ethan !

supergirl ?

i 'm wise to your tricks , lady .

you ca n't escape from me that easily . i 'm afraid you do n't know who i am .

i bet they do .

well , there 's several ways to go .

hey , where you going ?

oh , no thanks .

theories ?

nice to meet you .

how do you know ?

jimmy , would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die ?

it was my fault we lost the power source .

can you create life ?

somebody 's got ta do something ! !

no thanks . you go on .

you 're not ... an orphan are you ?

i 'm linda lee .

nonsense .

nothing 's wrong with my skin .

nigel , get lost .

cheer up , nigel . it 's not the end of the world .

thank you . i 'm going to close this up again .

goodbye ...

yes , must n't stop .

going to try . did n't say i could .

there is a way .

no , no . not lovely . 'perfect ' . did everything just right . nobody telling you to change this , move that around . please yourself . that 's the secret of happiness .

just feels , a little , like a tiny bit of argo city ...

criminals .

i know .

earth ? you crossed the dimension barrier ? by yourself ?

what is this place ?

no , no , on the football field . they called me ... ... the smallville flash .

brad is not a good name for a cocktail .

there 's no vodka in it .

tuesday .

good lord , fella ! i 'm talking about your boss .

uh , no , i did n't know that , brad .

i seem to be .

me too . that 's why i put this one up .

ride a thresher ? well , i do n't know . girls are trying just about everything now but --

well , this pate is rather ... unusual .

some people do n't think it 's healthy .

you should n't say that , you 're the chairman -- ... uh , chairperson ...

i 'm sorry , mr. white , but i 've got an errand to run .

oh . you 're going away .

i would n't know mr. kent . most of the people i went to high school with are still in high school .

what about this week 's check ?

dishwasher ? any luck ?

name ?

say what ?

that 's so you 're still getting some money when you hit 65 .

first rip-off , man ! supposed to be 225 bucks a week ! you know what this sucker says ? ? $ 143.80 ! federal tax ! state tax ! social security tax !

you designed it ?

what do you want ?

uh ... what channel were you watching ?

columbia .

decaffeinated too ?

man , what is this ?

uh ...

suit yourself , gus . say , does your boss use a computer in this operation ?

i ai n't about to argue with you . what 's gon na happen to them three ? ross the boss and those ladies ?

do n't make me talk , please . i got enough problems just hangin ' on .

it was hot !

all right , kent . i just hope you know what you 're doing . if you really think smallville is your big chance , go for it .

there 's no rush .

he was asleep before his head hit the pillow . well , this was only the biggest day of his life . i really do n't know how to thank you .

i 'd wash that out with some iodine ... okay , mercurochrome .

okay , kent , call your people and tell them the prodigal son is coming home . favoring clark -- happy now , he turns to leave the office . shot loses perry but we continue to hear his voice , o.s .

whoopee .

the picture 's fine . that 's the way she looks in real life .

superman . the boy you left behind .

how would you know ?

diet soda ?

he 's bound to slip up sooner or later .

now , vera ... uh , simpson , you know my staff dietician ?

wait for gus to get here , sis .

she 's not his mama either .

somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the aerospace center and reach vulcan .

computers talk to other computers , right ?

see what happens when i do n't have my orange juice ? the human body is only a workable , fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you 'd show to -- -- . . . gee . . .

i have to go back . . .to the fortress . . .

i 'm in love with you . how do you feel ?

frankly , once you 've seen superman in action , niagara falls tends to leave you cold .

lois , you 're amazing .

oh sure , everything is complimentary . until you get the bill .

do i detect a note of jealousy ?

what ? ?

there is some good in you , lex , after all .

it has everything .

this way lex .

artemis ? do you read me ?

i did n't ask her anything . . .

the three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation . now as you know , we had no death penalty -

for many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony . then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on earth are classified as `` criminals . ''

north .

really lois , we 've got to stop meeting this --

put down lex luthor !

there is something more you want . the greed is written on your face .

why do you say this to me when you know i will kill you for it ?

yes ?

lacy . . . i . . .

maybe if you 'd have met who i am now , instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago , it would have been different between us .

you know : strong , gentle , tall men with bright blue eyes and square . men who like to dance slow , the old fashioned way , the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom .

come early . the view is so romantic from my balcony .

well , my career takes up a lot of my time .

do n't tell me . you learned to dance at church socials .

oh , clark , you 're so delightfully primitive .

superman ? has something happened to him ?

clark , it 's lois . this is the fourth message . i 've left . . . where are you ?

the president is about to speak . i do n't think it 's going to be good news .

clark . . . wait !

and what am i ? a shriner ? no , if you 'll join forces with me , together we can make the world safe for war profits again .

absolutely !

i 'd just like to have a little less sensationalism .

stuff it .

darling , it 's good riddance . let her go . and while you 're at it , fire that clark kent . he has n't been here in days . he has n't even called .

our other dinner guest .

what 's that ?

who ?

this was n't in the plan .

quiet ! you 'll make him self-conscious .

that hair contains a sample of superman 's genetic material . the building blocks of his body . with my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes , i will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me !

i had n't counted on this but . . . . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat . i am a ...

precisely . and then it came to me . my greatest ever plan . i made a deal with some minor league bad boys . arms dealers , renegades generals , you know the type . with you gone , we 'll make a fortune rearming the world .

i will .

no , mom . you know i would n't break my promise .

you 're not the only one .

they will once i hang it on him in tomorrow 's edition .

clark kent , if you had only seen it the way i did , you -

oh sure . a man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it was n't a trick .

for what ? oh , i 've see the way the other half lives . my sister , for instance . it looks terrific , but is that what i really want ? three kids , two cats , and fifteen needlepoint pillows ? i 'd go bananas after one week . hell , i need this crazy existence of mine . like i need the plague , right ? that 's what your thinking .

i just took a shot at it .

you described the exact contents of my purse .

'swell . ' when was the last time i heard anybody say - where are you from , anyway ?

no .

sure , and let the plane crash in the middle of the city .

could n't we forget the plane ? you could lift me in your big strong arms ?

of course i can . i love you .

what are you going to do to him ?

oh . why ? does he live up here ?

yours not to reason why , miss teschmacher . relax ! enjoy it ! just look at that smog !

no news is not good news . y'know

weak sister . i still ca n't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out . y'know ?

no , you 're going to get kissed ,

tune me in , lady . an explosion such as the one superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the krypton rock .

meteorites !

exactly , miss teschmacher .

damn ! this will get him .

i did n't say a word .

i needed this , y'know ? i really needed this . just when i 'm nearing the fruition of my project , big bird flies into town . go ahead ! kill me by inches ! put me on the agony rack !

again ? ? ?

what about dinner ? i have to worry about the crime of the century , that 's all . y'know ? am i supposed to worry about what 's in the refrigerator , too ? what 's in it ?

me and my real estate ? how many other girls , miss teschmacher , are lucky enough to have a park avenue address like this ?

you and your real estate .

on the salary he pays me , i ca n't make my rent without it .

what 're you writing , lois ?

do n't brag now , jonathan .

i was thinkin ' what to call him . i was thinkin ' i had an uncle who was a fine man , you recall him ? the church sexton

well , physiologically , he ... wo n't quite fit .

yes , true . but on other worlds there would be other problems - heat , cold , no life , no life support systems ... no , lara , believe me ; earth is the least of evils . on earth , his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that ca n't be helped . but with his denser molecular structure , he will also be strong . he will be fast , he will be virtually invulnerable .

enjoyed it ?

lois , the kickback story ...

here 's the story on that east 19th street murder spree . page one with a banner headline seems about right to me .

do you like pink ?

what color underwear am i wearing ?

well , i mean it 's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it .

i 'd appreciate it if you did n't smoke .

the answer is yes . now what 's the question ?

i still do n't get it .

you mean bullets and fire and all that ca n't hurt him , but this kind of rock --

for the first time today , superman i must tell you that you 're wrong . but how could you know that - oh , well . i guess i could tell you now . y'see , actually ... but this conversation is becoming rather dry , is n't it .

it would never have worked , luthor . you are a dreamer -- a sick , twisted dreamer .

oh , that . listen -- you 're busy -- and it 's a long story --

what happened ?

i did n't know . i was in a panic . i guessed she 'd been bitten by an insect , but there was no doctor . the nearest hospital was forty miles away , and zoe was continuing to swell . klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her , while i dialed the hospital . i finally got a doctor on the line . he sounded young , but cool . he was confident , but there was a nervousness . he have been an intern . this was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this . he wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing , but he was just as scared as i was .

i woke to the sound of zoe 's breathing . it was laboured . i looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen . i grabbed her , rushed to the kitchen , and splashed water on her face .

what ... does it turn to ?

but you said ...

which one ?

ally . that was my nickname .

i know risa and wendell walker . they would n't hire a goddamned lawyer . and the ottos would n't deal

case ?

i understand .

nicole , i 'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity . do n't feel bad . unless you feel strange about wearing it .

they just finished supper .

billy , please . the children .

why would he do that ? you did n't have anything to do with the accident .

i 'll help pay for nicole , if that 's what you 're really talking about . i 'll even give you the money i got for my kids . that 's what we used to do , remember ? help each other . this was a community .

we 've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards . we 've got people pointing fingers , making side deals , and dickering over percentages . yesterday , i heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad . the rescue squad . because they did n't act fast enough .

i do n't see how that concerns you , billy .

well , sam , i might as well tell you the truth . it 's this lawsuit you 've gotten yourself all involved with . i want you to drop the damned thing .

it 's natural .

no . it should be dry by now .

ca n't you make it later ?

yes . he does .

the walkers loved sean . he was their only child ... the object of all their attention . i mean , wendell 's a withdrawn sort of man . that 's his nature . but risa , she 's still got dreams .

did they give him special care ?

were his parents ... attentive to him ?

you talked about it ?

and they loved bear .

dolores . no one calls me 'mrs . driscoll ' .

the ottos always waited for the bus with bear . they were the only parents who did that , together like that . i guess they 're what you might call hippies .

away from your crazy mom .

i 'll just strap it on the roof .

what do you think ?

a cup of tea would be nice . would it be alright if i sit down for a few minutes , mrs. otto ? i want to talk to you .

you want a cup of tea or something ?

how was it ?

and winter ?

summer 's over . it 's fall .

would you like a cup of tea , billy ? there 's a piece of cake left .

rats ! they fought the dogs and killed the cats , and bit the babies in the cradles , and ate the cheeses out of vats . and licked the soup from the cook 's own ladles , split open the kegs of salted sprats , made nests inside men 's sunday hats , and even spoiled the women 's chats , by drowning their speaking with shrieking and squeaking in fifty different sharps and flats ...

what 's a ditty again ?

so you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this . it 's not going to be easy , nicole . do you understand that ?

what do you want me to do for you , mr. stephens ?

thank you , nicole .

and what was the weather like at this time ?

wanda and hartley . they lost bear . he was their adopted son . a beautiful boy . indian .

almost three .

tell me about it .

you always think you 're prepared for these things .

yes . i can hear you breathing too .

the problem is i have no idea who i 'm talking to right now .

remember that time we were having the car washed and i started playing with the automatic window ? how old was i , daddy ? five or six ? i got absolutely soaked , remember ?

i 'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate .

mrs. otto , there is no such thing as an accident . the word does n't mean anything to me . as far as i 'm concerned , somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner . some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement . they decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference . that 's what 's done , mrs. otto . i 've seen it happen so many times before .

i 'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this , mrs. otto , but the walkers said you would understand . i know it 's an awful time , but it 's important that we talk .

been drinking since high school . fucked himself up . used to be smart enough .

i was scared .

there was a brown dog that ran across the road up there , right by the dump , and dolores slowed down not to hit him , and he ran into the woods . and then dolores drove on and turned onto the marlowe road , as usual . i remember that . i 'm remembering it pretty clearly .

about eight-thirty in the morning .

what time in the morning was this ?

will the police do anything to her ?

how about sunday night ? that 's always the best time .

what do you mean ?

great .

nothing .

very slick .

thanks , i see him ...

how are you tonight , mr. falco ?

i guess you 're right , but -

i thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated .

thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow .

i see bartha gave you cold tongue for supper . hey , wait a minute !

i 'm afraid i ca n't cope with them .

why , has he bothered you before ?

no . i 'm going home .

you in a mood , susie , to run over to milgrim 's later and buy a few new frocks ?

no ...

i 'm taking up the situation with you now ...

you know , dear , we 're drifting apart , you and i , and i do n't like that .

alan was not ... unbalanced when i married him . and he was not ... 'indifferent to women ' no matter what they said ! hunsecker i 'm not fighting with you , puss ...

i would n't have called the boy exactly balanced ...

what a question , dear , with that newspaper in your hand ...

yes , the justice , that 's right . but i think you had it in the column .

say , that 's good - it 's nice - in fact , it 's apt , harry !

say hello to sidney falco . tickle him - he 's been a bad boy tonight . he called you my fat friend .

she mighta jumped . love suicide ? check it for me , phil ... it 's a real heart throb .

i was trying to build her up , not tear her down -

why give her real proof ? you nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right , j.j. , - but she almost followed him out the window . what do you want - a chronic invalid ?

j.j. , i want you to get them back their job , steve and the quintet .

i do n't ?

you told me you 'd break up that romance - when ?

is that a fact ? he 's a dilly , ai n't he ? by the by , what did he have against this boy ?

i beg your pardon ! i turn myself inside out to help you and now i 'm a heavy . here 's your shoe , there 's your coat , that 's the door !

but , sidney darling , the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning !

we 're old friends , chickie - quit it ! a big columnist comes in this room , without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter ! what did you think would happen in his house ?

you were thrilled to be interviewed . were you `` interviewed '' ?

i do n't think so .

do n't you ever get messages , eyelashes ? i called you twice .

that 's no way to talk ...

sidney , i know you by now . do n't do a dance with me ...

begging your pardon , i have n't been down the bowery in years !

i could almost forgive you if what you did to steve came from jealousy and love ...

listen , get a good night 's sleep - tomorrow 's another day . feeling sorry for yourself wo n't help .

yes , but why ?

i was n't looking for a brawl . i came to bring him a present . wan na bite to eat ?

joan , call a cop ! we 'll arrest this kid for larceny !

what do you do for that hundred a week . fall out of bed ?

steve , i feel exhausted ... what do you want me to do ?

and on tuesday - hasenpfeffer . steve how do you think i realized i love you ?

i 'm sorry , honey , it 's just that i 'm thiiis close .

you need a break . you 'll see it clear when you come back .

shut up ! shut up ! ! motherfucker ! it 's all your fault ! it 's your fault ! !

it must end here ... or i am the future .

i 'm sorry , john .

yeah . i guess so . my mom says when i 'm , like , 45 , i think , i send him back through time to 1984. but right now he has n't even been born yet . man , is messes with your head . where 's that other bolt ? thanks . mom and him were only together for one night , but she still loves him , i guess . i see her crying sometimes . she denies it totally , of course . like she says she got something in her eye .

you do n't feel any emotion about it one way or the other ?

no .

no , no , no . you got ta listen to the way people talk . see , you do n't say like `` affirmative '' or some shit like that . you say ... no problemo .

affirmative .

listen to me , very carefully , okay ? you 're not a terminator any more . alright ? you got that ? you ca n't just go around killing people !

terminated ! ? shit ! why did n't you tell me ? we got ta right now !

it ca n't form complex machines . guns and explosives have chemicals , moving parts . it does n't work that way . but it can form solid metal shapes .

where we going ?

liquid metal .

no way !

no shit ?

i could n't ... oh , god . you ... came here ... to stop me ?

yeah . drag , huh ?

so what do you think , doctor ? i 've shown a lot of improvement , have n't i ?

and what it that ?

is it safe for them here ?

uh huh , great . then those fat fucks in washington figure , what the hell , let a computer run the whole show , right ?

why him ?

i 'll bet . makes you a more efficient killer , right ?

unknown .

you think you 're alive and safe , but you 're already dead . everybody , you , him ... everybody ... you 're all fucking dead !

our duty is to help furtwngler with his defence , that 's why i want you to look at this ... these are part of the transcripts of the trial at nuremberg . we ca n't get them translated fast enough . but i guess you understand german , right ?

major arnold believes he has a moral duty , too .

do n't see me to my door , there 's no need .

respect your elders and your betters !

my manner ? why do n't you go downstairs , get a cup of coffee and calm down ? what 's the matter , emmi ? what 's going on with you ? what 's wrong ?

your manner .

that 's big of him .

i guess you admire musicians .

for chrissakes i hate that shit , cut it out .

i 'm gon na get that fucking bandleader , colonel . no deal . no fucking deal .

what museum ?

there are good party members who help , and there are dirty non-party members who inform on you . of course , they gave him privileges .

emmi , stop ! i want to show you something . let me show you something and then if you want to leave , you can leave , please please . his friends , they did this . and he gave them birthday concerts .

come in , emmi , this is your office , too . emmi , this is lieutenant david wills .

i 'm sorry .

your mother , too .

says here because of your father . what 's that mean ?

i said i have illegitimate children . i do n't know how many .

now , that young conductor what 's his name ? that miracle kid , you know who i mean . von karajan ! but you called him something else . c'mon . what did you call von karajan ?

'happy birthday , dear adolf , love wilhelm . ' or words to that effect . that sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying , 'okay , adolf , you win . you 're the number one man . have a swell party . '

what telegram ?

what did goering say ?

i was warned .

you sure knew a lot of people in high places .

i do n't remember in detail , there were so many .

i did not conduct at at the rally , i conducted on the evening before the rally .

no . but that 's why we hated him . we admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he did n't have to join the party and yet he had a better life than any of us . he did n't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad . he got everything from them , everything . he was filthier than any of us party members .

how could i forget ?

do you know what 's in this archive ?

you seem to understand the question , now how about answering it ?

right . claims assessor .

it was hermann goering . i was told he just made the maestro his privy councillor , no questions asked . although dr. furtwngler stood up to him . and to dr. goebbels .

absolutely not .

it 's not brain surgery , chuck .

come to the office , please .

we will , kiddo .

great .

sarah .

ticklish ?

it 's better that way .

pain can be controlled . you disconnect it .

if i do , you have to get away , disappear without a trace . different country , different name , everything . in case they send another one .

that 's good . now , seven more like that while i make fuses .

you must have had a fun child-

well , we 're gon na uninvent the bastard . eighty-six it . we 'll blow up the place ... burn it down . something .

what about it ?

you 'll learn .

come on , me ? the mother of the future ? am i tough ? organized ? i ca n't even balance my checkbook . i cry when i see a cat that 's been run over ... and i do n't even like cats .

i volunteered .

it 's okay . forget it .

caught one ? you mean you got shot ?

kyle , what 's it like when you go through time ?

pay attention . the 600 series had rubber skin . we spotted them easy . but these are new . they look human . sweat , bad breath , everything . very hard to spot . i had to wait 'til he moved on you before i could zero him .

okay . okay . but this ... cyborg ... if it 's metal ...

why do n't you just stretch out here and get some sleep . it 'll take your mom a good hour to get here from redlands .

go ! go ! he 's got her .

to make a statement . i 'm gon na give them the name . maybe the jackals can help us out for once .

no . keep getting an answer- ing machine .

because it 's fair . give me next quarter . if you still feel this way , vote your shares ...

always .

no .

like what ... my favorite color ... ?

i have to get to the airport ...

please , nicholas , let me show you ...

fuck you .

nicholas , this is fake . it 's all part of the game ...

what are you doing ?

that gun . that ... that 's not automatic . the guard had an automatic ...

get us out of here ...

it 's out of your hands .

how many times have you done this ? i 'm interested .

yeah ? i was your waitress on your birthday . connie told you about c.r.s . that day , remember ? i was already playing my part , < u > before < /u > you started the game .

yeah . first communion . are n't i a little angel ?

want anything to drink ?

let me go get some clothes on . we 'll talk , okay ? be right back .

well ... the red bra .

it 's okay , dad .

goodnight .

i know the owner of campton place . i could talk to him in the morning .

investment banking . moving money from place to place .

where are we going ?

... two hundred dollars a toe .

you 're a grown man . i 'm not responsible for you .

you deserted me .

read what it says : `` warning , do < u > not < /u > attempt to open . if elevator stops , use emergency ... ``

this is nuts .

he 's turning blue !

how do you know ?

calm down . why would they keep playing after you paid ?

what have they been doing to you ?

it does n't stop , nick . i paid the bill , i gave 'em their money , but it all started again . they wo n't leave me alone ...

who ?

i redecorated . what about you ?

conrad , what a surprise . gesundheit .

like , this way ... sort of ...

what whistle ? there 's no fucking whistle . this is fucking dangerous .

they know you ... you worked for them . you can get me in .

it 's never happened . we 've never had an unsatisfied customer .

how long will these take ?

no , thank you .

ah , mr. van orton . here you go ...

sometimes i wonder how much of him there is in me .

i 'm not sure .

mr. van orton ... ?

is everything alright ?

thank you . goodnight .

there was an incident a few days ago ... a nervous breakdown , they said . the police took him . they left this address , in case anyone ...

pleasure to meet you , i 'd like to see my brother , thank you .

your ex-wife .

why are you following me ?

what ?

modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations . you brought us here to scare us . insomnia , that was just a decoy issue . you 're disgusting .

hi , luke sanderson , bad sleeper , i 'm your basic tosser-turner , and you are ...

you get your money .

there 's a carriage house around back .

go ahead .

we ca n't stay here looking for her . she does n't want to be found ...

where in the hell can she be .

that depends on your definition of ghosts . i 'm going to check on her , and then i 'm going to stay awake .

no .

this is the last chapter . please , please give me clearance . it 's for science .

but if the group knows it 's being studied as a group , you contaminate the results . the deception is minor .

not the way you 've constructed your group , it 's just not ethical !

then who called me ?

like she smelled it too ?

i was n't thinking about my mother 's bathroom .

so ... smell ... is ... smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories . and a memory can trigger a smell .

nell ! what 's wrong ?

what happened ?

yes , this is doctor marrow .

maybe they 're mary 's .

yes .

why do you need a chain like that ?

are you mister dudley , the caretaker ?

it 's a job . i keep banker 's hours . i set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six . you can serve yourselves . breakfast is ready at nine . i do n't wait on people . i do n't stay after dinner . not after it begins to get dark . i leave before dark comes . we live in town . nine miles . so there wo n't be anyone around if you need help . we could n't even hear you , in the night .

mrs. dudley .

it 's make the soup or answer the door . ca n't do both .

this is real , i 'm not making it up ! theo , you saw it ! you were there -- the banging and last night . you , you all saw the painting !

carolyn showed me where she hid him , hid him with all the ones he killed --

there 's hundreds of them . this must be a record of the children who died at the mills , like luke said .

that 's so sad .

yes . i 've missed it .

the taj mahal was n't a palace , it was a tomb . why did n't he tell us ?

a monster ? but he built this for the woman he loved , like the taj mahal .

what did it cost ?

why not ?

that 's what gordon 's always saying .

why ?

it 's not a compliment .

no . you 're not specific enough to be a person . you 're more like a vibe .

gordon ? he 's been with me for years . he 's not as tough as he looks .

is there anything in the world that you want or need ?

adhara . i told your father , if you 're looking for a name , you ca n't go wrong with a constellation .

you think i 'm staying ?

i do n't know everyone here . he was so traumatized he split . maybe he was gordon 's < u > pusher < /u > .

what .

close quarters combat . keep one in my own home .

cq what ?

that 's a high-end item . total reliability .

see what i mean ? wearing bloomin ' uniforms n ' all .

how 'd the two of you hook up , then ?

he came in with jenny to the restaurant where i work . that 's not where they met .

now what . you gon na take your new arsenal , go visit terry valentine , just like that ? boom bam boom .

no , not my girl . self-control , she had . point of pride . and people do n't change , do they .

valentine . what 's he got to say for himself ?

you 're home , then .

i could use a vacation . of course , i keep forgetting , for you this < u > is < /u > a vacation .

do us a favor . ca n't even go have a slash without 'em saying , what 're you going in there for ?

minor officials bother you , do n't they ?

good luck to him . he could n't find his prick if he did n't wear y-fronts .

you sound like my fucking probation officer .

-- they want southern , i do southern , they want midwest , i do midwest , they want tall , blonde , and twenty-two , i 'm shit out of luck . one thing i ca n't do is english . americans ca n't . should n't even try . and laurence olivier could n't do us .

just now ? overnight ?

i can see the attraction .

early 70 's . i was away . maidstone . possibly brixton .

this town 's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as `` the early 70 's . '' christ , my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me .

on what . what makes you so certain .

why not .

what line is he in .

when i 'm not honing my craft in episodic television i do double-duty as a voice coach . not that her accent would have hobbled her progress . not with that look .

she never told anyone else . about the convict strain -- or is it stain ? no , i was privileged . i was someone who helped jenny efface her past .

not ashamed .

i ca n't believe jenny told you all that . about me . she was always so embarrassed .

here , are you always this sarky ?

wanted to talk to you , did n't i ?

your client have a deal in long beach ? how about downtown ? there 's some folks there -- oh , wait , they 're all dead . any of this ring a bell ?

a < u > statement < /u > ? i would n't mind getting a statement . you see , < u > my < /u > client -- the united states government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client .

i could swear i met you with ian at the emi offices in london .

well , time off for good behavior , you know . i should n't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place . i got lumbered with the job they were responsible for . i do n't mind pulling me own cart , but not someone else 's , know what i mean .

two blacks and a mexican in a car . who 's driving ?

kinda makes you wonder why more people do n't put a bullet through their fuckin ' skulls , does n't it .

you know her ?

so why would he want to see you .

looking for a bloke named valentine . know him ?

walked .

you know i do n't live with him .

you 've made it ... brighter .

exercising my visitation rights .

... i stank , did n't i ?

you 've got talent , anyone could see that . and he 's the best . if he thinks a student has talent , he 'll take 'em on for next to nothing . you 're a cinch to be accepted , i could cover the cost of the lessons , like i said , it 's pretty modest --

hello , rachel .

well , look , i do n't claim to be an expert --

mistake , no , it says e-flat , she plays e-flat . ping-ping . hit the right note , always . very proper .

ah .

well , i do n't pretend to be an expert .

sure .

cash ? !

yeah .

you 're out of line , mister .

... was that a pass ?

... it just goes to show , when one door slams shut , another one opens . here 's to ya , uh ...

do ? hell , nothing . well , you 'll want to keep tabs on your investment , of course , but i 'm looking for a silent partner . i 've done the research , i 've contacted the vendors , the deal is set . i 'm just looking for venture capital , friend . disappear if you want , check in whenever you like -- i want the dough ; i do n't take attendance .

... i did n't recognize you without the smock . did i -- damn -- did i leave something at the shop ?

come on in .

please , ed .

mm .

i only work here ! and the lady 's husband would know ... oh , jesus .

awkward ? ! ann 'd throw me out on my keister ! hell , it 's her family 's store -- *her* store . i serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership , ed .

no , dave , i was n't .

i , uh ... thanks .

me ? us ! the party at nirdlinger 's -- i told you last week , for the christmas push .

... my first instinct was , no , no , the whole idea was nuts . but maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop , nose against the exit , afraid to try turning the knob . what if i could get the money ?

i tried to tell him the whole story , but riedenschneider stopped me . he said the story made his head hurt , and anyway he did n't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of big dave ...

it was big dave 's .

i knew about it . big dave told me about it , and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money .

good ! any questions give me a ring -- turandot suite ; if i 'm out leave a message . you sure you do n't want anything ? no ?

sure , walter . thanks .

yeah , the best .

i 'm fine . thanks .

'scuse me , just finished dinner . um . frankly , doris 'd be better off with the county defender .

... did you make that up ?

damn , i got a headache to beat the band .

yeah -- lucky for us , huh , pal ?

whuddya mean ?

uh-huh .

... we goin ' ?

mr ... ?

not an owner .

second chair .

he 's a barber .

great .

no .

the claws are sharp ... i must have cut myself . better move these crates to the secure storage area where they 'll be safe .

looks like the curse is still at work .

does n't look like it . we 're damned lucky . this statue is priceless .

he 'll be back . relax . we 're in good shape . your security is air tight . there 've been no more incidents , nothing suspicious . there 's no reason to call off the opening now .

it 's too late now . guests are arriving . the mayor 's car is pulling up .

i do n't want to scare people .

do they have to wear uniforms ?

what 's the combination ?

that would leave one exit for hundreds of people . you 'd be violating every fire regulation on the books . we 'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells . one more question . i see a big hole . if this entire thing is run by computer , what happens if the power fails ?

the sub-basement , huh ? great idea .

nice to see you , lieutenant .

this is n't an animal , vince . i 've been on this case four months , remember ? i 've learned a few things .

i believed them .

how do you explain the part about beauregard ?

i 've got to admit , that was a damn sight better than `` the dog ate my homework '' .

you 're kidding .

where 's the head ?

may i see that ?

it 's like ringing the dinner bell .

`` nocturnal . external hair and bony plates . locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers . reduced optic chiasm '' ... poor eyesight . `` external mucoid nasal glands , '' ... very keen scent ... `` morphological characteristics : highly robust . aggressiveness : extreme . ''

what are they ?

we ca n't do without you . you 're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology . you 're practically an institution around here .

i do n't believe it .

yes . john made quite a study of the whole museum . he had a copy of my original plans .

they fill seven floors . we have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world . just to give you an idea , there are more than three million insects specimens . not to mention amphibians , reptiles , birds , anthropological artifacts , meteorites , minerals and gems . only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display .

evolutionary biologist . i study how life on earth evolved over millions of years .

i 'm an evolutionary biologist . what do you do ?

she 's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs . that lady said they were on the fourth floor .

there 's another possibility . a lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage .

for what ?

hide quickly !

is there another way around ?

vince !

i did n't imagine it . i know what i saw . are you sure there are enough men in there ?

dr. green ...

i do n't know .

would you mind showing it to me ?

the people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten . just like beauregard . one part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision . the hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact .

if he were alive he 'd have contacted me .

i thought you were in a hurry .

you are a travel agent , are n't you ? `` doris '' ? your job is to help people travel .

today .

i 'm sorry to keep you . how can i help ?

we 're not watching the sea .

why do you feel that truman 's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world ?

people forget it takes the < i > population < /i > of an entire country to keep the show running .

and the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country .

istanbul , turkey , you 're on with master videographer , christof .

of course , there has n't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member --

guess i always thought they 'd adopt .

it 's beautiful ! what are you waiting for ?

no .

no ? really ? good , i mean , i thought possibly a pizza . how about friday ?

i 'm truman , truman burbank --

i do n't know what to think , marlon . maybe i 'm going out of my mind , but i get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow .

when you were hauling chickens for kaiser poultry , what was the furthest you ever went off the island ?

what 're we doing here , truman ?

could be . beard looks phony . it 's when i 'm unpredictable . they ca n't stand that . that 's why we 've got to get out of here . can you come with me ?

trust me .

nursery ?

yeah ? outta what ?

-- what are my plans now ? well , next i 'm thinking of tackling the yuba river in an authentic canoe from the algonquin tribe . -- i 'm talking about the north fork , a class five rapid - only i 'm not going < i > down < /i > the yuba , i 'm going < i > up. < /i > do you honestly think for one minute i 'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents ... do you ?

stop this now . i 'll do it . i swear .

why do n't i make you some of this new mococoa drink ? all natural . cocoa beans from the upper slopes of mount nicaragua . no artificial sweeteners --

how do you know ?

i think i 'm going to stay up for a while .

gee , that 's great .

hi , honey . look at this . it 's a `` chef's-mate . '' dicer , slicer and peeler in one . never needs sharpening . dishwasher safe .

i 've got something to tell you . you 'd better sit down .

fine . i 'll tell her .

-- and your teacher said , `` you 're too late , truman . there 's nothing left to explore . ''

-- how do you know about that ?

do you live around here ?

yup .

scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --

are you going to let us in on what exactly you 're trying to prove --

yes .

looking for him for what ?

is this dr. kurtzweil 's residence ?

i told you -- he and i were old friends --

i 've been using you ? !

you told me you had answers .

you found something ?

i 'll know soon enough .

i was right about dallas . was n't i , agent mulder ?

heard you come here now and again . figured you 'd be needing a little drinky tonight .

my name 's kurtzweil . dr. alvin kurtzweil .

no . i 've been watching your career for a good while . back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that .

hang on . i 'm going to get you out of here .

scully --

why was i assigned to you ? to debunk your work . to reign you in . to shut you down .

i can , mulder . i debated whether or not to even tell you in person , because i knew --

i already gave skinner my letter of resignation .

what are you doing ?

i have no idea .

mulder --

they haul gas in tanker trucks , they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they do n't haul viruses in tanker trucks .

all the equipment is brand new .

i do n't know . but i have a hunch what you 're going to find here is n't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced .

you knew this man did n't die at the bomb site before we got here .

it 's like jelly .

is that what you 'd like me to do ?

i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting .

are you drunk , mulder ?

they were the ones that put us together .

i think you must have an idea . they cited a history of problems relating back to 1993 .

hang on . i 'm gon na get you out of there .

scully , get somebody to open this door .

where are you , mulder ?

i just did . you 're buying .

i know you 're bored in this assignment , but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now .

jesus , mulder ...

no . i have n't .

i 'm on the roof .

where are you , scully ?

sit down , they 're still talking to agent scully .

you have precious little time . what i 've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists . you hold in your hand the power to end the project .

a weak vaccine against the virus agent scully has been infected with . it must be administered with ninety six hours .

he 's come and gone .

she said convincingly .

`` mocky-lock is the bogeyman , mocky-lock wants me where i am . ''

i got it .

carl , do you know ? like on a map ...

where the hell are we ?

he brought you to me , did n't he ? if you want julia to live , trust me . trust him .

there 's always a chance they 'll confess .

what if he was n't like this ? what if he was `` normal ? '' conscious . how far would you go ?

yep . and guess who they hired to seal up the place ?

she 's bringing stargher into hers .

i think that 's the whole point .

pump in two liters of pure oxygen , please henry .

what about the cat ?

is she alright ?

no .

any psychiatric medication ?

when we got here , you just topped and pulled her out .

i 'll get her ...

so ?

you sure you want to go through with this ?

no . can you get a man close ?

warscheinlich ist der murder .

sayen sie ed our den leuten damit sie es auch wissen .

why are you lying ?

i 'm sorry .

how did you know i would be here ?

let 's go away .

yes .

that 's harry 's place , is n't it ?

we 're both in it , harry .

... and buried him .

... to steal my girl .

tell me about him .

the porter is going to talk to us tonight .

why do n't you leave this town - go home ?

no .

i was talking to another friend of harry 's . a baron kurtz - do you know him ?

thank you .

win what ?

calloway !

i tell you i heard him running ahead of me .

yes . where were you when you saw him first ?

you 're not locking her up ?

and there was a third man there . i suppose that does n't sound peculiar to you .

getting around , martins .

... a cop . you 're a real cop i suppose .

best thing that ever happened ...

must have known i was broke . even sent me an airplane ticket . it 's a shame .

holly martins .

you a friend of lime 's ?

martins .

i 'm so glad to have met you , sir . i 've read quite a few of your books .

well , look , is there a car here i can use ?

zane grey .

oh , i thought you would know , you 're a writer . of course you do . good night , old man .

oh , mr. martins , good evening .

goodness , that 's awkward .

come upstairs a moment .

they would n't know me .

yes , cultural re-education section propaganda . very important in a place like this . we do a little show each week . last week we did `` hamlet '' and the week before we had something ...

never heard of him .

what is it , sergeant ?

you told them , did n't you ?

... exactly who did you tell about me ? hmm ?

... your address ?

we came out of his place like this , and were walking this way . a friend of his called to him from over there . harry went across and from up there came the truck . it was just about here .

vinkel .

fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei .

suppose i take ...

no , no . he came late after they carried him to the joseph statue .

ah , er war gleich tot - i mean , sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu . ein moment ... wart ein bissel ... wartein bissel . fraulein schmidt !

er , alive ? he could n't have been alive , not with his head in the way it was .

what 's he saying ?

sehen sie da gleich da unter . da unten ist est passiert . passiert - english .

yes , sir .

baron kurtz .

should i make it all fact ?

of course there was . some ice for mr. martins .

funny ?

yea , ok. i will be , i will be , i promise .

i 'll share something with you .

what happened ?

a bit fucking late .

i do n't know , just a fin . over there . about a hundred meters .

everyone ok ?

so ?

yes , of course i can swim . how far do you think it is ?

we moved rooms because of him .

two .

one kilometer

if it 's too far , then we 'll drown . but if we dont try then we 'll never know .

not too bad .

i do ; i follow it . but okay , say god provided the ram . so what ? once abraham raised the knife , in his heart it was as if he 'd killed him . he could never forget that . and neither could isaac . look at him : he 's traumatized , he 's a putz for the rest of his life . by the end he ca n't tell jacob from esau ... .

no one follows that midrash .

are you shitting me ? ? right in the store ?

let 's look at the fucking thing .

yeah . he 's a respected scholar . even no-am chomsky says he --

yes .

you coming ?

who am i ? ? who are you , you schmucks , you ca n't even make a decent swastika ... . give me the paint . give it to me .

people still need values , beliefs ... .

is it like eichmann ? are we goofing ?

you want a punch in the mouth ?

what ... ? you think i 'm jewish ?

judaism does n't even need god . you have the torah , the law . that 's your fucking god ... . the book 's closed .

no , i think you should n't .

no . nothing follows . you do n't do it because it 's smart or stupid or it saves your soul . you 're not saved . nobody 's saved . you do it because the torah tells you do . you submit to the torah .

they do n't put them in the torah . i 'll get you a chumash , they 'll have them there ... bet ... gimel ... dalid ... hay ... how come you 're here instead of with curtis ? besides the hebrew lessons ...

it 's silent . it holds a place , takes a vowel . the vowels are little dots that go under the letters .

who gets contaminated , the jews or the gentiles ?

your father ? ?

i 'm talking to you right now . who 's linda ?

`` and the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms ... ''

i work at the big boy warehouse . in queens . i drive a fork-lift .

at first , no one will know why the victims are being killed .

... i thought we agreed , no anti- semitism ... it 's exactly what we 're trying to put behind us ... . trash the blacks , fine ; but ...

no , but deep down , beneath the `` tolerance '' they learn on television , nothing 's changed . the very word makes their skin crawl . it is n't even hate , really . it 's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor . we want to step on it . crush it . we do n't even know why . it 's a physical reaction . everyone feels it .

more cultural than political .

you work for the < i > new york times < /i > . your whole job in life is not to understand things like me .

deracinate ... tear out the roots . a people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land : the sun , the sea , the soil . this is how they know themselves . but the jew does n't have soil .

danny , what makes you think you know all this ?

real men -- white , christian men -- we fuck a woman . we make her come with our cocks . but the jew does n't like to penetrate and thrust -- he ca n't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions . oral sex is technically a perversion , you know that , do n't you ? after a woman has been with a jewish man , she never wants a normal partner again . a normal man .

everybody likes to , do n't they ?

a poison ... ?

german . mine , too . so who do you think 's given more to the world , the germans -- beethoven , goethe , nietzsche -- or the entire continent of africa ? ibos , bantus , mandingos ...

so are you ... but they 'll believe you ... . lina moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea . that you proposed it in a meeting at her house . ah , jesus , danny ... what were you thinking ? are you glad manzetti 's dead ? do you really want to kill jews ? you want to kill me ?

you 're lying .

that does n't mean i do n't like hearing it .

you mean ilio manzetti ?

are you with the fbi , mr . balint ? ... or any other law enforcement agency ?

i 'm not here to talk about religious law , if you do n't like --

is n't it true ?

so that 's what ? nineteen thirty minutes ... what time is it now ...

you said they did n't have night guards .

christ ...

it will .

open it up .

you look right through him . he 's there , but there 's something on the other side of him that you want . it 's all you want . and whatever 's in the way does n't matter ... . then it 's easy .

you missed on purpose .

you ca n't say that ... .

valentine ...

it 's friday ... .

do you think i ...

i was just trying to make a point . if --

none whatsoever . but i have to admit , i 'm not terribly surprised .

probably not , but i still do n't have the nerve to tell him .

yes . not like enzo .

yes , is n't it wonderful ? i 'm so happy . i 'll bet i 'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world !

remember when i went to italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium . well , we were n't being cheated by the mafia or anybody except maybe by me ... ... do they come for lunch everyday ? i really went on my own business , to see a man that i happen to be in love with ... and i 'm glad i did it , but i 'm sorry about the policy and i 'll be happy to make up the money the company did n't get ... of course just now i do n't have ... one million , four hundred and ten thousand dollars . but if you were to dock my salary , say , twenty dollars a week , in a few hundred years we 'd be even ... and i think this is where you fire me ?

we have to send somebody over there immediately ! if we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy . we 'll be off the hook . there 's a flight to rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to sicily .

the documents are forged .

my god ! i 'm glad i did n't go .

he can learn . he is learning .

what else is there ?

you going to sleep here , all by yourself ?

and the lights ! running lights , stealing stretchers ... ! you 'll have us in jail .

he looks me in the eye like some fuckin ' gold fish , and says : `` i 'm going to beat you '' .

what was he like , when he was little ?

have you known him long ?

you 'll be lovely , but no thanks . jacques , would you do a native dance for me ?

i 'll take you there . we 'll live in the sun . you 'll cook fresh fish and we 'll make love under the coconut trees .

no .

johana cross , pleased to meet you . well ! is n't this a coincidence . i really was n't expecting this ... all the way out here . it 's incredible !

in my village , we have a saying : when the wind blows , the flags of all nations flap in the same direction .

lira ?

roberto ? how long ?

and ... does the voice come back ?

it 's nothing . it 's just the helium , because of the air pressure .

i did n't say ... brussels !

plenty of women everywhere right ?

you say that because you have the title !

that 's good .

thank you , thank you very much !

he does n't like us .

you still collect them ?

tell me , why do n't you go and get your medal ?

why ? are they what 's most important ?

you do n't have a room ? paolo ? what did i just hear ? i personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend jacques mayol and you treat him like a stranger ? !

i do n't want to be in any competition ... i dive because i like to , not to beat a record ... do n't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him ?

enzo ...

who ?

jacques ... ?

i 'm putting you on the coin ... your essence ... that way you 'll always be with me when i dive .

i 'm being a pain , huh ?

well , then , talk to me some more .

because one should n't fall in love with creatures from the sea .

i 'd better get back now .

i 'm glad you stayed . thank you .

give it to me .

i guess ... but you know ... i 'm american and i 've mostly been taught to be competitive ... there 's always pleasure of being the best ?

... okay . i 'll try .

no , no . you 'll like it . it 's superb .

no ... in the hut .

yes sir , and it has been so for 127 years .

i 'm going to put a lock on the telephone . did you bring the cassettes ?

uncle louis , we have a guest !

good . that way i 'll see more of you ... where are you going to stay ?

where are you from , henrietta ?

are you crazy ? i have no use for a woman ! since my accident .

way past it .

... yes ?

so why the long face ?

i 'm gon na pay a visit to the k.l.f . see if they 've got the 411 on santa 's location . i 'll check in with you when i know more .

mordechai , i love you . i could n't let you do this alone .

what are you doing here ?

i 'm sorry esther , i just do n't think we can see each other romantically anymore .

when did you guys have this conversation ? when i was in the bathroom ? what else did she have to say ?

you mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke ... oh . i get it .

oh !

shabat shalom mama . i brought some manischewitz . the black label .

i understand that . i just thought that you might want to know .

happy hanukkah morty .

man , that 's far out ! hey , the jets won !

it 's cool . it 's cool . aveenooh shalom alechem , brother .

i 'm back on the job for the jdl . you hear about that crazy white boy who took over as santa ?

so morde-chai , tell me , what brings your bad self down to the klf ?

i shlepped all the way to the north pole for this ? i come to fight you , and you do n't even put out anything to nosh on ? what kind of arch nemesis are you ?

excuse me ? do i know you , friend ? take a look around you . do you even know who i am ?

no . i 'm airsick you asshole ! where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly ?

why do you ask so many questions ? what difference does it make how carlos and i feel ? feeling does not buy clothes and houses !

mmmyes .

what arroyo - how did you get to it

you found the leopard !

up at the museum .

let 's get in your truck .

see you tomorrow -

you 'll meet a rich man and he will give , you money .

i saw teresa . maybe i was the last to see her except perhaps her mamacita and her little brother . i was going past --

at four . he will be there at four .

maybe . for three years i 've sung in rats ' nests , while jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance . we 're due for a little luck !

why do yo & amp ; i accuse me ? you do n't know what you 're doing -- you do n't understand -- nobody understands --

he 'd act normally when he was with other people . it would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over .

some other time .

come on , charlie . let 's go find another and better suspect .

some crazy guy .

i can understand what you mean - demented men , pathological cases . but what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard ?

charlie likes his leopard .

charlie does n't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery .

why ?

that 's right , of course .

yes . i want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody .

you 're worrying about its killing someone else ?

i thought they came right past here

of course . only i 'm afraid you 'll be cheated . there is n't much of a view of the procession here .

there 's a little museum here in town . they 've hired me to run it , we 've some interesting exhibits of indian arts and crafts . it 's fun -- and i like living here in new mexico .

jerry told me you were an expert with animals , mr. galbraith . could n't you tell where it went ?

you think galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse .

nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time .

it 's all right . i 'm not hurt .

we will

i 'm no detective . i do n't even know how to begin . all i know is i want to do something about all this .

why do you want to stay around here ? it 'll only make you feel badly .

and did you find the leopard ?

and i suppose you do n't feel bad !

now look what you 've done .

look , kicks , how long have we known each other ?

on his back , i suppose .

listen , kicks , you 'll never guess what i 've cooked up this tine ...

kiki -- he wo n't hurt you . there 's nothing to be afraid of .

that would be mrs de moraes mother , sir . mr and mrs spitz are here with their daughter .

i dont know . everyones dead ...

my parents flew back from israel ... told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce . he flew back to brazil ... and his drowning was arranged ...

where is that ?

something like that .

i didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet , mr lombard !

you splendid bastard ...

think what you like . but dont presume to understand .

one just doesnt ... tell me , what does one speak about , huh ?

your brother stumbled upon adoniss little secret , didnt he ? and traded his silence for a kid and some cash . and adonis fell for it , bought him his kid , sent him away , and then killed him when he came back for more . leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints . he came to extort a second kids life . your flunkey let him in , so his visit couldnt be concealed , hence the exhibition story . there was no exhibition . just as you suspected . remember , deborah ? leon does his own prints . wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his art . i should have paid more attention to your words . perhaps its the way you say them ...

you watched the tape ? friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes , mrs de moraes . theyre in the import-export business . they run hotels here in london which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise .

who is friedman ?

oh no . youll have to do better than that , mr lombard .

oh-oh ! touch , mr lombard ! but tell me , what would you know about sisterly love , eh ? no . dont . you might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear- headed , at least until youve done what we are paying you for .

a call box ? thats odd . where exactly ?

crow what ?

a coffee and a couple of croissants .

my ex-husband . my work drove him away . made his life a misery . he thinks im obsessed , punishing myself for what happened to our son . but hes a good guy . hell listen to you . he wont turn you in if i ask him not to . i can pretty much guarantee that . okay ?

its up to you whether they walk or not .

no one saw me but the italian and a dog . i blew up their generator . they thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing . it might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up ...

italian ? the mafia ... ?

some italian i picked up back there . hes in the boot of the mustang .

so who ... whos the man ? where is he ?

did you not enter this country illegally ?

did you call me up here to enjoy yourself , emily , or to let me use your phone ? because we seem to have a slight problem ...

hah ... what about nathalie ?

have you never heard of collect calls , mr ...

no . youre looking at a real musketeer here , whitney . brave and rash . had to dash in there . take a prisoner ... might as well have sent them a notice to quit ... come on , musketeer ! got anything to say ?

look at him , whitney . come all the way from england to clean up california . huh !

if you have hard evidence about a child trafficker , we want it , mr lombard . and we want it before you get yourself killed ...

fifteen for a straight delivery . twenty with the provision of a safe place . visitors tend to find the second option more convenient .

what about an untrained pup , white ...

yes ... good , good ...

we also provide 24-hour after-sale service . were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die , we would unburden you , you understand ?

i saw the ad at georges . im passing through town and im in a hurry .

what colour is your car ? what colour is your car ?

where are we ?

yes . friedmans the fuckin austrian !

jee ... fuck ... youre fucking mad !

got it . puppies .

ill call again .

what are you up to , eh , savieer ? i mean , not this but ... money , passports , a gun in a microwave ? who are you , eh ? who are you ?

so you havent seen the film , then ?

ha ... no , mr lombard . his monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us . he knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate .

when ... im told he came here ...

i take it your son is not married , mrs spitz ?

the hyatt ... ? whats that ?

you seem very sure about that .

who are you ? who are you working for , huh ?

im overcome by your public-spiritedness .

money talks , bullshit walks , whether you like it or not .

where is friedman ?

huh , i doubt it ... friedman only deals directly with select customers . i handle the rabble ...

clients come and go .

what are you talking about ?

ill be alone .

an austrian ... not much to go on , is it ?

and while visiting our fair city you ... an austrian ?

whats the date ?

i cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway . my number if anything happens . whats your sisters number ?

yes ... you-youre not going to take shiva away ?

is she on the phone ?

yeah ... but he didnt beat the demons ... a quarter of all the shoes sold in europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire . all started from a small shop in the east end of london and war reparation money for holocaust victims .

you-youre wrong . i just called to ask if i could stay with him next time im in london . thats all .

los angeles ?

i didnt think so . the rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with ... i dont wan na know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in owl canyon . but you might as well know id have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this ...

what about which girlfriend ?

we are so alike , xavier . still , sometimes i wonder which one of us is the ugliest .

alors ?

what do you think , huh ?

why did you kill him ?

are they still operative ?

it 's a miracle she 's not dead !

here ... to help pay jeanne 's ransom . all the captains gave what they could , as well as the citizens of orleans and the other towns she saved ...

that 's a good idea , sire .

did your voices tell you that ? you told me you had n't heard them for months ...

tell the king to give me more men .

if you really want to help me , there 's one thing you can do .

maybe their silence is a sign ... ? maybe it 's a sign to go home ?

yes ...

the king said you 're his finest archer ... ?

this i can do . i was studying at the university of paris -- till the english invaded it .

better today than tomorrow .

do you think i could have some water ?

we have to press home the attack !

... so you were in the middle of the battlefield , with your sword in your hand , waving it above your head ... charging against the enemy , screaming and yelling ... fighting for your life ... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone ?

and did n't you order the citizens of paris to surrender the city in the name of the king of heaven ?

good advice for the french , not for the english ! do you think god hates the english ?

well find some other way ! be creative . tell them she fucks the devil ... hmm , not a bad idea ... why ca n't you say that ? sounds good to me ... and who can prove she does n't ?

scared to make a mistake . supposing she 's right ... supposing she really has been sent by god ? ?

well what are you waiting for ? you 've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys : go and torture the bitch !

... and your prerogative is to find her guilty ...

i understand your impatience , but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and ...

where ... where am i ?

i was talking to the priest , and do you know what he said to me ?

i -- i ca n't jeanne ... i ca n't hear your confession ... i 'm sorry ...

it 's not my body i want to save . it 's my soul .

as often as you like -- now , please -- for the love of god -- sign ! !

your trial , jeanne . on a charge of heresy .

then her faith will have to be bigger .

i ... i ca n't stop her .

you will ? ?

your health and happiness has always been my first concern , charles ... ever since you were a little boy -- and i think i know you better than your own mother ...

ah , jeanne ... come here ... ! this whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco ... nothing is ready ...

let them come ! let them see who 's the true king of france !

his face .

may i , without offending you , inquire how generous ?

i know ... but the english want her very badly , and i have to tell you that they are proving much more generous .

jeanne , what are you doing with that ... you 've got it back to front ...

the wind will be against us ...

sooner is better than later !

god .

we offer the english a last chance to return home in peace . if they refuse , we recross the river and attack them here -- at the tourelles .

so ... what is the message ?

i know ...

it 's coming -- i rode on ahead . i have to speak with the captain of the english army ... his name 's talbot ...

as long as she brings food and supplies , she 'll be welcome .

he never sent them ... do n't you understand ? he does n't want this war anymore ... he has his crown now , that 's all he ever wanted ...

jeanne ... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers .

reinforcements ? where ? ?

maybe ... i do n't know ... but first we have to confess ...

no ... not like this ...

no ... !

did your voice tell you to jump ?

here -- take this instead .

besides , what about these ... ?

jeanne ... the man has n't been paid for six months -- that 's his only reward . let him take a few teeth ...

what 's the use ? the drawbridge is up !

i swear i 'll never swear again in my life if you save her life ! but i 'm warning you , if you let her die , then you 're the biggest ...

and you look pretty wealthy for a servant of god , would n't you say ?

yes , i was given a few , but i never had time to wear them ...

because ... because i do n't know what else to do to please him .

no , but ... why did n't he stop it ? or did he get pleasure , watching us killing each other in his name ?

is he the one who spread all this blood and misery ?

you mean god said , `` i need you , jeanne ? ''

because ! because i 've always been faithful to god , and i 've followed everything he said ... and i 've done everything he asked me ...

no , no -- you ca n't stay or they wo n't come !

they 're going to come and visit you in here ?

why ? are you waiting for someone else ?

what are you doing here ? please ... leave ... you ca n't stay here ...

i am true -- to my lord , the king of heaven . he knows how much i love him -- that 's all that matters to me ...

and what exactly is it that you ca n't take anymore of ?

nothing . i 'm here to set you free ...

i realize your anger , jeanne , but we must learn to forgive . it 's hard , but revenge will never bring about peace .

how long have you been married ?

american jews , and there 's lots of them , what have they done for us ? what do they think they 're doing ? people here are dying , have n't got a bite to eat . the jewish bankers over there should be persuading america to declare war on germany !

for what ? for my tie ?

how will we sleep ?

what 's happened ?

i 'm on the run !

i 'll be fine .

oh my god , it 's terrible , you 've got to do something , oh my god !

what , i 'm working , what ?

then there 's nothing i can do . he should 've joined us when i gave him the chance..

yes , please .

henryk , i said nothing bad .

yes , that 's why i brought it .

what 's the matter ? are you sick ?

you go to heller , did i ask you to talk to him ?

well , you know what 's funny ? you 're funny with that ridiculous tie .

you know what we do ? we use psychology .

what good ? wladek , i 'm surprised at you . they died with dignity , that 's what good it did . and you know something else ? now the poles will rise . we 're ready . we 'll fight , too . you 'll see .

five hundred . you know how many people on average read one copy ? twenty . that makes ten thousand readers . these will start the uprising . majorek hides them in his underpants . and leaves them in toilets .

you 're an artist , wladek , you keep people 's spirits up . you do enough .

i was listening , kitten .

pig !

what d'you think i mean , kitten ? i forgot , that 's what i mean .

sorry , i do n't remember .

you do n't remember me , mr. szpilman ?

szpilman . good name for a pianist .

szpilman .

where do you live ?

to be deaf ?

careful ! watch his hand .

i 'm in .

so could shaw .

on the nose ! i said place . place it on syphon . that horse is going to run second .

but who says you will . i got a guy i can depend on . he 's liquidating everything he has for this . you would n't even give carver his money back .

there was n't any way he coulda known we was in there . we made a clean pick on the lock and did n't leave no footprints in the hall . somebody musta wised him up .

what is this ? i got work to do .

right back to california . we 've got to go home and rest up from our vacation .

you know how they are ... sex ...

he 's just around the corner .

i only know i want to marry you ... right now , and --

you took that money from julia 's hand .

what is it ? has he found him ?

he did n't do it -- nick !

is your father still in there ?

that 's what i was going to ask you . he 's disappeared !

not that scrawny little ... . ?

hello , there !

another martini --

and he still wants to marry me !

you 're not missing much . he 's cuckoo .

he can stay home . please , dad , wo n't you ?

yes ... yes .

going to run him through the fluoroscope ?

why not ? you had a perfectly good motive .

he said that father 's in town . he 's been seeing julia right along .

let 's go and see . taxi !

what about this nunheim ?

i 'll check on that . i 'm afraid this is kinder dull for you .

for one thing , he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge .

you 've been there ?

nothing .

i know he 'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers . you ca n't think he had anything to do with it , mr. guild . he was n't the kind of man that ... .

oh , then you did hear from him ?

that 's ridiculous .

that 's nothing . i saw him myself .

they 'll be here . do n't worry . my men are picking them up .

do you think that wynant did it ?

just give me a minute ... . i 'll remember . i 'm not stalling , lieutenant . you know i always come clean with you . gee , it 'd serve me right if you had pinched me ... that 's the afternoon i was ... . wait , i 'll show you ... !

how 'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering ?

you do n't think i had anything to do with it ?

want to take a poke at him ?

i could n't go near that woman .

i know .

they 'll be pretty rough with you ... .with your record .

what 'll i do if something comes up ?

i 'm not telling anyone .

i do wish you 'd tell me where you 're going .

it might .

no word at all ?

i have n't been a detective for four years .

because i do n't believe that clyde 's dead ! why , you said yourself you saw him last night .

you should have told them he 'd disappeared .

morelli - you knew julia . was she gypping wynant ?

how is studsy ? i did n't know he was out of stir .

i would n't have any reason to hurt her . she was always on the up and up with me . but that dirty little nunheim -- he got sore cause i clicked with her and he did n't , so he put the finger on me .

i did n't knock julia off .

i got ta talk to you . i want you to tell me something and i want you to give it to me straight . get me ?

you 're going to drive me crazy !

i wish you 'd tell me .

you give such charming parties , mr. charles .

who do you think did it ?

the suspects ! they wo n't come .

why not ?

yup . do n't you want something to eat ?

it was his body that was buried there .

i do n't care - i 'm just used to you , that 's all -- if you let anything happen to him , you 'll never wag that tail again !

sure i will .

he 's just been for a walk .

i wish they 'd stop that . it makes me fidgety . do you think they 'll find him , nick ? he must be in new york ... . where do you think you 're going ?

what 's the matter with you ?

you talk as if i were asta .

it 's not going to hurt me to get up .

oh , it 's a fire hydrant .

yes .

yes . i know all they know about the murder . and i 'm a great hero . the tribune said i was shot twice .

i wish that doctor 'd come . how do you feel ?

breakfast .

but it 's christmas now .

everybody says you were a grand detective .

i wonder if they 've -- i do n't want to hear anything about it .

that last martini .

six martinis . you 're not going to have anything on me .

by the way , how is your father 's side ?

you got types ?

you might have mentioned me first .

i thought so . he even tried to drag me into the gentlemen 's --

i had him out this morning .

hello , baby .

no ... no .

police !

you can save that and tell it to the police . they 'll be here in a minute .

well , that 's a hot one . you a bookkeeper ! when were you ever a bookkeeper ?

yes .

i do n't care what you wanted to tell me . you 're through ! get your things and get out !

it 's like i said ; you do n't really know lieutenant john epps very well , do you ?

if i do n't answer , he 'll know something 's up .

that 's just what things came to . sometimes you ca n't help that . it does n't change me respecting you . and now you let me down . i expected more from you , you know ? i really did . i expected you to --

then i suppose it 'd be insurrection , and i suppose i 'd have to kill you . i suppose .

suppose i do n't go for that ?

it 's murder , and i wo n't be any part of it .

i 'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around . i have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you do n't have the stomach to do what has to be done .

we 're at war .

that 's what he says . he could be a spy , or something .

how 's he going to want the gold ? he could n't even know we had it .

what happened ?

you 've had your say , wes . now leave it .

ready when you are .

all right . let 's break out some utility shovels , lanterns , and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting . me and jaeger 'll climb down , and see what we can see .

move !

otherwise whatever we 're looking for could be anywhere .

should be easy going from here . stay on the pass straight to the dot .

not much of a pass .

we 're not going to find anything standing here . let 's get to climbing .

we can fight . that 's what we 're here for : to fight the iraqis . to help the shi'ites , and the khurds .

ready ?

for climbing .

what are you doing .

they stopped .

i 'd settle for being alive . really . alive would be fine .

there you go , jaeger . just find the buried treasure , and you 're a millionaire .

think we 're going to do it ? think we 're going to war ?

that 's what i hear . do n't matter . girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold .

i do n't know .

no , but i figure now 's a real good time to start .

to where ?

shoot them !

i just said i would . i do n't think i --

even if they are iraqis probably all they 'll do is take us prisoner for awhile . got to figure we 're still kicking their asses in the war . they do n't want any trouble .

which boarder ? saudi ? kuwait ? syria ?

the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here .

i know what i did just now was crazy , but you got to understand how much i want that gold .

i do n't want to die .

epps ?

sure .

that helicopter passes , and the only thing we 're close to is death .

it stays as it is . we 're halfway home now . let 's not blow it by people getting ideas .

you do n't have to imagine it . not anymore . now all you 've got to think up is what it 's going to buy you .

what does it look like i 'm doing ?

so where do we start ?

they 're doing more than slapping .

that 's going to do it , right ? i 'm going to be okay .

we 're going to get off , all right . we 'll get you off of there . just ... be cool .

oh , god ! oh god !

do n't drink up all of yours , 'cause you are n't getting any of ours .

steady it out !

look at you , not even breaking a sweat . you 're cool , boy . you 're cool .

a car ? you 're going to buy a car ?

but we all got to be in for this . we all go , or we do nothing .

we disappear for awhile . we disappear , we came back ; nobody knows nothing .

another month in this desert and i might just .

i told you , i 'm shooting iraqis .

what does it look like i 'm doing ? i 'm killing iraqis . at-at-at-at-at . at-at- at-at --

i could use some recon photos too .

i 'm looking for a favor . i need a map of iraqi .

maybe we ought to ... you know , bury him . say some words over him .

i 'm getting tired of you riding me , jaeger .

probably would 've too if epps was n't around to stop you .

oh , god !

i do n't know . it would be small , easy to transport and hide . gold or jewels . probably gold .

you 're insane if you think you 'll find anything , and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive .

epps , you 're smarter than this . jaeger i understand , but you 're smarter .

you do n't know where the iraqis have moved to . and our forces have n't even engaged the republican guard yet , we do n't know --

what ! ?

what 's your point , wes ? you have a point ?

i do n't care if there 's a lump of coal in here . i just want to be able to rub epps ' face in it when i crack this thing .

you really think there 's a treasure inside ?

do n't shoot me , i 'm friendly . you can use that when you surrender .

i thought it would be good to know .

oh yeah . accidently .

vocasity

what happened ?

hummmm ... ..

correct .

cortex bonding ... .possible temporary . before you report a possible equipment malfunction , you check the subjects ... . ?

it 's wrong ; so wrong , what we 've done ... .

oh , thx ... hold me , hold me , thx holds her tightly , tears in his eyes . they kiss , and luh hides her head in thx 's chest .

no ... no , no .

no one can see us now we 're alone .

if i take something , you suffer . if i do n't , i stuff ... .

if you ... .if you go back on sedation , you wo n't feel the same way about me . you 'll report me for drug evasion .

what do you think you 're doing ? you 're going to get us arrested .

three ! i 'm going to be late for my shift .

i was so scared ... i did n't know what would happen with you ... once i started . i almost let you go on so many times . it will be worth it , together . when i was alone , i knew .

what 's this ? why did you change it ?

there goes another of your disciples .

thx and me .

incredible !

not very encouraging .

look !

what are you doing here ? you 're not cleared for this area !

it will be good for both of us . i 've got it all arranged .

where 's luh ?

what do you want ?

i 'm only trying to help you .

all the insides are gone !

who ? me ? ... i do n't know .

maternity ward , huhh !

lost sen ! he 'll never find us .

yes ...

yes .

coffee , mike ?

how 's the print coming ?

what ... ?

which one 's which ?

right .

cuz he got the girl , now he 's leaving town .

where you guys at ?

be right back .

i know . i was working a drug ring , deep cover . played the part too well . when they pulled me out , i was n't a cop anymore . my fiance had dumped me . next thing i knew , i was out here on the street , doped up , auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me , cleaned me up , gave me a second chance . he promised captain winters he 'd look out for me .

what not bad . you 've got a series of bombs , devices , that may or may not be connected , set by one or many nutjobs , who may or may not be linked .

` til we get a better lead .

how long are we going to stay ?

industrial wood oil . separately , any one of these things could lead in several directions , but together ...

except they 'll blow you up if you do n't play along .

an abandoned machine shop ... nice place to build devices . low rent , too . but , you and rice ruined their perfect hideout .

oh yeah ? prove it .

no you look , mister ! first , you do n't go calling my men names . it 's bad for morale . second , us `` punks '' happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did .

what do you think ?

assist ? what the hell you know about tickers anyway ?

meg 's lasagna . good eats , reilly . c'mon .

let 's face it , we all knew it would happen sooner or later . the guy who can build a mousetrap that 's better than we are ...

bev , you 're the greatest ...

no , we 're terrorists , stay back or we 'll blow .

thank you .

what ? nobody , i-

no ... no more killing .

you were lucky today , vice boy . captain said to leave it alone , but just remember , i 'm watching you .

lab 's backed up , we 're still waiting for it .

look , it 's important .

oh shit ...

ai n't that a shit --

it do n't work-

take your time ... one day at a time , kid ...

mike ...

we 're vice , i did n't see no pimps or hookers in that van . but if you 're so gung-ho , we 'd best call it in for some back-up .

you outta the city ... that 's a fish out of water . what 's with all this family talk lately , anyway ?

someone who smokes french cigarettes .

so what 're we looking for ?

got it ! ace match company , flint , michigan .

ira - instant retirement account .

device .

reilly , what 's happening ? reilly ! reilly ! do not engage . we 're five minutes-

she 's refused to say a word to anyone . what made you think you could get her to talk ?

no ! but let me tell you -- any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag -- phooey , phooey , phooey !

what ? i may lose it again ? but i have n't found it yet ! i 'm sorry . goodbye ! yes ?

m'sieu laval , m'sieu filiba would like very much to see you .

eleven o'clock !

so i said to myself , `` all right , if he wants to look at them , let him look at them . no harm in that . '' and then he said , `` say ah . '' and then i said , `` ah . '' and that 's all i remember ... and when i woke up , i still had my tonsils , but my pocketbook was gone .

about tonsils .

< u > all < /u > < u > kinds < /u > .

yes !

you 've never been in constantinople ?

no .

smart . london , eh ?

the type they marry .

no color , no sparkle -- but dependable .

i would start with cocktails .

yes , m'sieu . m'sieu giron !

i do n't < u > know < /u > , m'sieu giron !

no , captain , i tell you --

but , lily --

shut up ! do n't make up any stories !

do n't you < u > realize < /u > --

yes , < u > m'sieu < /u > < u > colet < /u > ?

now , lily --

he recognized you !

ah !

what ?

and we 'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we did n't get married !

disappointed ?

you 'd better not . he 's really very dull . but anyhow , when the king tells the marquis he saw me , the marquis will tell the marchesa . and the marchesa is the best friend of the duchess of chambro . and < u > she < /u > will phone the princess de costa . the princess does n't like me -- but i do n't care !

i would like to .

um- < u > hum < /u > ...

i would n't say anything -- i would act .

yes , gaston ?

then why do you want to go ?

you would ?

yes , madame ?

madame .

the same thing .

and you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs , i would give you a good spanking -- in a business way , of course .

everything ! ... madame colet , if i were your father -- which , fortunately , i am not --

early eighteenth century . i should say around -- seventeen thirty .

do you know my first name ?

but really , m'sieu , this is n't necessary .

i remember .

and in that niche , there is a statue of venus .

that 's it ! yes , that 's it ! ... jacques !

yes , madame colet ?

i know !

yes ! and he would have a little more time for --

you see -- oh , not a word to m'sieu laval !

please ! thank you .

yes , madame . you see , i have to get up very early . my little brother goes to school -- you see , mother is dead .

yes , i saw it -- but --

yes , my bag !

your bag ?

how much time ?

we 've put together the world 's largest database on the titanic . okay , here ...

she says she 's rose dewitt bukater , right ? rose dewitt bukater died on the titanic . at the age of 17. if she'd 've lived , she 'd be over a hundred now .

hey , lizzy . i need to talk to you for a second .

bobby , we 're launching . see these submersibles here , going in the water ? take a message .

so do i .

this is ridiculous , lovejoy . find her .

honestly , cal , if you were n't forever booking everything at the last instant , we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family .

i was tired .

i had hoped you would come to me last night .

we got ta get up there or we 're gon na be gargling saltwater . where 's tommy ?

well i can .

you can smell ice , you know , when it 's near .

if you do n't shut that hole in yer face , there 'll be one less in this boat !

ai n't you boys ever rowed before ? here , gim me those oars . i 'll show ya how it 's done .

just a few more minutes . it 'll take them a while to get the boats organized ...

it 's so cold .

that guy lovejoy put it in my pocket .

this is horseshit .

a diamond . a very rare diamond , called the heart of the ocean .

cal , surely you remember mr. dawson .

why ca n't i be like you jack ? just head out for the horizon whenever i feel like it . say we 'll go there , sometime ... to that pier ... even if we only ever just talk about it .

i think you must have had a love affair with her ...

jack .

rose . rose dewitt bukater .

i know what ice fishing is !

no .

you would have done it already . now come on , take my hand .

wait ! can you give us something go on , here . like who had access to the safe . what about this lovejoy guy ? the valet . did he have the combination ?

louis the sixteenth wore a fabulous stone , called the blue diamond of the crown , which disappeared in 1792 , about the time louis lost everything from the neck up . the theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too ... recut into a heart-like shape ... and it became le coeur de la mer . the heart of the ocean . today it would be worth more than the hope diamond .

rose , get in the boat !

do n't look so uncomfortable , lee -- it interferes with your good looks . give me a cigarette . what did you do -- persuade her to come on this voyage with you ?

sure ! you 're never at a loss for words .

any woman 's crazy to feel about a man the way i do about you .

anya !

i hope so .

thanks . i 'll be there . about seven-thirty ?

i 'm going down to my cabin . i have to send a wireless -- see you later .

well , it 'll have to be poker -- but i 'm so unlucky in that game .

you 'll excuse me .

montana ?

stick-up . needed dough to get ashore .

lifted it out of a guy 's cabin last night .

i agree with you -- no gentleman , would -- but i would -- -- especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards .

and me coming in with two pair --

jimmy !

just met her on the boat -- supposed to play bridge with her yesterday -- but she would n't -- so we played poker instead .

good night , idiot !

you 're a little ahead of yourself -- the usual routine would be for you to propose , and if i accept , then you 'd give me an engagement ring --

will you take some advice ? if you 're looking for romance -- count me out -- -- if you know what 's good for you .

i ca n't blame the ocean -- it 's you .

see you at seven-thirty in the lounge .

you asked me to dine with you tonight .

what a horrible death ! do you know what you remind me of ?

married ?

aw -- give a feller a break . my cards are on the table -- i want to know you . how about dining with me tonight ?

-- sorry -- got an appointment to play shuffle-board .

there 's soft music --

good-by !

do n't thank me . do you recognize me without the lipstick ?

i could stand some more --

yes -- are you ?

why -- i -- er thought with all this heat turned on i 'd hide it .

sure -- and to show you i 'm a regular fella -- here 's that twenty-five hundred .

why < u > did n't < /u > i think of that ? -- i am going to scout around and see if i can find her .

you do n't think -- ?

oh , no -- you 're not gon na give my hard-earned money away .

we did n't have enough dough for two tickets , did we ?

think again --

well , to tell you the truth , gentlemen , i 've sworn off playing poker .

hope i did n't keep you waiting .

hello , young fellow !

thought you were going to turn in , inspector .

care to join us ?

before that . your face is very familiar .

i do n't know what it is , but i wo n't use it . is she entertaining you ?

that 's all right . i 'll attend to this .

well . i 'd rather see < u > you < /u > get it than the company .

sure .

that 's right . i owe you a dollar sixty .

how ?

how ?

that 's news to me . i 'd better cable my wife .

well , did you find me ?

that 's right -- you 're the one i was looking for . you 'll excuse me . how about you and i being alone ?

he 's funny -- maybe you can use him in the show , mr. denby .

yes !

i did n't --

maybe he just travels in bad company .

i get it -- lee lother have a hand in that , too ?

news travels fast on broadway -- you had to get away from a rat --

oh , -- i was having so much fun i almost forgot --

but , mary -- everybody 's having such a great time -- why spoil it ?

they 're a cinch to read -- queen of clubs -- -- ace of diamonds .

looks lonesome -- bring him over here .

have you ever figured they might extradite you ?

do n't , lee -- that 's dead .

a tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and --

he 's a swell person . he told me he 'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million .

i hope so . well , i guess you two can do without me . i 'll be seeing you .

that 's the truth -- every single word !

it 's getting kind of chilly on deck . if you 'll excuse me , i think i 'll go to bed . good night , mr. mckinney !

`` smooth 's '' the word .

i 'll explain later --

ai n't got time .

that 's wyatt earp . made quite a name for himself as a peace officer in kansas .

no ...

look at that ! yeah ! come and get some , boy !

this brand .

come on , you ...

i was kidding about that .

that 's just my game .

he 's drunk .

very instructive

perfect , wyatt . simply perfect .

you know , frederic-fucking-chopin .

what ?

hey , is that `` old dog tray '' ? sounds like `` old dog tray '' .

sheriff , may i present a pair of fellow sophisticates , turkey creek jack johnson and texas jack vermillion ? watch your ear , creek .

told you . i 'm red hot , i 'm blazin ' ! now , red seven . seven stinkin ' diamonds . look out ! five thousand ! let 's go !

but i 'd do it , i 'd get that one into him . so help me god , i would .

see how she breezed out of here . like she had wings . funny thing but i ca n't really remember how she looked . i can remember parts of her clear as crystal , her mouth , her walk , how she shut her eyes when she laughed , little bits and pieces , but not the whole package . ca n't put it together for some reason .

no .

no .

yeah . or undertakers .

did you ever see the sun come up over the rockies ? it hits all of a sudden and below there 's california and you swear you 're looking at heaven .

you did . well ... thank you .

well you 'll always be sadie to me .

and i do n't even know your full name .

i do n't know , make some money , have some kids , you know .

what about her ?

why do n't you get rid of him and get yourself straight dealer ?

wyatt , what 're you talkin ' about ?

really ? you sure ?

long as i live i 'll never get used to that sound .

there they are . no herd though .

well in that case , i saw your horse . billy clanton was takin ' him up to the cut to show him off . the boys 're all up there right now , branding . and in a mood . still want your property back , mr. private citizen ?

i 'm not a lawman , i 'm just a private citizen getting ' my property back

mcmasters , is n't it ? listen , you seen a black stallion with-

you were right . it 's nothin ' like i thought . i almost wish ...

how you doin ' , boy ?

i know . and nobody can make him .

doc wo n't quit , been up 36 hours . clanton came in an hour ago , they switched over to poker . tried to get him to bed but he just wo n't let go .

really ? what about hell ? they got a sign or what ?

listen mister , i 'm getting ' tired-

well i 'm real scared .

bundle up , virge . cold out there .

wyatt , i know what i 'm doin ' .

virge , you 're makin ' the arrest . you make contact , i 'll back you up . morgan 'll back me up , doc 'll keep an eye out for trouble . and keep your hands on your guns . they even look like they 're gon na start something , buffalo 'em . right over the head .

get bond out of there .

take the girl . leave the handcuffs . we 'll drown her at sea .

chernobyl will look like a campfire .

so why did you leave ?

i can feel your pain .

come . let 's get out of the noise . - i 'll give you a tour of the building , then we 'll talk .

mr. bond ! nice to see you .

how did you get this number ?

no , 007. it 's just that i 've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want - somehow the reality is never as ... satisfying as the fantasy .

in the darkest moments , it 's what i live for . especially since i 've heard how much you like to watch ... on the hidden camera .

retired . i 'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore .

yes , the ship is down there . but the gold is gone .

just hold me .

it 's on the boat . he 's holding a press conference tomorrow .

is that any way to say hello ?

i believe q 's exact words were : `` hopefully , nothing . ''

oh . i almost forgot . there is one last thing : before q retired , he asked that i give you one other protective device .

finally , your new watch : blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks ; press this button , the sweep hand becomes a geiger counter .

it was an authorized test . i returned the money .

i 'm not certain ... but i think there 's someone i want to press for some answers in kuala lumpur .

i got you covered .

who knows ? fog , night ...

hell . the cia built that club .

what do you want with the harbor master ?

i do n't know if you 'd call it a boat ...

wade , what the hell are you doing here ?

... yes ?

what do you mean , you 'd rather die alone ?

next time , i do the driving .

up .

wait here .

- shut up !

i 'll keep that in mind .

the strait can be a very dangerous place , mr. bond . a few words scribbled on a piece of paper in london does n't carry a lot of value out here . including life insurance .

chaperone . i 'm waiting for my dinner date .

hopefully , it wo n't get that far .

you 're to wear this mask at the venice carnival , and wait to be contacted .

of course . minister johnstone .

i was just getting to the interesting part !

you have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way .

chew up a log like that in the propeller , you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to london . twice .

check it again . what about the global positioning satellite ? could there be something wrong with the signal ?

my timing always was lousy .

no matter what the british government says , i wo n't kill this story . miss oxford will show both of you to the elevator ... and one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later .

... well ! i do believe this requires further investigation !

take the men . i can finish alone .

bore through . ... they used to say living well was the best revenge , mr. bond . they 're wrong . revenge is the best revenge .

please , sidney . i 'd like to remember you fondly .

do n't worry . mr. bond will get the message . so will his boss .

... but because i am a just man , i 've decided to give mr. hussein what he deserves .

kim dae yung . north korean nuclear specialist .

junior spends time with his child .

why , you do n't want us to bring him over ?

your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother 's birthday was last week .

what time is it ? do you think you can just treat us like your slave ? it 's after one .

like a veil has been lifted ?

i have more sense than to give up everything , my family , you and sunny . it was n't me , i mean the real me inside my body . i 'm glad it 's over . it 's like a veil has been lifted .

i do n't need that kind of love . and i do n't want to be reminded all the time that big mama 's grandmother was born in slavery . if you really care about me , just tell me how i can make money .

have you lost your mind ? have you thought about your wife and child , not to mention your sick father ? and i need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling .

harry is coming to pick me up .

i was hoping you came to the door instead of him . it gets cold at night .

who is it ?

now how far would further out be ?

it 's only a tale .

i will appreciate that .

just stay in bed and rest .

no , i 'm too hot now .

babe brother is a poor boy .

you know , babe brother 's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them .

hush .

you and babe brother are so much alike ...

it has n't been the years ; it 's been the men in her life .

my daddy called me boy up to the time he died . i was always boy to him .

i 'm worn out but wo n't you feel like you are taking in a stranger ?

let me get you a cup ?

i hope that it 's nothing serious .

she has a fish bone caught in her throat . could all of you go in the other room ? gideon , get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil .

what 's the problem here ?

i have someone i want you to meet .

good evening . it must be all the different time zones i crossed that makes me feel this weary .

you damn right they did n't , especially emory , my cousin .

those boys never did have good luck .

there is something that i always wanted to know . tell me , how did those boys die ?

i do n't know if we could take one in with rhonda and me at home alone at times .

how many people do you all feed ?

that 's nice .

i already have , my dear .

my mother passed on years ago .

girl , do you still sing and dance ?

he should be caring . that is not too much to ask .

country people got so many strange ways ,

i remember harry always trying to help someone . he got lulla 's daughter out of trouble . he was always running to the store for someone who could n't leave the house .

i have n't heard anyone mention swamp root since button-up shoes went out .

we ca n't really bring another family in here with us .

i know you did n't but you have been so thoughtful .

i could n't find my buzz . i know i left him right there .

oh , all this packing makes me hungry . what would you say to dinner at , uh , oh , pizza planet ?

it 's a long story , bo . i 'll explain later . here , catch this !

you 'd think they 've never seen a new toy before .

hey , buzz ! ! you 're flying ! !

great !

it 's ok. everything 's under control .

come on , this way !

oh , you idiot ! you 're a toy ! use your karate chop action !

i sure hope this is n't permanent .

you mean that happy child ?

oh , no , no , no ... buzz , look ! an alien !

what are you talking about ? where 's that bonding strip ? !

they are a terillium-carbonic alloy and i can fly .

ho-yaaahh ! ! !

plus is positive , minus is negative ! oh , let me !

are you peeking ?

i ca n't see a thing !

what ?

who would 've thought he was capable of such atrocities ? !

oh , ya big lizard ! now we 'll never know what it is !

toss 'im overboard !

did you all take stupid pills this morning ? ! have you forgotten what he did to buzz ? and now you want to let him back over here ?

wait ! wait ! i got a better idea ! how about we do n't ? !

who is it this time ?

hey look ! it 's buzz !

hi ya , fellas . to infinity and beyond !

i was close to being scared that time .

i ca n't quite make out --

there .

okay , we 're on the last present now ...

that 's right . your toys .

huh ?

i ca n't hold on much longer !

no , slink --

all the time .

i thought she was fondest of you , because you were the youngest .

almighty jove in the shape of a swan .

he 'll be looking for another apprentice .

you did what ?

ah , you should see the swan ! his masterpiece . now , walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell .

is that all ?

he can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf , but , his bite is worse than his bark , is n't that so , old fellow ?

is there anything else i should know about him ?

curled up on the landing like love locked out !

you 'll put your clothes here .

is she in any kind of therapy ... professional help ?

still , this was a sensitive issue for me and i wanted to thank you personally .

i want to believe you . i really do .

he never came home last night . was he with you ?

that is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us .

i tried , arnie . and , i will continue to try .

do n't you have some good news ? is n't there something positive you could say .

laundromats for the washing of money . unfortunately , carl had only one successful business .

arnie , i need money . somebody threatened my children . they want a first payment of three million dollars .

goodbye arnie .

you had it all figured out . you move into my house . you raise my kids . you sleep with my wife . it was a good plan , arnie .

where are you going ?

at least she 's alive .

so 's the video camera .

god , i do n't get it . are we supposed to say to ourselves , be prepared to lose her , be prepared to lose our child ? why does this happen to someone ? how does it happen ?

we do n't want to push her away . these are growing experiences .

like a grateful dead concert .

hi .

yeah .

... how old are you ?

have you done your homework , honey ?

he 's gon na fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --

are you kidding ... i 'm staying with you --

what are you doing ?

maradona is a cokehead . hand of god , my ass . we 're wasting our time here .

i have dreams about this , actual dreams about busting the top people , the rich people , the white people .

move 'em to texas , fry 'em up .

i feel good .

what would a law firm want from the new drug czar ?

yeah !

not tiger woods .

ca n't you for a second imagine none of this had happened ? that my drugs had gone through . what would have been the harm ? a few people get high who are getting high anyway . your partner is still alive . we avoid having breakfast together . do n't you see this means nothing ? that your whole life is pointless ?

in mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity , this is not so true for the usa . using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search . the odds are not high , and we found variables that reduce the odds . we hire drivers with nothing to lose . then we throw a lot of product at the problem . some get stopped . enough get through . it 's not difficult .

yes , sir !

i 'm six months pregnant . i wo n't do it .

we have the ability to change the color , odor , and physical property of cocaine .

what ?

madrigal 's alive .

yeah .

a place we have , that we know is protected .

is it possible to have a drug czar in mexico who is n't connected in some war to one of the cartels ?

just tell me where she is .

i 'll pay you a thousand dollars . i have it in my wallet .

i have money --

i need to find my daughter . i 'll pay you .

i do n't give a fuck about your parents --

i mean , who runs interdiction on the mexico side ?

what do we do ? okay . fucked-up bowman 's turning blue . doctor . we need a doctor .

well , i 've not brought them .

you daft cunt . if you 're going to waste it like that , you might as well leave it all to me . now get the drinks in .

i want the money , mark , that 's all .

ninteen .

but it 's not worth more than fifteen .

not sorry enough for being a fat cunt .

two thousand , one hundred and thirty- three pounds .

happy birthday .

it 's so simple . we buy it at four grand , we punt it at twenty to this guy that sick boy knows , and he punts it at sixty . everyone 's happy , everyone 's in profit . i put up two . i come away with six .

yes , as a matter of fact , it is .

no , not holding hands .

and do n't make any noise .

come on .

ssshh !

diane .

i 'll come back if you like , but i 'm not promising anything .

exactly . i 'm not wanting a cat , she says . get to fuck , right . so there 's tommy stuck with this kitten . you can imagine what happened . the thing was neglected , pissing and shitting all over the place . tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers . he did n't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit .

thank you , mr. murphy . we 'll let you know .

sorry about last night -

i 'm sorry , tommy .

following the game at all ?

another dab ?

if they think you 're not trying , you 're in trouble . first hint of that , they 'll be on to the dss , 'this cunt 's no trying ' and your giro is fucking finished , right ?

we 're two thousand short .

so ?

i got a good price for it . rents , i need the money .

when are you going to visit him ?

cut it out .

oh no , do n't even mention it .

eughh . sounds horrible .

you can look it up .

director ?

sure .

great .

the sick boy method .

sure , sure . i 've heard it before .

are you serious ?

it 's the great outdoors .

so what 's it going to be ?

went ballistic ?

my pain ?

the ship ... .

why ? why have you done this to my friend ?

this starship , could it carry my wisdom beyond the barrier ?

we sought only your infinite wisdom .

rescued at last .

new course ? you have no authority . what 's going on here ?

plotting our new course .

all right , we 're lost . but we 're making good time .

closing .

what 's going on ?

a federation starship .

understood . kirk out .

have faith , my friend . there are more of us than you know .

what do you know of my pain ?

captain , we 're receiving transmission from paradise city . they 're demanding to know our intentions .

standard orbit , mr. sulu .

er ... you forgot to take it with you .

i was thinking of sybok . i 've lost a brother .

spock ?

spock ... do n't .

`` c. '' ... `` k . ''

new word . `` b '' .. `` a '' ... um ...

i am here , captain .

the designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find . he failed to escape .

i did not .

look , the man may be a fellow vulcan , but that does n't ...

forgive you ? i ought to knock you on your goddamn ass !

worse . i have betrayed you . i do not expect you to forgive me .

yes , captain .

yes , captain ?

what do you mean ?

there was a young student , exceptionally gifted , possessing of great intelligence . it was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of vulcan . but he was a revolutionary .

who is it he reminds you of ?

i can not be certain .

goodnight , doctor .

come on , spock . why did n't you jump in ?

`` row , row , row your boat ... '' i love `` row ... '' do - do you know `` row , row , row , row , row your boat ? ''

and that is ?

given to me by god . he waits for us on the other side .

but if we do , will that convince you that my vision was true ?

what are you doing ?









no . sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we 've always been afraid to express .

i do n't understand ...

you did break in .

frustrating . i had tron almost ready to run , and dillinger cut everybody with group 7 access out of the system .

yes , wo n't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking , and people will stop . lora , i 'm going to stay and run some data through . see you tomorrow .

no , it 'll run independently . it can watchdog the mcp as well .

alan . alan bailey .

right on the money !

for sure ...

that all you can say ?

you would n't dare .

i ca n't afford to have an independent program monitoring me . do you have any idea how many outside systems i 've gone into ? how many programs i 've appropriated ?

i 'm sorry -

ed , i am so very disappointed in you .

no problem , master-c. if you 've seen one consumer electronics show ... what 's up ?

dumont !

when you 've been in the system as long as i have , you hear many promises ... many reassurances ... many brave plans ...

stranger and stranger ...

flynn , we 've got to help him !

almost ... i just have to adjust our course at the next junction . i 'd better go check the instruments ...

paramus ... wonder what those initials stand for ... ... probably program assist routine -- well , it sounds like a lovely place .

you 're getting out of the business ?

so ... how 's the world of serious science ?

a user ?

do it !

harry only has two moods : busy ... * and asleep .

dinner 's in the warmer . tell your father i may be late .

unbelievable ! trent told me he wrote it . he 's history .

and the second you left there , we started getting calls to the * ghost numbers . they were checking out the renquist front .

he 's got it .

we 're dead , right ? so ... where 'd you put the transmitter ?

is this national security stuff boring you ?

ha ! the little prick ditched you ! that is so goddamn funny .

that 's it . get 'im harry we 'll teach that little puke not to signal .

see , that 's the problem with terrorists . they 're really inconsiderate when it comes to people 's schedules .

hi , i 'm harry renquist . i own a --

nope . the art buys are in a separate ledger .

right . she 's only fourteen .

did you tell her about us , harry ?

you think i care about their * cause ? or yours ? not at all . * see , america is on top now . . * . but so was rome , once . all * civilizations crumble . one nation succeeding over another . what does it mean in the long run ? the only important thing is to live well . and ... living * well takes money . *

hello , harry .

i agree .

dance ?

what are you going to do ?

do you still love me ?

my god . have you had to ... have sex with other women in the line of duty ?

yes .

sodium amytal , maybe some other truth agent .

do n't call me honey ! you do n't ever get to call me honey again . you understand ? ! you pig !

no .

how long have you been a member of his faction ?

i slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks .

that 's fabulous harry .

i 'm late .

okay .

well , think of it as playing a role . it 's fantasy . you have to work on their dreams . get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours .

sure . set me up and then do n't tell me .

like one ?

you can call me simon . you 're very brave to do this ... you opened it .

it 's just that ... it 's been sixteen years since anyone but harry did that , i --

i 'm married !

yes . now go .

ssshhh ! we say op . covert * operation . and this one got a little rough .

yes . go ahead .

hello ?

do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now ? your phones are almost certainly tapped . and you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this renquist , who may be a --

what letter ?

i thought it was what you wanted , clarence .

it 's got a nice ring to it . it sounds like a movie . `` clarence and alabama go to cancoon '' . do n't 'cha think ?

i used to live by one back in dearborn . it 's real frustratin ' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ai n't got shit . i hated where i was , but i could n't do anythin ' about it . i did n't have enough money . it was tough enough just tryin ' to pay my rent every month , an ' here i was livin ' next to an airport . whenever i went outside , i saw fuckin ' planes take off drownin ' out my show . all day long i 'm seein ' , hearin ' people doin ' what i wanted to do most , but could n't .

i think what you did was ...

so i can go over there and pick up your things .

what ?

hello , mrs. worley .

you better not be fuckin ' teasin ' me .

thank you . i wan na see you again too . and again , and again , and again . bama , i know we have n't known each other long , but my parents went together all throughout high school , and they still got a divorce . so , fuck it , you wan na marry me ?

he thinks he is . he says his mother was apache , but i suspect he 's lying .

uh-huh .

you 're not stupid . just wrong .

do you get paid a lot ?

almost four years .

mickey rourke , somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life , like elvis 's voice , good kung fu , and a tasty piece of pie .

what kinda music do you like ?

might be from tallahassee . but i 'm not sure yet .

would you like to get some pie ?

i love to get pie after a movie .

nothing . it 's just you 're a girl after my own heart .

alabama whitman . pleased to meet ya .

sonny kicks ass .

the oriental in black . he 's an assasin . now , at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had . so he got himself arrested . they take him into the police station . and he starts kickin ' all the cops ' asses . now , while keepin ' them at bay , he finds the guy he was supposed to kill . does a number on him . kicks the cops ' asses some more . kicks the bars out of the window . and jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him .

tell him to look through it .

has he looked through it yet ?

the forager 's back .

take that shit somewhere else .

you 're tellin ' him what he wants to hear , but that ai n't the same thing as kissin ' his ass .

oh , and your line to charles atlas in there : `` i 'll take that gun '' , `` you 'll have to '' .

all anybody saw was clint eastwood drinkin ' coffee .

yeah .

what ?

where the fuck is that bitch ?

well , if we 're not gon na do it , let 's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here .

in case they try to kill us . i do n't know , what do you want me to say ?

shut up ! first you come waltzing into my life after two years . you 're married . you killed a guy .

i 'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand . how difficult can that be ?

do you have any idea how difficult that 's gon na be ?

tell me .

i certainly hope so .

did you meet captain kirk ?

well , there 's a story behind all that . i 'll tell you when i see you . by the way , i wo n't be alone . i 'm bringing my wife with me .

how 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight ?

i 'd fuck elvis .

yeah ?

well , i guess it 's about that time .

do i look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like french vanilla ice-cream ?

duh . what else would i be talking about ? now stop askin ' stupid doorknob questions . well , a year and a half ago , this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour . he snagged this coke . but , he 's a good cop with a wife and a kid , so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust .

ha ha ha . no really , where does it come from ?

it tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years . it covers the whole spectrum of fans , the people who love his music , the people who grew up with him , the artists he inspired - bob dylan , bruce springsteen , and the fanatics , like these guys . i do n't know about you , but they give me the creeps .

thank you very much , clarence .

do tell . why drug related ?

look , goddamnit , i never asked you for a goddamn thing ! i 've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible . after mom divorced you , did i ask you for anything ? when i would n't see ya for six months to a year at a time , did you ever get your shit about it ? no , it was always `` ok '' , `` no problem '' , `` you 're a busy guy , i understand '' . the whole time you were a drunk , did i ever point my finger at you and talk shit ? no ! everybody else did . i never did . you see , i know that you 're just a bad parent . you 're not really very good at it . but i know you love me . i 'm basically a pretty resourceful guy . if i did n't really need it i would n't ask . and if you say no , do n't worry about it . i 'm gone . no problems .

could you find out if they know anythin ' ? i do n't know they know shit about us . but i do n't wan na think , i wan na know . you could find out for sure what 's goin ' on . daddy ?

what do you want from me ?

go to the liquor store - where is there a liquor store around here ?

i 'm talkin ' about a massacre . they snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there . wouldda gotten away with it , but your son , fuckhead that he is , left his driver 's license in a dead guy 's hand . a whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks .

step inside .

he 's bluffin ya , elliot . ca n't you see that ? you 're an actor , remember , the show must go on .

he knows something 's up .

he knows .

you 're a fuckin ' star ! and you 're gon na be playin ' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin ' years for a captive audience -

or a bit player -

shit , man , you done fucked up again . next time you bogart your way into a nigger 's crib , an ' get all his face , make sure you do it on white boy day .

what was i sayin ' ?

that 's bullshit .

you 're right . it is .

naw , they ai n't stayin ' here . but , i know who you 're talkin ' about . they 're stayin ' at the hollywood holiday inn .

exactly room-mates .

are you dick ritchie ?

shut your mouth . nick cardella was provin ' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy 's nutsack . what sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on nick cardella ? nick cardella 's a stand-up guy .

i understand . there 'd be no point .

i told you that fuckhead mason would get us into something like this .

right ! you 're right . i have to fix this .

i know this place ! ... this is my dream .

i remember you ... like this . i feel i 've known you before . i feel i 've always known you .

if we ca n't change anything ... because it 's already happened , then we ought to at least smell the flowers .

you said i had delusions -- that i created a world -- you said you could explain everything ...

i do n't know -- i do n't remember .

see -- you can drive after all !

what have you done ? did you ... kill someone ?

i thought you did n't know how to drive .

all i see are dead people . everywhere . what 's three more ?

the man ... with the voice . i recognized him . he 's from the present . he ...

who 's keeping an eye on you ?

what do you mean -- when you were a kid ?

does that disturb you , james ? thinking about that little boy in the well ?

clues ? what kind of clues ?

my notes . observations . clues .

do you know what year it is ?

this is april , right ?

you would n't understand .

why not ? most people have some id .

no .

bulishit ! you 're fucking with my head !

they hurt you !

the phone call , man . the phone call .

you see what i mean ? you 're being defensive . is n't she being defensive , bob ?

what virus are we talking about , dad ?

then how come she knows what 's going on ?

james cole . that 's everything we got . none of the james coles on the computer match him . no license , no prints , no warrants . nothing . you want me to go in with you ?

you afraid of the dark ?

i hope you was n't pettin ' him none , was you ?

do n't be sorry . just run over there and get me my pop before i die of thirst .

what 'd you think i was doing out here with these glasses on ? sunnin ' myself ?

hell no , i ca n't do that myself . i 'm blind . ca n't you see that ?

nothing .

twenty-seven , fifty . that 's all i got .

i do n't want no dirty money . i run an honest business .

two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills . and this morning you was broke .

goddamn you ! you son of a bitch !

listen you stupid fuck , i want my car .

what reputation ? you 're nothing but an ignorant , inbred , tumble weed hick .

now that 's too bad . i sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you 're gon na have to work this one off .

what 's that got to do with the radiator hose ?

look , i just want to pick up my car .

accident .

jesus . twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already .

twenty-after-ten .

yeah , i can fix it . got ta run over to the yard and see if i can find a hose like this one , or close enough . gon na take time .

more like jenny is after every man she sees .

he killed him , sheriff ! i could n't stop him ! he made me come with him . he told me if i said a word he would kill me too .

i . . .

oh my god , jake , no . if it is someone they 'll go away . or call the police . do n't go out there .

what does it look like ?

jake , what is that ?

the wind is n't blowing .

you never said anything . about the drapes .

someone will find me .

john , if you do n't throw me the keys , then i 'll just walk away . walk away and leave you here .

you closed it , did n't you , grace ?

it 's not locked . i left it open when i took out jake 's body .

i 'll get it .

but you said we could be together .

he can kill us . i do n't know about you , but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars .

yeah . good thinking .

to get my car .

get it , and put the money in it . pack up anything else you want to take with you .

if it is n't here , why would he wear that stupid key ?

you could have hit him , or kneed him in the balls .

what about us ?

i do n't think we have anything to talk about .

i thought you would be on your way to vegas by now . is there something you wanted ?

jesus christ ! listen to yourself ! i ca n't do it , grace . i ca n't do it .

if the key 's on him , to get the key we 'd have to . . .

it 's not a combination lock . it takes a key . he keeps it on him all the time . i mean all the time . it scratches up against me when we do it .

jake .

i 'm just flesh and blood , baby . that and a few memories of bad women ; just like most guys . but you already know that . you read my fortune . thanks for the lemonade .

maybe i like to find out about a man first . maybe i like to know what he 's made of .

a little of this , a little of that . mostly i tell fortunes .

yes , i have .

you should be more careful .

my cup runneth over , beauti --

that 's right on my way .

not from where i stand .

nothing happened with me and grace this morning .

i came for grace .

that 's what i like about you , jake . you 're an honest man .

all i have in the world .

is the job done ?

if you 're going to gamble , might as well play for high stakes .

i just drove in this morning .

you 're welcome , grace .

no , i 've got it .

that 's right on my way .

there was a young fellow over at jamilla 's today when it got hit . way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers .

what 'd you say to me !

i do n't care , just get me there .

goddamnit virgil , stop ! do n't !

yeah , i heard a key slapping against my ass .

what 's the matter ?

you never said anything . about the drapes .

who was that on the phone ?

i said come on !

yes .

ask if he can check how many sick days i 've taken since i 've worked here ?

i had to put him down .

i do n't know megan .

it 's finished . i won .

think carefully ?

we 're supposed to be honest .

as a color , not as rust . you know , a rust colored paint or wood ?

jesus .

megan ?

no that 's it .

okay .

stop messing with my life elijah . my son almost shot me last night . he wanted to prove you were right .

one last question .

listen . i got to be on the sidelines during the game ... you can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at --

is there a problem ?

what 's he talking about ?

what 's he look like ?

do n't be scared .

how much can you lift ?

just play one set of downs . i told them you were great .

you represent someone in philadelphia ?

but i 'm afraid of water , so that 's been holding my career back a little bit .

was your family traveling with you ?

where were you sitting on the train ?

any way , fate stepped in and took football out of the equation .

on a bench , across the street .

... i got a present for you .

innocent of what ?

i fined 'em instead .

billiards , eh ? even though i do n't really wish to play ?

what 'd he say ?

well , ned , you 'll want to tell me an ' mister beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours , i guess . bring him in , boys , for i will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches .

did n't give us nothin ' but his own name ... ned roundtree .

... would n't let you settle it , huh ?

advances ?

scouting ?

you leave me at the mercy of my enemies .

be careful with those , sonny .

books . he 's my biographer .

well , i was always tasting the soup two hours after i et it .

you know how women kin lie ... i knock 'em around a little , ask 'em where the money is , they say they do n't have none ? ... but they coulda squirreled away that much , the five of 'em . maybe .

i did n't hear nothin ' till last night .

porch . i 'm puttin ' a porch on her so 's i can puff my pipe of an evening an ' drink my coffee an ' watch the sun set .

hell no . leastways , they wo n't pay to do it .

`` deserve '' do n't mean shit , little bill .

well , uh ... it ai n't loaded .

there ai n't no snakes in here , mister hendershot .

i ... dunno . i mean , i guess not . no , they ai n't carryin ' no guns .

them friends of yours in the back , they carryin ' pistols ?

maybe you should ... hang the carpenter .

`` well , jim , '' i says , `` it makes me sick to see a man struttin ' around and packin ' two pistols an ' a henry rifle and cryin ' like a baby . ''

but ... if he does n't miss ?

he will be hurryin ' and he will miss . that there is as fast as i can pull an ' aim an ' hit anythin ' more ' n ten feet away ... unless it 's a barn .

l-lies ... at first . about how you was just passin ' through and did n't kill nobody ... an ' little bill kept askin ' questions , mixin ' him up , catchin ' lies ... an ' then he 'd beat on ned an ' ned would cry and lie some more an ' then ... then ...

about where you an ' him was ... an ' where you was from ... an ' what your names was ... an ' ...

no he ai n't . he went south yesterday .

silky an ' faith , they rode off to the east an ' two deputies was followin ' them .

are you ... are you gon na ... kill little bill ?

i trust you , bill .

it 's a hell of a thing , ai n't it , killin ' a man . you take everythin ' he 's got ... an ' everythin ' he 's ever gon na have ...

that was ... the first one .

you ... you ai n't gon na shoot him yourownself ?

yup .

he 's in there .

well , he 's holding on to his shit like it was money .

yeah , he 's in there .

did you kill him ?

well ... i do n't recollect .

easy , kid , easy . now , you hear that , ned ? the kid can see fifty yards fine , hear ?

now hold on , boys , hold on . now , kid , you kin see fifty yards , ca n't you ?

for cuttin ' up a lady . they cut up her face an ' cut her eyes out , cut her ears off an ' her tits too .

who was next ? clyde ? or was it ... ?

you sure you ai n't armed ?

i seen her ... i seen claudia too ...

i remember how there was three of them deputies you shot ... not two .

what he was talkin ' about ... how them deputies had the drop on you an ' pete ...

not for me . i do n't touch it no more .

i brung this for when we had to kill them fellows . i guess we could use some now .

now ned 's a hell of a shot with a rifle . hell , he can hit a bird in the eye flyin ' .

why would the kid shoot at us ?

he ai n't shootin ' our way no more . he 's shootin ' over that way . who 's he shootin ' at over that way ?

naw . naw , i do n't ever go into town for that . a man like me ... a man like me ca n't get no woman but one he 's gon na pay for ... an ' that ai n't right ... buyin ' flesh . claudia , god rest her soul , she would n't have wanted me doin ' nothin ' like that , me bein ' a father , an ' all .

naw , son , i did n't kill nobody .

n-nobody ... only you took your shotgun an ' that pistol an ' ...

yeah ?

we 'll bury him .

well i guess bill munny was n't no fearless killer an ' bank robber like he said .

three days ? we could kill 'em tomorrow .

he 's blind , for chri ...

see that scrub oak yonder ?

thought you was followin ' me .

i do n't get it .

& lt ; & lt ; it was smaller than that . sharper. & gt ; & gt ;

& lt ; & lt ; we were there to buy a man and take him back to hungary. & gt ; & gt ;

they ruined me tonight .

i'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by monday .

just forget about it .

i had a guy 's fingers in my asshole tonight .

so why the hell was i hauled in and cavity searched tonight ?

this whole thing was a shakedown .

i 'd say you 've gotten on his main and central nerve , mcmanus .

i know you . you do n't think i know you 're on the take . this whole fucking precinct is dirty . you do n't have a fucking leg to stand on .

forget it . i'11 probably shit blood tonight .

never heard of him .

what time is it ?

listen to me , cocksucker . there is no keyser sate . if you say his name again , i'11 kill you right here .

i hear you did time with old spook . yeah , he was a good egg . i used to run a lot of dope for him . fuckin ' shame he got shivved .

what ?

waste of time .

two hours , tops .

what'the fuck is that ?

did they charge him with anything ?

and i am sure you have a host of wild + theories to answer these questions .

you think he's.. ?

i knew him . he would never -

this is all bullshit .

why did he want you to live ? a one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple ? no , sir . why '

but how - wait . you 're saying soze sent t us to kill someone ?

there were no drugs on that boat . it was a hit . a suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger keyser soze so sate had a few thieves put to it . men he knew he could march into certain death .

yes you do . you know what i 'm getting at . the truth . try to tell me you did n't know . try to tell me you saw someone kill keaton .

this is totally irrelevant .

i came clean . i told it like it happened on the boat . so what if i left out how i got there ? it 's got so many holes in it , the d.a . would 've told me to blow amnesty out my ass . so you got what you wanted out of me . big fucking deal .

i do n't think you do . but you say you saw keaton die . i think you 're covering his ass and he 's still out there somewhere . i think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor . my bet is he 's using you because you 're stupid and you think he 's your friend . you tell me he 's dead , so be it . i want to make sure he 's dead before i go back to new york .

heartwarming . really , i feel weepy .

the first thing i learned on the job , know what it was ? how to spot a murderer . let 's say you arrest three guys for the same killing . put them all in jail overnight . the next morning , whoever is sleeping is your man . if you 're guilty , you know you 're caught , you get some rest - let your guard down , you follow ?

i know he was good .

i know you liked keaton i know you think he was a good man .

counselor , you 're bluffing . shall i push for misdemeanor two ?

i 'm fine .

yes . it would be .

what does it mean ?

it looks that way .

... that was a dr. david gruber 's office ...

you reached down into death . now , is n't that right ?

... we did everything we could ...

why was n't she getting oxygen ... ?

yes .

we 've touched on this , his own witness has said ...

how old are you ?

i know of him .

do you know dr. robert towler ... ?

are you board-certified in anesthesiology , doctor ?

that is correct . i was engaged to render an opinion .

after , after the operation , when that poor girl , she went in a coma . dr. towler called me in . he told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired , and he never looked at the admittance form . and he told me to change the form . he told me to change the one to a nine . or else , or else , he said ... he said he 'd fire me . he said i 'd never work again ... .who were these men ... ? who were these men ... ? i wanted to be a nurse ...

yes .

just now ...

you ruined my life , mister ... me and my wife ... and i am going to ruin yours ... you do n't have to go out there to see that girl . we been going four years . four years ... my wife 's been crying herself to sleep what they , what , what they did to her sister .

please sit down . i told your wife . i 'm sorry that we have to meet out here . i 've got a case coming in two days in the superior court and my office is a mess of papers .

that 's what i 'd planned to ...

it was good of you to meet ...

negligent . yes ... it would have been criminal . but that was not the case .

'practice and methodology in anaesthesia . ' general textbook on the subject . is that correct ?

i read the file . yeah . marx and towler . i know who they were .

uh ... in the , well , in the interests of her family ... you , dr. gruber , you know , you can never tell what a jury is going to do . st. catherine 's a very well thought of institution . her doctors ...

i do . who is it ? the doctors . what do you owe them ?

who says that i 'm protecting anyone ?

and ask me what ?

... you got your doctor 's testimony . why do you need me ?

that happens .

i need an extension for my case .

i do n't have a goddamned idea .

do you want me to go ... ?

and are they going to get it ?

really . how wonderful for you .

my ex-husband was a lawyer .

he 's not in , sir .

what did she do ?

read me what she said .

okay . what do you do when you do n't have a witness ?

how are you holding up ?

yeah ? how 's our new witness ?

d'you meet with dr. gruber ... ?

i 've got my dr. gruber , says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway , plus she came in complaining of stomach pains ...

what ?

mick . mick . mick ...

... i 'm going to need your help ...

... i get these people to trust you -- they 're coming here tomorrow by the way -- i get this expert doctor to talk to you . i 'm doing all your fuckin ' legwork -- and it 's eighteen months . you 're 'sposed to be in court . i bet you have n't even seen the file .

yes . yes , i have .

... i know . i went ...

she did ?

a single hour .

yes ...

kathy price ...

hi . how are you doing ?

yes .

that frank was working on . yeah . he thought franky needed some help , so they bribed a juror . so franky finds out . he comes to me in tears . he thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker ' is got to be a saint . i told him ' franky , wake up . these people are sharks . what do you think they got so rich from ? doing good ? ' he ca n't be comforted . he tells the boys at stearns and harrington they 've disappointed him , he 's going to the judge to rat them out .

why did she never tell her daughter ?

great-grandmother . the child who was taken from her whose loss drove carlotta mad and to her death - was madeleine 's grandmother .

there are things you did n't tell me .

i can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you . they 're dependable , good boys --

no .

how long have you been back ?

no . but one assumes obligations . my wife 's family is all gone ; someone has to look after her interest . her father 's partner runs the company yard in the east -- baltimore -- so i decided as long as i had to work at it , i 'd come back here . i 've always liked it here .

what happened ?

love me ... keep me safe ...

no ! let me go !

go up the stairs , judy . i 'll follow .

where are you going ?

judy , you 've got to do this for me ! please !

they 're none of them right .

but i loved the second one she wore . and this one -- -- is beautiful .

yes .

as friends ? we 'd just see a lot of each other as friends , and you 'd `` take care of me '' ?

thank you again . good-night .

because i remind you of her ?

well , i feel i owe you something for all this ...

will you have dinner with me ?

i told you ! my name is judy barton ! i come from salina kansas . i work at magnin 's ! i live here ! my gosh , do i have to prove it ?

listen , what is this ? what do you want ?

salina , kansas !

it 's a place to live , that 's all .

i warn you , i can yell awfully loud .

i 'm not going to hurt you ! i promise ! please !

no , i happened to see you come in , and i thought --

no , never ! i 've never been there ! scottie , what is it ? i 've never been there !

at the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --

i 'm not mad . i 'm not mad . and i do n't want to die , but there 's someone inside me , there 's a somebody else , and she says i must die ... scottie , do n't let me go !

but i 'm the woman in the mirror !

no . it 's new and clean , and waiting .

tell me what it is . where do you go ? what takes you away ?

only silence . it 's always like this .

well ... anywhere in particular ?

good-bye .

oh , yes . fine . no after effects . but as i remember now , that water was cold , was n't it ? what a terrible thing to do ... and you were so kind ... it 's a formal thank-you letter . and a great big apology .

i wanted to drive you home . are you all right ?

what ?

that 's a good occupation . and live here ... alone ?

that 's a good , strong name . do your friends call you john ? or jack .

you should n't have brought me here , you know .

lucky for me you were wandering about . thank you again . i 've been terrible bother to you .

why ?

no ... she only comes to sit . two or three times a week . and i never ask questions , you know . as long as they 're well behaved . i must say that i 've wondered --

i ca n't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --

well , it 's a living . but i 'm excited about this .

wandering .

all i said in the note was : `` where are you ? '' that does n't sound desperate to me .

mmm , yeah , i guess ...

no , not carlotta . elster 's wife .

you have n't told me everything .

yeah .

not that kind of history . the small stuff ! about people you never heard of !

i 've got a theory . look . if i can get used to heights just a little at a time ... progressively see ?

i asked my doctor . he said only another emotional shock could do it , and probably would n't . and you 're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out .

could be .

you know there 's only one man in the world for me , johnny-o .

oh !

mmm . why do n't you go away for a while ?

well ? ... what 'll you do ?

i know . everybody tells me .

midge , do you suppose many men wear corsets ?

ow ! !

by her own hand . there are many such stories .

yes , it is . now , i want to look at an evening dress , a dinner dress , black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this ... ... and the skirt out .

i said how 's it going ?

you have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies . you have always been a fringe player . you have some serious male on male intimacy problems .

you never were a team player . that 's why you never had any friends .

do n't point at me .

what did you say ?

the floor was wet . she slipped !

playing ?

we were playing ... she slipped ... she hit her head .

you 're interrupting a personal conversation .

they wo n't figure it out .

it has worked .

i wo n't calm down . i ca n't do this . we ca n't do this . it wo n't work . it will not work .

what is your problem ?

any time fat boy !

we have to get going .

open the suitcases , unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs .

according to jewish law , the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being . they must be buried together or their souls wo n't rest in peace .

what ?

what about the blood ?

wrap her up in blankets . bring the car around to the back of the hotel , throw her off the balcony , put her in the car ... done .

are you sure this was an accident ?

we have to call the ambulance .

why ? why ? she 's dead . why are you calling an ambulance ?

what do you think you are doing ?

you want to hear me out ?

i 'm not getting a ticket .

no way .

tomorrow . we are getting married tomorrow .

what does that mean ?

doing the bachelor party thing ?

where is she ?

ah , yeah , hi . is tina there ?

here 's his head .

i got her arm .

he 's right .

fine . do n't come crying to boyd . no sir .

i 'm serious . i 'm the serious one here . i 'm the one making the play . i 'm the indian runner . and i want my money .

you care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation ?

my what ?

this is a situation that defies judgement . we have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most .

that 's right .

jesus boyd you 're going to o.d . him .

you want to know what you are doing here ? ! you are love pumping . you are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies . you are walking the walk . this is it fisher , the real stuff . you love this woman . love is second to nothing . i love you . i love moore . i love micheal . this car is full of love , and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love , man . nothing . we will do what it takes . whatever it takes .

i said , what have we done ?

you always were a jealous man .

micheal , now is probably not the best time for this .

prison communication systems . an acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in denver that i just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large , exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in colorado . yes sir .

tony ? this is keith fisher . you 're doing my wedding and i 'm calling about the chair situation . yeah , i 'll hold .

how about my fatburger ?

franco harris has a flare for the dramatic . the former pittsburgh steeler running back , beat known for `` the immaculate reception , '' his improbable sixty yard ricochet reception . i say ricochet reception has made a bold move on corporate america . harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the park sausage company . by taking on the challenge of resurrecting park 's , harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime .

you will not screw this up .

you said nobody would miss her .

now if i 'm the king of israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it 's just a matter of time ... right ? am i right ?

they have a president . a benjamin yahoo something .

israel does n't have a king .

moore ?

the hell i did !

move the bodies ?

like how ?

you left a dead prostitute out in the desert ? alone ?

what ?

that means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids .

i know .

well , can you come back inside ?

okay .

no . just like an hour or so .

how late ?

we 're on our way home . i just ... we 're running a little late .

go have fun . not too much .

well i do .

will you please call the chair people ?

more than i ever imagined being able to love anyone ever .

go down to the seat place and straighten this out .

do you love me ?

you expect more what ?

he 's a great chef .

he 's quiet .

i suppose boyd is the creative force behind all this .

well it 's bad timing .

are we going to do this again ?

you ca n't play around with these tent people .

this is ridiculous .

ok , ok. you guys just go back in . dad , keep going with the toast , we 'll be right in . go on .

well , i 'm in the middle of my goddamn toast here .

i 'm just so scared of that song . that fucking , `` my son just arrived the other day ... he says thanks for the ball , come on let 's play . i got lots of bills come again next day . he 's grown up just like me ... my boy is just like me . '' gordon fucking lightfoot , cat stevens , whoever , that song just fucking kills me .

i wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you . you know , just to be with you , father and son , before you run off and do your own husband , daddy thing . i 'm just so goddamn proud of you ... god knows i did n't always play it right with you ...

well if you do think about names ... micheal 's a pretty good one ... it 's done me all right .

no . no . no . this is my doing . you see i 'm gon na have my wahoo spark for my own . for lois and the kids , for my brother , for franco . i 'm gon na turn myself in . i am all that . i 'm gon na do it for sweet lois .

that 's my point ! you see man ... burning at his absolute . to see all the forces just come together , just right , you know , just in perfect harmony . that 's what i 'm driving at . you get me ?

just go ahead and say what 's on your mind .

dear god ... i do n't know how to pray .

just insecurity . nut crunching gut splinters .

i do n't know . she 's really been stressing out .

i think you 'd make an excellent big brother .

that 's a good one .

yeah ?

boyd ... i do n't know man ... it just seems to me that ever since you took tony robbins self-help thing ... you 're all fucked-up in the head .

how do you know she 's dead .

what song ?

i kind of like `` till death do us part . '' i mean , this is forever . in sickness and in health , through good times and bad . honey , what do you think ?

we do n't say `` love , honor and obey '' anymore . and we do n't say `` till death do us part . '' today we say , `` respect , honor and cherish , as long as you both do love . '' how does that sound ?

that 's our plan .

take your time . i wish i had .

i said out of respect . respect for you fisher . for you and your wedding and your beautiful bride . there will be no more rain . you see where i am here ?

i do n't think that 's a good idea .

fish , i 'm really sorry . i just ... i owe you man . desert .

fucking desert .

yes , yes .

i 'll come to you tonight .

no , it 's true . last night when you were sleeping , i had you all to myself .

do n't go !

yes , i do n't want you ever to leave this house .

today i can refuse you nothing .

no , uncle ; ashes mean penance and death .

you must think i am a monster .

evil .

no . mother superior told me to come .

you 'll think you 're still at the convent .

tell her i lied , that i did n't take advantage of her .

why do n't you speak to her , ramona ? women are good at that sort of thing . think of something that will make her stay a few more days . you are kind , ramona ! speak to her . i know i do n't need to offer you anything , but , if you 're successful in this , i 'll not forget you or your little girl .

good .

come on , miss . just so the virgin can be really pretty .

that 's life . some people are brought together , others are separated . what can we do , if that 's the way it happens ?

what i do every day , but i want to do it earlier .

where 's the dough ?

i do n't want you to untie me . kill him and then i 'll give you the money .

why ?

do you intend to stay here for some time ?

is that all you 're going to devote your life to ?

i do n't understand how you can like being alone so much .

and do you know that my mother and i had to suffer ? if my father had bothered himself a little more about us , i 'd be an architect now .

well ... is it so urgent ?

what 's he called ?

how are you today ?

where ?

yes -- very , very big !

i 'm afraid .

yes !

they shut all right now . and the blankets are ready .

i 'll talk the way i want to . i 've had enough of this .

when you are , miss .

that 's enough . go join the others , and do n't come back here . and you 'll have to control your temper .

do n't pay any attention to him . it 's very good .

she looks like a sick marrow !

you son-ofabitch , i 'm going to kill you .

i do n't know .

i 've seen worse .

why'd.. .you pull me out ?

give me 30 seconds , then flip every switch you can reach .

why did n't anybody tell me ? !

i need your help --

this is a full pardon . it authorizes your immediate release .

only because i got pulled out early .

you 're ... such a wimp .

i told you this would work.. by setting back the clocks , he has absolutely no idea he 's in virtual reality . he still thinks he 's in the real world .

do n't worry . through me , you will live forever ...

i think i understand what you have in mind ...

i had something a little different in mind . instead of just playing peeping tom with reilly , why do n't you get him to show you what he 's been working on after hours ?

i do n't know .

sid ?

you 've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon . you stopped sid 6.7 and you 've got his module . you 're free to go right now . why are you going to do this ?

sid 6.7 is n't grimes .

he did n't know about the neural toxin . i did .

which way ?

what did you do to those people ?

what does that mean ?

i told you , it was on the way and i wanted to change clothes .

thank-you . her name is karin .

she 's beautiful , you know ?

but rather than selecting pieces from each individual , he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones .

he 's part of the mix . sid 6.7 is a composite .

maybe after they catch him , you should write a book about him ...

do me one favor if you shoot at anything , make sure i 'm nowhere near it .

every day for the last five years , i told myself someday i would be out here again . no more bars . no more guards . no more fights just to stay alive . every day for the last five years , i told myself that lie .

it was just like before , was n't it ? was n't it ? but you are making progress . instead of killing seven people to get the one you 're after , this time there was only one other person involved .

in other words , par for the course . how do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday ?

there you go best seat in the house .

it 's really too bad you have to miss the grand finale .

where did you plant the c-4 ? !

why 's that ?

the symphony of collision ...

< u > lure < /u > him .

... tonight ...

naw , we ca n't play this one catch-up . that 's how long since you stopped beating the wife . we have to ...

but how do we explain the fact he was in prison ?

< u > fuck < /u > the world . try a ten a.m. < u > pitch < /u > meeting , no sleep , coked-to-the-gills , and you have n't even read the < u > material < /u > .

... his triumphal plane . shot down .

come on .

you know , i think you people are looking at this all wrong . if you look at the < u > backstory < /u > -- the guy 's coming back from combat and torture . of < u > course < /u > he is gon na be ... uh ... uh ... `` fucked up '' . of < u > course < /u > he 's gon na `` need a little help '' ...

well , get on the phone , and < u > get < /u > it ...

all we have to do now is sell it to the president .

... this is a snappy song ... .

that 's not bad at all .

how 's your wife ?

war 's over , pal .

oh , lord ... .

yep . well , we started it , he ended it ...

... brazen-it-through ...

you missed your < u > plane < /u > ? my < u > life < /u > is over . my < u > life < /u > is over . what have you < u > done < /u > to me ? what have i done ? fourteen years of public service ...

none of these are ours . < u > none < /u > of em are ours ... . ... .that 's < u > real politik < /u > , buddy .

y' wan na follow the cattle drive ? sleep in the winter . what does < u > moss < /u > want ... ? matchmaker comes to the levinsky family . mr. levinsky , mrs. levinsky , would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son saul , from princess margaret of great britain . well , they think , she is n't jewish , but she 's well to-do , a nice old family . alright , yes , they say . we would consider such an offer . wonderful , matchmaker says , my job is half done . now , look : i got the < u > file < /u > , from the l.a. contingent , i got the day-by-day , of how ...

you 're tired , ronnie .

catching up on his reading . asked about you , sends his thanks .

... but to the old world ; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of war which have , since i was a child ...

stanley moss , ladeesngennlmen ... and she says ...

new york times , wash post , detroit register , san diego bee , all in emission . < u > no < /u > mention of the girlscout . none .

do n't you want to know if it 's true ?

and i think that the security of the country would be best-served by its citizens obeying its laws . gemme a federal judge , gemme search-warrants , all premises controlled by our friends , and bench-warrants for the two of ...

guess what ? we show , and n.s.a . confirms , there < u > are < /u > no nuclear devices on the canadian border . there are no nuclear devices in albania . z'at put us in something of a pickle ? albania < u > has < /u > no nuclear capacity . our spy satellites show `` no secret terrorist camps '' in the albanian hinterland . the f.b.i . and the border patrol , and the r.c.m.p . report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque canadian border . the albanian government is screaming its innocence , the world is listening . there is no war .

quite touching .

i know who you are , mr. ames .

and i can only say , to those family members , < u > of < /u > group 303 , which members are , i know , as i speak , gathering to comfort you , the parents of the missing man , i can only say ,

it 's like being a producer , mr. moss . the things in trouble . somebody 's got to wade in , save the thing . you get the actors get up there , and strut and < u > posture < /u > . but somebody , knows what 's what , got to jump in and save the thing .

what one has to do , mr. moss . is to fight a holding action .

hi ... can i buy you a drink ? i 'm celebrating tonight .

mr. lynch , i swear to you , he 's lying !

the stock 's going to pluto !

hey you hear the news . i just got a job at a new firm : `` dewey , cheat 'em and howe . '' yuk yuk .

forget charts ! we 're not fund managers , bud , churn 'em and burn 'em . i 'm offering you the knicks and chicks . god save you before you turn into poor steeples over there .

just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is . you forgetting something ?

your words , not mine ...

he 's got your prick in his back pocket , son , and you 're standing naked in the display window of macy 's . he 's using you . only you 're too blind to see it .

problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you 're never happy 'cause somebody 's always trying to take it away from you . money 's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me ... thanks .

hey to bluestar , as your broker all i can advise is hold on to that stock dad ...

it 's yourself you 've got to be proud of , huckleberry , how much ya need ?

coulda been a contender .

ah , i had a tough day . some jerk d.k 'd me and i got ta cover his loss .

first of all , mr. fox , you ca n't just come barging in here . and what makes you think it 's his birthday ?

yes ! read the constitution , it 's all in there . and remember -- you do n't know anything , nothing .

i told him i was in the bathroom and i 'd call him right back . what the hell was i supposed to say buddy , you got me into ...

i got this guy who should know tells me buy hewlitt packard but i been burned on tips . what do you think bud ?

he never told me ...

all right , bud ... let 's do it .

are you with me buddy ?

tell me , gordon -- when does it all end ? how many yachts can you waterski behind ? how much is enough ?

sure . what 's worth doing is worth doing for money . it 's a bad bargain where nobody gains . and if this deal goes through , we all gain .

what makes you think you can ?

... gordon .

money never sleeps pal . when i came in in '69 , they traded six hours a day , now the clock do n't stop , london 's deregulated , the orient is hungrier than us . just let the money circle the world , sport , buying and selling , and if you 're smart it comes back paying . i just made $ 800,000 in hong kong gold . it 's been wired to you -- play with it . you done good , but you got ta keep doing good . i showed you how the game works , now school 's out .

the break up value is higher . it 's worth 80 .

what about it ? you work hard . i 'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought . and where 'd it get you ? ... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies . and he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house ; my mom ended up working in a dish factory ... wake up pal , if you 're not inside you 're outside . and i 'm not talking a $ 200,000 a year working wall street stiff flying first class and being `` comfortable '' , i 'm talking rich pal , rich enough to fly in your own jet , rich enough not to waste time , 50-100 million , a player bud -- or nothing . you had what it takes to let through my door . next question : you got what it takes to stay ... ? ?

i do n't understand .

bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when i left the office . it might spin up to 25 by the bell ...

... a cosmetics company by any chance ? what are you , the 12th man on the deal team ? the last to know ?

i just want to let you know mr. gekko i read all about you at nyu business , and i think you 're an incredible genius and i 've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you ...

so you say . nice to meet you ; hope you 're intelligent . like these , how 'd you get these ?

you really mean that ? what 'd he promise you ? to take you public ? i guess without gordon 's money and seal of approval , i 'm not such a hot investment anymore . you 're just the best money can buy , darien ...

i 'm sorry . i was afraid something like this could happen .

you have modest wants . i like that in a man .

he 's not a racehorse , bud , he 's a jumper .

break it .

you could have a great beach house for that .

it 's not puppy love , gordon . anyway , buddy and i are splitting up .

rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor . interesting . you got a card ?

you got it , g.g .

if you mean what you say , i think we 're in the ball park . i 'll take it to my people .

but he still has something mark has n't .

so why are you dating jonathan ?

businessman !

right . china i need a taking care of , not ` hey how bout a pizza after class babe ' . i 'm looking for something just a little more in a man . a little ` je nes se qua ' .

are you sure you would n't like a closer look ?

and uh , your nicotine sir

no ?

two of your friends left earlier mark uh huh .

that 's not what you said last night .

safety in numbers man .

sell my soul ?

well ?

no thank you sir we 're fine .

mom .

listen to me . the one thing in life that i definitely do n't regret ... is the choice . i made to be your mother .

are you mad at me ?

i think playing in a band called `` bitch '' might put a dent in the whole `` perfect family '' thing .

that he does n't ... see me , or , you know , that i 'm ... that 's something 's wrong ... with me .

you think you influenced her ?

i do n't know . my aunt used to use my uncle 's old pajamas and a candle .

i saw her in the water . beside me . she was filling the bathtub .

she finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio ... she likes rock and roll . angry rock and roll .

mm-hmm .

do you really think so ?

i did n't want to come .

mine . his . we both ... thought ...

i 'm sorry that i frightened you like that . but i was so touched by your concern . i 've been lonely here . perhaps we could be friends .

um ... sure .

your house is so beautiful .

and then you were n't there .

wait ! do n't go ...

this fence ... it 's so ...

tell me . please .

who ? your husband ?

um ... yes .

no , i do n't .

and there 's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in finnish .

i did n't sleep with him .

anyway , claire slept with him ...

i do n't know ...

i guess not .

but he acted like he 'd never heard of it .

jody , she tried to kill him .

what are you going to do ?

how could i expect you to tell me something that i would n't even tell myself ?

i 'm a terrible friend .

too late ? jody , it was an accident .

i started to walk over ... but he was n't alone . a blond . i only caught a glimpse . she was young . i should have said something right away . but i did n't .

artsy little village down seven . there 's a guy there who sells my work . i had just dropped off some paintings and as i got in my car ... i saw norman sitting at this little cafe .

this .

sit down here .

someone 's there .

seance .

so you 'll have some later . notice anything ... different ?

it 's true . that 's ... you have to believe me ! oh god , i 'm telling you the truth ! i did what i had to , claire . she was gone . there was nothing i could do for her . i did ... i put her in the lake . i rolled the car in ... and i watched it sink . and i 've lived with that image ever since . i could n't just stand there while everything -- my career , us , everything , just washed away . do n't you see , claire ? she 's doing this ! this is exactly what she wants you to think !

i did not ! i did not kill anyone . jesus . claire , listen to me . i walked in and she was lying there dead . i swear to you . on my life ! she took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me ! to destroy us ! if i had n't stopped by here before school , the painters would have --

fine . i 'll do the shopping .

it 's alright .

... would do anything just to be around me . and i slipped . god help me , i slipped .

who ?

that 's not what i 'm sayi --

stop it !

it 's her . this is the woman who i 've seen .

what 's wrong with me ?

a cheap wine glass from the caterers . you started crying . i tried to comfort you ...

you know i am .

how did you --

i do n't need a shrink .

... since caitlin . you do n't remember this ?

our house .

excellent . couple of swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell .

genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms .

norman spencer .

we 'll be quiet . quick and quiet .

: what , you 're doing darcy ? since when ?

i have seen him again . last night .

you 've been shadowing the family for thirty years . it 's only fitting you give one af us away .

a spacial entity . an organized energy . something that precedes our definition of existence .

no scaredy-cats in the talamasca , huh ... ?

come . there is a lot to read

i ask only that you stay here , long enough to be - educated . a few hours .

i hope ryan explained that if you stay in this town , you 're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life .

did you like it ... ? looking down at graham and knowing what you could do ... ?

but i had to use my hands . none before you could kill with their mind . graham , my dear . your uncle ... ?

and that is why i pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her ...

stop it !

i 'm tired . i need to rest .

it was quite warranted by the - situation . i realize this is a shock , but really , rowan - you never even knew her . it 's not as if you 've suffered some great -

who the hel1 -

lasher - bring us through !

mum ... oh mum , god will surely strike us -

fast .

ju1ien was your father your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father . all one in the same ... that is why he fought carlotta for your life .

i love michael . michael ! !

i ca n't leave now . do n't ask me to explain ! i just ca n't !

i ca n't .

you 've gone away from me , ro ... someplace i do n't know how to get to .

yyou look terrible . you 're exhausted . you practically live at the goddamn clinic . even pregnant women who are n't doctors know that you ca n't -

remember the first time we made love - and then -- -

no . this is unreal ...

no - i did n't kill him . would you rather i 'd let them kill us - after they 'd raped me ... ?

did you see the old man on the -- -

that 's great !

i do n't think of us that way - ever .

maybe he 's just - waiting ...

michael - this is beatrice mayfair . and this is her brother , giff -- -

but it scares the hell out of you , does n't it . michael ... ?

even if it 's all true - that does n't make you a witch ! it 's 1992 , rowan !

she - she said i - i was a -- -

seems more like a year than a month .

all i meant was -

why do n't you let at do that ... ?

he fools around with his patients too .

mm-hmm . scared- i feel a little like the moth and the flame .

what else did you see- michael ... ?

harder !

i do n't remember you at all- you - you saved my life- bizarre thing to say , is n't it ... ?

the guy i told you about - aaron ... ? he says i can learn to control them . that i could lose the gloves at some point .

you ca n't just -

comes running out the front door - down the walk to them . michael seems to pull inside himself . cool . aloof .

mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that . i mean - hell , they 're all crazy anyway - right ... ?

rowan mayfair .

i plan on liquidating almost evetything .

that 's new territory for us ... but yes , we can look into that . explore shelter possibilities , funding bodies . we could -

standard for a mayfair marriage . rowan - there is a codicil concerning the mayfair assets . they must be ... aahhh ... held separate from the other party ... michael that is it 's in the will - for centuries . tradition enjoins , rowan . of course , future earnings from your practice will not fall into -

we 'd better get to work on the papers .

sounds good - thank you

oh my gawd !

do n't give me shit - what do you want ?

i did n't say that - i 'm sure it could be , but our clients must sign in first , checking signatures , and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we 've been very strict since then .

well , if you could come sometime just before we close , then i could show you everything and then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points ...

why whats wrong with the sugar -

it 's not that - i just do n't want any sugar

ellen , would you like a cup - there 's plenty in the pot

i thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face ...

leslie i 'm sorry - i - i did n't know what to think

out - i may be some time

did you ?

you 've killed but you 're not a killer

i do n't think so ... this is n't a game you know ... there are n't points or leagues . sure i killed my husband - but i am no killer .

tell me about your wife ...

my car i stopped working from my car . she could have stopped me you know - if she really wanted too . that is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - if a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged ? why ?

i think i will pass ...

what are you doing ?

oh - tell me ellen , i can call you ellen ?

you do n't own him you know - you ca n't tell me not to see him !

what 's wrong with you ?

i think he 's fine - i do n't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - i do n't think he would hurt a fly .

sugar ?

yes ... ?

except the girl . the only one that really mattered .

our plane crashed . in the grand canyon . a big fiery explosion . we never made it to l.a. they needed dental records to identify us . and this place . this . actually . is . heaven .

i 'd kiss your mother with this mouth . i mean , if she was n't , you know ...

do n't you know anything about limo etiquette ? everything in here is included for our pleasure .

nobody knows about your constant masturbation .

the only chick more untouchable than christy malone is miss april . `` hi , my name 's ginger . i love tofu burgers , rainy nights , and riding bareback . my biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex . '' here 's a tip : set it on vibrate , honey , and do n't be stingy with the lube . do n't knock it till you tried it .

not bad for a hack . he has a future in yellow journalism .

god , you are so hot .

i was always too shy to admit how much i liked you .

remember dress up day ? you and charlie lifting skirts during recess .

makes your shoulders look so big and broad .

yeah ? you like ?

you really do n't get it , do you ? i am genetically programmed to desire a big , buff , manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring ! it 's , like , a caveman thing !

yeah ?

ladies first . i insist .

i always wanted craftsman tools . he even got me the limited edition buckeye colors .

we 're grateful , ted . it 's not that . those craftsman tools ... they 're a dream come true .

they did do one great thing . they gave us our boy .

it was the year of the rhizopus rot . grandpa almost lost the farm . you sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival . and in the end you saved the peaches and you did n't have to slaughter your sow .

remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out i knew more than you ?

grandpa was so strong back then . working from the crack of dawn . so proud of his peaches .

dad , please .

teddy ? i was thinking .

that 's me .

some of them have to be automatics .

i do n't even know if i should be doing this . it 's a very expensive car .

you do know how to drive ?

my legacy .

you 're on the next plane home .

matter of fact , jay , i 'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown , `` the girls of xenia . '' just to show my appreciation .

how are the hometown folks treating you , back in xenia ?

from my wise , albeit youthful , vantage point , the world is your oyster . you scored big .

you 're a peach .

i miss them , too .

better view , more spacious , new carpet . it 's a no-brainer .

it 's really late ... do your parents know where you are ?

they 're playing our song . dare i ask for this dance ?

let your fingers do the walking .

i know , their small town mentality can be maddening .

maybe someday .

a portuguese boyfriend . sounds very `` cosmo . ''

i 'm very aural .

i 'm trembling with excitement .

that 's probably my office .

it 's incredibly simple .

i mean my father .

i did my homework . your grandfather was a peach farmer .

funny you should say `` peachy . ''

i have to admit , i always felt ... different .

just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world does n't mean you 're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago .

what is it , william randolph ? your balls need scratching ?

i did n't know they gave them for best lip gloss retention during a blow job .

christy 's a very talented journalist . i see a pulitzer in her future .

yeah , i 'm doing fine . i have so much to tell you . i do n't even know where to begin .

what about charlie ? you boys could make it a little adventure .

what ? having spring break ruined by will readings ?

you called the cops on us ?

mr. nelson , you disappoint me . first you break our school board rules . then you break the law .

a new pediatric wing at the hospital ? a presidential campaign ? name it . anything .

thanks , uncle billy . thanks for everything .

seriously ? i 'm doing all right ?

so far , so good . some of them have real angel potential .

at our press conference tomorrow , i think we should announce our plans to explore the world . not just a few leggy 36d 's , with blond hair upstairs and down .

i would have been laughed right out of xenia .

i told you you could do it .

whoa . but ... that 's the thing ... i 've never even actually ...

me ? the king of coitus ?

you are a multi-media magnate . the tycoon of tits . the baron of bottoms .

huh ! you laugh in the face of pressure !

we do n't allow tipn , ted .

as much as possible .

you do like girls , do n't you ?

uh , sure . uncle billy .

oh no . no way . i 've had all the bad news i can take for one day .

i was in the middle of a melodramatic exit . it would n't really make a statement if i tiptoed out the door ... what are you selling ?

kelly van ryan ...

senior class fund-raising gig . i told 'em they could hose down the jeep . hey , come on . it 's for a good cause .

she 's going to wash your jeep ?

not that i 'm going to be much good after last night ...

and the other girl , kelly . suzie 's niece .

suzie . then you 're not her grandmother ...

he was large ?

no . i 've done it a couple of times , i mean with guys i dated . but this hurt ... like , he was built ... you know ...

was there penetration ? did he put himself inside you ?

he said something like , `` do you want it dirty7 '' or something . i tried to turn away , but he pushed me to the floor .

suzie toller is missing .

and when you turned her toward the door , where did you expect her to go , without a car ?

if old pictures interest you , come back some time , there 's quite a collection down in the pagoda . i 'll see you get a proper tour .

it 's homicide 's job now , ray , let 'em do it . i 'll tell you something else , there 's more to this story than you know , ray ... if suzie is dead , i think hunter may be on the right track ...

will you do me one favor ?

the swamp , most likely ... lombardo 's a swamp rat , knows the body will never be found there . but he 's made a mistake .

we all have ...

you could say that .

you got it . the rich got richer . while the saps like lombardo went belly-up in the swamp .

think back , before the suit was filed , before the trial . lombardo had an affair with sandra , right ? so why not tell us about the affair ? i mean it could be a hell of a motive for kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place .

that 's what they called it when i was in juvenile . it 's a pretty dismal place .

no . he stopped by himself . okay ? that 's all . let me go .

that bothers you ?

i do n't care . you heard that girl 's statement . i think he 's dirty . get me a case .

the teeth , were they ...

oh , ray ... no ...

suzie ! did this man rape you ?

yeah ... okay ... he did

what are you looking at ?

are you retarded , or just brain dead from whiffin ' fumes out there in the swamp ...

you are .

man , i wan na smoke a joint .

i 've been a cop for a while , kelly . it 's hard enough for one person to keep a secret , let alone three . and then there 's the love angle . i mean do you and sam really want that little pill-head around , now that you have the money ?

i miss dad .

kelly . what is it ?

whichever one i want .

i 'm running away .

no little girl can ever make me come .

i love you . now give me the line .

god , i 've been calling you .

there was no way . that cop would 've gotten her to tell him ... everything . she was weak and dumb ...

so you got my mom 's money .

kelly ...

mr. lombardo . we 're running kind of late . how about if nicole goes on to the mansons ? you could give me a ride when you find the ticket .

do n't forget the car wash .

just like that ?

ca n't you take that stupid thing off ?

you can tie whoever did it to sandra van ryan ...

i do n't mean who you 're thinking . i have other friends ...

will they ?

meet my partner , gloria perez .

i thought this was supposed to be a vacation . why did n't you buy a nice big power boat ?

sit down , lombardo .

in cutoffs , a wet t-shirt .

trust me , the guy 's dirty . he 'll like it . especially the part about offing me . now get out of here . go make yourself a new friend .

seems to like some of the same places you do . funny you never met .

no , no . look , i probably should have told you a little more , about the part i intended to play . we 'll go through it all again tonight .

so maybe i 'm a one-woman man .

i 'm sure we will .

all right , all right ... it 'll be okay . i mean , eventually it 'll just run out of steam .

we 've got to stop him right here , now ! with that armored steam engine of his it 'll be a slaughter .

what ? president grant is ... !

my pleasure .

what is that ?

oh , damn ! that 's it .

thank you .

that 's right ... that 's good .

hey , i tried the board .

you know your morse code almost as well as i .

starting with a screw ?

is this leading somewhere ?

i 'll work on it .

`` gadget guy ? '' while i may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses , i am , sir , in my own humble way , a man of science .

then why kidnap them ? why not just kill them ?

your train ? listen , friend , you 're obviously lost . ... i 've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime .

i do n't mind him , but who the hell are you ... my valet or something ?

he 's not giving up ?

just a little insurance ... against the unexpected .

well , i owe you one , do n't i ?

really ?

you know , ma'am , you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol i once owned . a beautiful thing to look at , but too hot to handle .

french ?

we find ourselves at the dawn of the golden age of science . and it is the god-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way !

but what would anyone have to gain from all this ... ? unless it were a foreign power .

this is colonel richards .

i 've even printed my own currency .

exactly ! you are on foreign soil . you are a representative of the occupying forces . or have n't you checked a map lately ? !

you got that right . now get up . we 're walking out of here .

no , sir ... just a businessman .

he 's just full of plans that are n't gon na work out .

are you all right ?

you left me to die , friend .

she belongs to all of us . she is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth .

if i 'm not strong enough to be your apprentice , how can i do this ?

earlier today you tried to tell me something , willow .

we 'll probably die here , sorsha .

i do n't believe you .

i do what i 'm told .

let me see it .

as above , so below .

of course ! i promise !

and give her a bath everyday , and do n't let her get cold . and keep her diaper changed .

absolutely !

you be careful . i 'm a powerful sorcerer . i could turn you into a toad just like that .

please ? i 'm dyin ' of thirst in here .

i could be you rguard ! i could carry your spear !

ca n't we keep it , dada ?

how ? ?

no ! change me back into a sor- ceress , willow .

your will ! your will ! what else could it be ?

we do n't have much time left ! go on ! go on !

we got ta follow them .

shut up .

without raziel we 'll never find tir asleen . we 'd better go .

we 've traveled a long way . we 're looking for fin raziel .

did n't you hear me , book ? pull ! you never had your hands on a teat before ?

you do n't know anything ... borrowed your car . did n't say why . and you never heard of that woman and her boy .

oh sure , fred .

eli says you 're a carpenter , book .

what 's that , sam ?

hey , sam ...

move ! or you die right here !

listen to me , johnny . come in ! you 're out there all alone ... we 're getting close ... real close ... maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in

what's-her-name moved to buffalo .

zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight street chemists ... the guys processing this p2p into speed .

amish .

how reliable is this kid ?

land ! are you crazy ? i 'm no amishman and i 'm no farmer ! i 'm a cop . that 's what i know and that 's what i do !

but stoltzfus said ...

vain . proud . such a person is hochmutsnarr . he is not plain .

enjoying your reading ?

listen , thank you . thanks for everything . but i 've got to go .

can i have something to drink ?

believe me , i 'm trying to get this over with as fast as i can . but samuel will probably have to come back and testify .

make that 1790 .

it 's me .

i wanted to . you were kind to take us in last night . anyway , i needed something to do . i was so angry with your brother . he 's so ... agaanisish !

you did n't have to ...

you are acting like one !

no sin ? maybe . not yet . but , rachel , it does not look ... do n't you know there has been talk ? talk about you , not him . talk about going to the bishop . about having you ... shunned !

eh ? well then , maybe he can go to zook 's barn-raising , eh ? see how good a carpenter .

my son is out there !

i know . sleep now , liebchen .

you wicked old witch ! uncle henry , auntie em , do n't let 'em take toto ! do n't let her take him -- please !

poor little orphan , and her miss gulch troubles . gosh all hemlock - you know , she ought to have somebody to play with .

from now on you 'll be history

well , i -- i -- i am the great and powerful -- wizard of oz .

oh ... .

the wizard - the wizard - the great and powerful wizard of oz - oz - oz-oz - oz - oz - oz - oz !

i do n't believe you !

no , i 'm afraid i did n't .

oh , very good , but very mysterious . he lives in the emerald city , and that 's a long journey from here . did you bring your broomstick with you ?

that was her sister -- the wicked witch of the east . this is the wicked witch of the west . and she 's worse than the other one was .

are you a good witch , or a bad witch ?

oh --

that 's all -- the crystal 's gone dark .

uh-huh .

how did you guess ?

dorothy !

and bears !

oh-oh-

oh , see - i killed it . oh , i killed that poor little honey bee !

no -- it feels wonderful . i 've held that axe up for ages . oh -- -

huh ? what 'd he say ?

but why ? why ?

who 's her ? who 's her ?

what 's the matter -- gon na let a little old pig make a coward out of you ?

no -- no -- no -- no !

oh -- are you -- are you all right ?

of course , i do n't know , but i think it 'll get darker before it gets lighter .

i do n't see how . you were n't around when i was stuffed and sewn together , were you ?

but you 've just been saying how much you want a heart .

oh --

to oz !

my , it 's good to be ... .

whhhooops ! ha-ha -- there goes some of me again !

ohh !

down ? no , you see , i 'm -- well , -- i 'm --

the slippers -- yes ... ..the slippers !

yeah !

do -- do you think it 'll be polite -- dropping in like this ?

up !

yes , you .

yeah . me ?

i 've got a plan how to get in there .

what was that ?

wait a minute . this is the left one . he walks bad enough already .

imposserous !

whew ! that was n't my plan - but something happened , did n't it ?

oh --

it 's no use screaming at a time like this ! nobody will hear you ! help !

animals that -- that eat straw ?

i 'm not afraid of her . i 'll see you get safely to the wizard now , whether i get a brain or not ! stuff a mattress with me ! hah !

it 's empty . the tinsmith forgot to give me a heart .

as for you , my galvanized friend , you want a heart ! you do n't know how lucky you are not to have one . hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable . i could have been a world figure , a power among men , a - a successful wizard , had i not been obstructed by a heart .

do you know what youre doing ?

we go down to the torpedo bay .

the king pipeline .

what is it ?

makes her look even more innocent .

whos she ?

they wont get far . every warhead has a locator card . a miratom device . emits a high-pitched signal on russian emergency frequencies . we can track the bomb .

so who are you ?

couldnt make it . splitting headache .

dont know any doctor jokes .

james . it wouldnt really be ...

the worm on the hook again .

get out to the pipeline . find the insider who switched the pin . if your instincts are right , renard will be back . he hasnt completed the job . the pipeline is still going forward , and we have elektra to thank for that .

sir robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own ... resources , at first . when elektras ear was delivered to him in the post , he came to me . i advised against paying the ransom . i knew it was renard . i played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him .

007. what do you know of the caspian sea ?

who buys classified reports for three million pounds .

old friend ?

and we know how difficult that can be for the swiss .

not the usual swiss procedure , mr. bond , but you understand , a man in my position..

he died before he could complete his lifelong dream . i intend to finish it for him .

elektra , its not too late . eight million people neednt die .

he killed me ! he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom .

how did you survive ?

i dont want to be safe !

i know .

oh my god ... were buried alive ...

i have to check the upper lines . gabor will drive you back .

are you trying to break my heart ? or is it just your way with women ?

mafia warlords , diplomats and spies , consortiums from every country in the world . a nice little rats nest .

bond !

who ? bond ? bond is dead .

why are you like this ? because bond is dead ? its what you wanted .

its heading for the oil terminal .

marvellous .

what ? !

thirty minutes maximum . of course , i assume we 'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order .

well , sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we 'd assume that twenty-five percent of the russian birds get through .

had a lot of blood in him .

do n't call me that .

veidts complex .

i do n't know yet . i should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years .

because --

we 'd better hope so . -- it 's almost time .

your problem , dan , is a lack of vision . you spent all those years chasing after muggers , and drug dealers , and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it . as if any of it mattered .

then ive been a very bad boy and youll have to spank me . christ ! im doing what i have to do to save the godforsaken human race ! !

who ?

i beg your pardon . . . ? some gratitude .

that 's because --

the costumes . am i right ?

what ?

not at all . you look very -- dashing . here , you pick one .

oh . no . sorry . i 'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . i mean , if you need some aspirin , or --

do n't know . nothing i can think of -- -- outside of a nuclear blast .

what caused it ?

okay , let 's just . . . thank you .

sorry , daniel . you 've always been a good friend . i know that . sorry about laurie .

cases , leads -- they do n't matter , rorschach . the world 's about to end . if someone is trying to kill us , it does n't matter .

veidt 's a fool . tried to warn him about new information . sicced his mangy cat on me .

i do n't know if you heard . a hired gunman tried to off adrian .

hiya , pardner . long time no see .

janey , will you marry me ?

i 'll say . if we ever get off this looney-tune project , i 'm gon na head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak .

oh sweetheart , just a quick one .

what about you ?

i know . i should n't be saying this . he 's happy , he 's content , he 's doing his work --

and how 's life with the walking h-bomb ?

laurie ! good to see you .

i 'm on the way with a team to relieve you . what 's the latest ?

you 're a grungy little phoenix , you know that ? keep up the good work .

i know , poison needles in my shins . you 've got 36 hours . peace , out .

if you 're trying to push my buttons , you 're on the right track . do n't make me question my own judgment , x .

yeah , i spy or i die .

i 'm not interested . i 've already got a job .

good thing you were there to save the day . come walk with me .

you know what i hate ? it 's always the assholes that pass the tests .

you wan na find out about rats , ask a rat . i 've had my people put together a talent pool . i downloaded it to your desktop .

how will you fix it ?

you saving me ? you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling .

what weapons do you have ?

kirill , the sniper . looks like a bookworm , but he had 72 confirmed kills in chechnya , they called him the `` finger of god '' . assassination and weapons .

you ca n't welch on me now . we had a deal .

go to the water , it 's that way !

where 'd the damn truck go ? !

are n't they gon na wonder were you 've been ?

i must be healthy , then , because i 'm scared to death . i guess i 'd better get back to yorgi .

get your head back in the game . there are lives at stake here .

no , i guess i 've been no help at all to you .

that 's alright , i 'll figure something out .

a beach named x ? that i 'd like to see .

all i have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts .

the people i know want facts , the kinds of things an insider would know . they 're interested in putting anarchy 99 out of business .

whoever sent you knew what they were doing . you and yorgi are practically twins . two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but do n't say much .

that 's how you eat ? it 's like a gerbil .

the eyes do n't lie . all this has gotten to you , has n't it , petra ? you came in as yorgi 's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun . now you do n't like it so much , but you 're in so deep you ca n't get out anymore . tell me if i 'm wrong , petra .

that right ? why 's that ?

if you got a problem with me , why are we dancing ?

i have japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet , if you have the quality of merchandise they 're after . and it 's a mil two , max .

it 's a stakeout suit . it 's got food , water , recording gear , anything you need for covert spying . it 's all- weather , fire retardant , and if you give this buckle a sharp pull , the whole outfit deploys into a parachute .

this is so typical . i ca n't believe you . i 've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this ? are you out of your mind ?

you 're serious ?

why you dogging me up ?

dude , what are you doing here ?

the corner . anarchy 99 .

first of all , you should kill whoever sold you that suit . two , i do n't wan na be here either , so just step off . three , if you had the authority to shoot me you would 've done it by now , so just ease up on the machismo , bitch . now that we 've got that sorted out , i 'm gon na get some rest .

my name is slovo , czech secret police . when you are here you are under my jurisdiction , you take my orders , you do what i say . if you become any kind of an inconvenience , i 'll shoot you .

easier than that , buddy . i 'll get them to destroy each other . you kill an entire peace conference , someone is going to have to pay . then our friend ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour . london , cairo , beijing ... pretty soon everyone 's involved . these guys bomb those guys , those guys invade these guys . soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days . no rules , no law , everybody free to do what they want .

and you . why do you have such a problem staying away , my friend ? did you miss us that much ?

do n't forget goatee boy . i greased him up on the diamond run .

my old man , he bought into the system , and it screwed him . so he swallowed a bullet . me , i do n't believe in nothing i ca n't see and touch .

hell no . my dad was a straight up tin soldier . somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged . had a court martial and everything . the charges were total bullshit , so he was sure he 'd get his name cleared , but it did n't happen .

screw the world . if i 'm gon na die for something , it better be bitches and money .

who you workin ' for ? what do you do for a living , dickhead ?

what does that mean ?

you know , you --

he takes himself seriously .

yeah ? well i do n't like to talk about my past .

the professor said you were a solider . actually , i believe he used the word mercenary .

there 's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds .

i 'm sorry to come here , ms. grey . i was afraid if i went to a hospital , they would ...

now that 's magneto talking .

alive .

how ?

the way what is going to be ?

excuse me , mr. waldman -- excuse me for interrupting . but is frederick , then ... a medical doctor ?

dr. frederick fronkonsteen .

... no !

here ! this cauliflower is useless to me .

yes , sir , he was . but he said he was obligated to lecture at johns hopkins university .

mmmmm .

is it that music ?

all right then ... seven 's always been my lucky number .

what in god 's name are you doing ?

good night .

i suppose you 're right .

you 've done everything that 's humanly possible , frederick . oh , darling , i 'm so worried about you -- you need rest .

i 've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends ... but it still comes to three thousand .

yes .

call me from new york before you leave ? ?

will there be anything else ?

i think you must be mistaken , sir .

i do n't know what you mean , sir .

one week -- i 'll see to it , sir .

what ?

no , it 's dr. fronkonsteen !

i beg your pardon ?

thanks ... for all your help .

all right -- where is she ?

yes , master !

what 's the point of my setup ? it 's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said .

yes .

do n't fall for that one .

i did n't make a 'yummy ' sound -- i just asked what it was .

to you ! you just made a 'yummy ' sound , so i thought you liked the dessert .

but there must be a reason . this is science , not art .

all right ... elevate me !

was he any good ?

could be raining !

two switches over there , but i was n't going to be the first .

you did n't hear ... nothing ! are n't there any lights in this place ?

it seems that way . you did n't hear any music at all ?

did you hear that strange music ?

there .

you must be igor .

i see .

frederick frankenstein ?

mmmmmmmmm .

it 's alive . it 's -- moving ! it 's -- breathing ! it 's -- standing ! what is your name ?

ja , ja .

i say , it would n't be fair to you ... or to me .

it would n't be fair to elizabeth .

oh , doctor !

look here - if it was n't you , and it was n't you , and it was n't me ...

reputation . reputation !

whatever it is , it 's coming from down there . i 'm going down to see .

well ...

i 'm not sure i ... get your drift .

extremely well .

another fifteen seconds to go .

igor -- the clock ! hurry !

igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain ? are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of hans delbruck that night ?

yes .

the doctor said to allow seven minutes : no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed .

food !

our friend colonel dumford will be should be at this minute approaching pulleine . i think we 'll eat here . i want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour . .

indeedldid , mylord . itwas one ofthe first to cross .

are you dictating the strategy of this war , sir ?

yes ?

er , called noggs , sir actual name is norris-newman . he presented credentials from `` the standard '' .

but will they make good use of them ?

which one ?

so far only their scouts . but we have had reports of a small impi farther north , over there .
