wow

no

thank god ! if i had to hear one more story about your coiffure ...

me . this endless ... blonde babble . i 'm like , boring myself .

do you listen to this crap ?

well , no ...

you never wanted to go out with 'me , did you ?

you know chastity ?

so that 's the kind of guy she likes ? pretty ones ?

lesbian ? no . i found a picture of jared leto in one of her drawers , so i 'm pretty sure she 's not harboring same-sex tendencies .

eber 's deep conditioner every two days . and i never , ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment .

i counted on you to help my cause . you and that thug are obviously failing . are n't we ever going on our date ?

well , there 's someone i think might be --

how is our little find the wench a date plan progressing ?

okay ... then how 'bout we try out some french cuisine . saturday ? night ?

i did .

bianca , i do n't think the highlights of dating joey dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding .

expensive ?

i just wanted --

you looked beautiful last night , you know .

not all experiences are good , bianca . you ca n't always trust the people you want to .

i 'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes .

i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him .

but

he was , like , a total babe

why ?

in 9th . for a month

bianca , i need to talk to you -- i need to tell you --

ca n't you forget for just one night that you 're completely wretched ?

can you at least start wearing a bra ?

daddy , i want to discuss the prom with you . it 's tomorrow night --

why ?

daddy , no !

it 's just a party . daddy , but i knew you 'd forbid me to go since `` gloria steinem '' over there is n't going --

daddy , i --

exactly my point

but it 's not fair -- she 's a mutant , daddy !

now do n't get upset . daddy , but there 's this boy ... and i think he might ask ...

padua girls . one tall , decent body . the other one kinda short and undersexed ?

fan of a fan . you see a couple of minors come in ?

hell , i 've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -

it 's her favorite band .

what makes you think he 'll do it ?

you wan na go out with him ?

unlikely , but even so , she still ca n't go out with you . so what 's the point ?

the mewling , rampalian wretch herself .

guess who just signed up for a tutor ?

he always have that shit-eating grin ?

because they 're bred to . their mothers liked guys like that , and their grandmothers before them . their gene pool is rarely diluted .

couple thousand . most of them evil

thirty-two .

north , actually . how 'd you ?

what 's the worst ?

you makin ' any headway ?

sure

i 've retrieved certain pieces of information on miss katarina stratford i think you 'll find helpful .

leave my sister alone .

your sister here ?

not at all

i ca n't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks .

i ca n't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend . and that 's the catch . she does n't want a boyfriend .

yeah , whatever . i want you to go out with her .

well , actually , i thought i 'd run an idea by you . you know , just to see if you 're interested .

nope - just came by to chat

you think this 'll work ?

that 's never been proven

so he has this huge raging fit about sarah lawrence and insists that i go to his male-dominated , puking frat boy , number one golf team school . i have no say at all .

i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking , but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions . you 're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy .

what 's this ?

just a little .

i 'm sure he 's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting .

don ' t you even dare . . .

why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill ?

is that right ?

it was n't like that .

nothing ! there 's nothing in it for me . just the pleasure of your company .

answer the question , patrick

create a little drama ? start a new rumor ? what ?

go to the prom with me

tell me something true .

you never disappointed me .

yes

yeah , well , do n't let it get out

i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect . and piss you off .

the partridge family ?

maybe .

i guess i never told you i 'm afraid of heights .

so what did i have an effect on ?

do n't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties .

unwelcome .

you 're so --

who ?

so what ' s up with your dad ? he a pain in the ass ?

my father would n't approve of that that

start a band ?

what ?

you know what they say

i thought you were above all that

i hate him .

see that ? who needs affection when i 've got blind hatred ?

sure , i do

why 're you doing this ?

uh , uh . you lie down and you 'll go to sleep

i just need to lie down for awhile

funny , you 're the only one

i say , do what you wan na do .

`` i 'm getting trashed , man . '' is n't that what you 're supposed to do at a party ?

depends on the topic . my fenders do n't really whip me into a verbal frenzy .

then say you 'll spend dollar night at the track with me .

the night i take you to places you 've never been before . and back .

oh , right . friday .

the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy .

was that your sister ?

i thought you were punishing me .

the point is kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...

yeah ...

yeah . i guess .

man -- do n't say shit like that to me . people can hear you .

see you next week !

you 're completely demented .

why do n't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid ?

it was a bratwurst . i was eating lunch .

i missed you .

that ' s what i thought

kissing ? is that what you think happens ? kissing is n't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day .

would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a british rear admiral ?

tumescent !

make anyone cry today ?

ca n't be that far , i say . also , i do n't like the smell of the sea around here . smells like a cunt . bad sign ...

we left three weeks ago , alonso . ca n't be that near .

i never seen heat like this ! not even in las minas !

do n't you realize your words could be considered heretical ?

no . the portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people . i , too , will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of god .

trade , your excellency . according to marco polo , the kingdom of china is one of the richest of the world . even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold .

your eminence , there is only one way to settle the matter . and that is to make the journey . i am ready to risk my life to prove it possible .

i am , your eminence

unfortunately , don colon , that is precisely where our opinions differ ... are you familiar with the work of aristotle ? erathostene ? ptolemeus ?

you can see for yourself .

on the contrary , your eminence . it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross .

it wo n't be easy to get rid of your prophet now , don sanchez .

i am busy inside .

you do n't usually ask .

thank god ...

i know .

i could be gone for years .

viceroy of the west indies .

yes ... i remember ...

he asks when he can come to visit you . he left his address .

not bad .

call them .

don bobadilla is already a judge , my dear don cristobal .

but we do have a lack of notaries . you should contact my administration .

and were you never ambitious , excellency ? or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles , a fault for the rest of us ?

tell him his country is very beautiful . tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort .

tell the chief we thank him .

i believed in you ...

i am listening , my son .

in nomine patris et filius , et spiritus sancti .

the calculations of toscanelli marin de tyr , esdras ...

how can you be so certain ? the ocean is said to be infinite .

why do you wish to sail west ?

with some difficulty . i had to promise them you were not a total fool .

god ... that 's in a week !

they come and go as naked as the day god created them ...

i know what i see . i see someone who does n't accept the world as it is . who 's not afraid . i see a women who thinks ... `` what if ? `` ...

the ocean is uncrossable ?

we do n't need to know .

if you want to keep your head on your shoulders , you 'll do as i say .

and you say this is an indian vice ? by god ! i do n't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin .

what do you read ?

and what do you think mendez ?

and then what ? half of the water has gone , the rest is nearly putrid ! you know that !

you think i do n't know that ?

you lied ! you cheated ! we 're way past 750 leagues !

because he is not afraid of me .

then , what do you suggest , don sanchez ?

your father put cigarettes out on you ?

back in the czech republic ?

tell me about yourself . what you did as a young boy ... what your parents were like .

i would say ... half . half is fair .

disappeared . they 're looking everywhere . maybe he went back to czechoslovakia .

i do n't want to drag you down with me .

in the kitchen .

right .

if you were my boyfriend , i 'd suggest you find another girlfriend that is n't going to jail ten-thousand miles away .

ludwig ? he 's gay - are you jealous ?

is he your boyfriend ?

i 'm sorry .

i still ca n't believe eddie 's gone .

you considered becoming a prostitute ?

the men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires .

they wo n't until this is over .

now i become custody of police department ?

yes , but he was a cop .

... my little sister and i shared a flat - i came home one night and a man was raping her . his gun was on the chair ... he came at me and i shot him .

look , we can help you but right now we have to deal with what 's happening here . tell us the truth ... is that the truth ?

if i tell you , will you arrest me ?

there 's nothing to talk about . get a good lawyer . you 're suspended until your trial .

but chief ? over this ? ?

what do you mean , 'cleaned up ? '

i came to see how the investigation was going . i called and you 're not here . i wait up at the station and you do n't even show up ! ! ! i beep you - you do n't return my call . where the hell have you been ? !

'cause we got more important things to do , like finding out who did it .

alright . swing by her apartment . let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to hoover street . you got that ?

you do that , wiseguy . now let 's solve this thing before eddie flemming does .

no . i 'm okay .

are you hit ?

stay with her .

c'mere . you wan na go to homicide school ? here - make yourself useful .

yeah .

still unknown but we 're running prints . kid over there caught the case .

you ready ?

coffee for me , i got ta slow down .

he had a videocamera ? where is she ? quickly !

do you have any czech girls working for you ?

what 's wrong ?

i have nothin ' to say . if you wan na contact my attorney ...

who 's there ?

but , i mean , did n't you ever go out on a limb for somebody ? i mean , you shoulda heard her there . tellin ' her whole story ... i believed her .

well , it 's not up to you to decide whether she 's innocent or not . do n't you understand , that 's why you 're a professional .

hey . i 'm a professional .

so am i .

what are you hiding ? why are you afraid

then i guess we 're doin ' this the right way , are n't we ? if we pull up to a burning building i 'll gladly let you go first .

better than one .

i 'll call it ... tails .

i 'll let you know what happens .

but what if it does ? you might need my help .

mind if i ride along with you ?

hmmmm .

if you found me steppin ' on your crime scene - it might piss you off , too . what about the report ?

nah , why should you ?

smarter than americans . you 're fed cry baby talk shows all day long . not only will americans believe me , they 'll cry for me . so ... detective eddie flemming , would you like to say goodbye to your nicolette ? maybe you can propose to her now ?

so tabloids do n't have to do re enactments . they going to have real movie this time .

what do you want ?

promise ?

okay . that is great . but i ca n't go now , we 're in the middle of something here .

yeah , well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence . that was ...

hey , honey .

i really ca n't give out any information right now at this point .

detective - can you tell us what happened here ?

is it drug related ?

again ? i did n't wan na do it the first time .

any chance we can do that again ?

are you married ?

and what do you do with the bones ?

you stuff sausage in it .

i am butcher .

okay . you work in a vodka factory . i understand that . and what kind of work do you do ?

come alone . bring cash . and we 'll talk about surrendering .

wait a minute . wait a minute .

i 'll meet you on one condition - i get exclusivity and you surrender to me .

no . i 'm the best that 's ever threatened you .

tell him to put his gun down !

the sheraton ! on broadway ! room 210. go get oleg . he 'll kill you .

c'mon . pull the trigger . do it . oh , look , you 're sweating . you do n't have the balls .

tommy , take a walk .

were you a fireman ? that how you knew how to rig the apartment ?

where is escort service ?

now i like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure . why don'tchya put my money on the dresser .

yes .

is he with you ? are you travelling together ?

how much money are you carrying with you ?

yes . both .

million ? ! the killer gets one million dollars for a television interview ?

no . you are the traitor . you are murderer . i am director . action !

yes . but there 's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - i do n't share credit .

be quiet . watch .

bad last moment - i cut it out .

i 'm serious .

why not ?

i 'm homesick . you have eastern european girl ? a czech girl ?

how you erase this ?

i 'm not filming . i 'm watching milos die . it 's just like a move but realer .

for five years i paid for your stupidness - you 'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if i say so . unless you refuse , oleg .

okay .

okay .

just do what i do . say the same thing i say . do n't open your mouth .

you spent all the money while i was in prison ? now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets ? ! ?

a job ? ? as a plumber ? ? ? you think i come to america to work !

it 's easy to learn .

we spent it !

did you hurt her ?

surprise ! surprise !

emil ? ? ? !

this footage will work in your favor . when the jury sees this - no matter what cutler tries , they 'll convict him .

of course he 's moody . he thinks he 's in love .

i 'm trying to tell you .

i want to hear everything he said .

well , he ...

a cheap hotel .

then answer my questions . where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you 're here ?

yes ... he 's my friend .

he 's yours but i take him in ! i 'll drive him to the precinct , you can have him but i 'm walkin ' him in .

what was that ?

no . go ahead .

your civil rights ? ! you tried to rob me ! i could arrest you right now ! you 're lucky you 're walking away from this . now get outta here .

you okay ?

okay , you 're under arrest ! now you happy ?

look , i do n't have time for you , get out of my way ! !

how did you start the fire this time ?

yeah , i 'm religious . i 'm not an atheist like you ! now , are you guys gon na arrest me , or not ?

they were inside . they booby trapped her apartment !

it hurts . aw , jesus !

you go home . i 'm takin ' your car and goin ' back to the crime scene .

yeah ?

that 's why he was so quiet . he was testing us .

clean ?

where you been , man ? we got a celebrity !

do n't you get it ? he knew he was gon na get caught ! that 's why he videotaped eddie 's murder - he thinks he 's gon na get off .

what are you gon na do ?

that does n't apply to me because i 'm not a criminal . i 'm not a criminal ! i was n't convicted .

permanently disrupted ? are n't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money ? has n't this 'incident ' as you call it , jump started your career as an artist ?

you seem very savvy for a man who 's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial .

how did they manage to do that without any communication ?

continued

continued

i guess not .

i did n't do that frank . i took particular care not to freeze them .

yes .

you 're kidding .

well ... hal 's reported the ao-unit about to fail again .

still , all we have to do is ask hal .

i know . it would be almost inconceivable .

not really . though , it is strange when you think about it . it did n't really make any sense to keep us apart during training .

of course , it would be very easy for us to find out now .

i do n't think we should make any fuss about it yet . i 'm sure they 'll straighten it out .

it 's possible .

okay , come on down .

okay .

listen to me very carefully , hal . unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order i give from this point on , i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection .

the antenna has to be replaced .

i suppose it 's because you 've been under a lot of stress , but have you forgotten that they 're not supposed to be revived for another three months .

is your confidence in me fully restored ?

you probably also know that we found them okay .

the unit is still operational , dave . but it will fail within seventy-two hours .

continued

coninued

yes , i remember you mentioning it . i got mine about the same time .

thank you , daddy .

are you coming to my party ?

yes , i know that sweetheart .

i 'm fine , daddy . when are you coming home ?

berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight .

oh , she 's growing up very fast . as a matter of fact , she 's six tomorrow .

i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking .

yes , i think so . just about then .

well , thank you very much for being so understanding .

how do you do , mr. miller ?

fortunately , they did .

yes ... well , i hope the crew got back safely .

yes , and i 'm afaid there 's going to be a bit of a row about it . denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the i.a.s . convention .

well , as it happens , i 'm on my way up to the moon

yes , really , thank you very much .

oh , i really do n't have time for a drink . if it 's all right i 'll just sit for a minute and then i 've got to be off .

but you do n't have any idea as to what it is ?

yes , it does . the sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago .

yes , well , i would n't have been too concerned about it , except i 've heard these stories about the epidemic and , as a matter of fact , i 've heard that ten people have died already .

i see . well , i 'm sorry about that . i would n't think there 's any cause for alarm .

i take it this is something to do with the trouble they 're having up at clavius ?

what do you mean ?

incidentally , dr. floyd , i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements ?

thank you .

oh , no , thank you . the two girls have taken wonderful care of me . i 'm just fine .

when do we arrive at clavius ?

opening pod bay doors .

hal , check all airlock doors secure .

hal , i 'm going out now to replace the a.o . unit .

five by five , frank .

hal , have pod arms secure the component .

there is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program , and to further our general knowledge of the planets . is that true ?

that 's true

that we do . and we put air in the tires . i 'll even sell you some gas if you need it .

yeah , i 've been busy .

this is three years old .

hammond .

try obeyin ' the law once in awhile , and i wo n't have to hassle you ...

i do n't give a damn about his girl ...

fuck off . i do n't know what the hell you 're talkin ' about .

no , man , i think i 'll have a vodka .

vodka .

he 's just kiddin ' , you just keep doin ' what i tell ya , you 'll be okay .

just do what i say , okay ? we 'll pay for the girls and have a good time ... do n't you trust me ?

yeah , dummy . money .

you 're in a hurry .

excuse me , baby , but if i do n't get some action tonight , i 'm gon na bust . you interested ?

i used to go with him ... i do n't know where the hell he is . i have n't seen him for two weeks . and i do n't think i will . he owes me money ...

i do n't think you 're gon na make it .

what are you talking about ? we did n't kill her ...

you lying son of a bitch ...

no trouble , jack . but , listen , suppose i stay a crook ? where 'd you get the idea that you could catch me ?

okay , reggie , start bustin ' my chops ... tell me how great you were with that chick .

you did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own ...

you okay ?

do n't worry about it .

it 's late , they 're closing ...

naw , you did n't let me down . it was a long shot all the way . we gave 'em a good run at it .

when you been in prison three years , it do n't take long . let 's go .

i can just take her right across the street to luther 's hotel . all i need is some money for the room .

i do n't know why , but i 'm going to let you keep it . maybe because you told me you had it , or maybe just because i 'm too tired to argue ...

let him get some sleep . he 's going to need it .

hello . and goodbye .

where 's luther ?

bullshit . then i 'm staying with the money .

class is n't somethin ' you buy , punk . look at you , five hundred dollar suit and you 're still a lowlife .

you know , i 'd be embarrassed if i let my wheels go the way you 've done with this job .

if they do n't tell me what i need to know ...

say , do you always work people over like you did luther ?

that ai n't philosophy . that 's common sense .

i 'm tellin ' you the man 's in love ... he wants to be a hero for his girl .

you 'd think the guy 'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed .

jesus christ . that 's a disgrace the guy pulls a gun on a cop and he 's out in 24 hours . i tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door .

musta got some primo bondsman .

i was n't sure the money was still there until we saw luther . you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once , not twice , jack .

where 's the goddamn car ?

get this . we ai n't partners . we ai n't brothers . we ai n't friends . if ganz gets away with my money , you 're gon na be sorry we ever met .

in the trunk of a car . a lot better than under a mattress , right ?

jesus .

half a million .

one thing 's for sure , jack . that 's how you 'll tell the story .

naw , you 'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time .

yeah , right . you want to try again ?

let 's go .

you made that move , huh ?

this place do n't seem real popular with the brothers .

you tell me what ganz busted out for , he 's after a lot more than just gettin ' out of jail . and whatever it is , you 're part of it .

what are you talkin ' about ?

that 's never been one of my problems .

i got two problems . number one , i 'm not playin ' games . number two , you got nothin ' to bet with .

bullshit . attitude and experience get you through ...

this part of town , they 'll make us for heat the second we walk in . just back me up like you 've got a piece ...

who 'd you call on the phone back at the booking station ?

bullshit ... i ai n't moving till i get something to eat . you 've been treating me like shit ever since i came out here . if you do n't like it , you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye . and i want some food some place nice.. some good people , nice music ...

just throw me the goddamn gun .

it looks like you bought it off one of the brothers .

shit . i 'm already sorry .

get this . we ai n't partners . we ai n't brothers . we ai n't friends . i 'm puttin ' you down and keepin ' you down until ganz is locked up or dead . and if ganz gets away , you 're gon na be sorry we ever met .

bullshit .

did n't work out that way . he busted out with a big indian . they capped two guards on a road gang . nice meeting you reggie .

you here to write my life story ?

where the christ do you think you 're going ?

they ran . as fast as they could . caught a train .

how did they get away ?

jack ?

jack , come on , there is an official department policy about cop killings . cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian ... in other words , we ca n't seen like we 're in the revenge business ... i know , we all know the truth 's a little different .

yeah , i read the report ...

i want to be left alone on this one . algren was killed with my gun .

are you gon na tell me about police procedure ? do me a favor , do n't give me a bunch of crap .

that 's what you say , cates ...

okay . see you in the morning ... you know , you ought to get some rest ...

i 'm heading out . how about you ?

nothing came in for me yet ? no calls ?

you look awful .

hey ... dick tracy .

wait a minute , wait a minute ... who 's this ?

they all pulled a bunch of jobs with ganz about four years ago .

backup man from the east bay . worked with ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang .

billy bear ...

shit .

who gives a fuck what you think ?

that 's what i always say .

three more hours ...

i 've been waiting a long time to hear you say that .

usual bullshit . you make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend ... you know somethin ' , shootin ' guys sucks . especially compared to this .

how 'd they take it back at headquarters ?

oh , yeah , well look where you came when you were down and out .

it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions . i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week , jack , and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian ... now , if this indian 's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him , it could just be she 's still vulnerable to him .

what makes you think they were lesbians , or as you so quaintly put it , dykes ?

hello .

jack , wait ...

elaine , i got ta put you on hold ...

no , it 's i 'm just surprised you called .

yeah , guess it must have been a slow news day ...

yeah , one of my favorites .

yeah , for some reason , i 'm sure ...

maybe i would if i knew when you were coming back .

maybe you ought to buy me one .

i think you 're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear ... you pull down four bills a week which is damn good , and you mix the best pina coladas i 've ever had ... i think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em .

hey , you know what i really think ?

i do n't think your gun 's loaded ...

i do n't answer questions , i ask 'em ...

that 's no bull .

shrink major , not a shrink .

well , i been workin ' the other side of the street for the last few years . and you do n't exactly look like a shrink , wearin ' that dress ...

i 'm not so sure i can say the same thing ... you do n't look like a cop .

name 's hammond , reggie hammond . i heard a lot about you . and any friend of jack 's is a friend of mine .

yeah , old times .

hot ? hey , they 're not even room temperature .

come on , you can trust me . please .

i ca n't get it until monday . honest .

when ?

do n't give me this , we were partners .

surprise , luther .

how about some ammo ?

you sure ?

vano da , mechteba ? ! soun domo kala chon hammas !

you know exactly where they are !

the case..with the stones ... where is it ?

let me reassure you father..i will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years .

no thank you .

... i 'm a priest ! i 'm here to serve life , all you want to do is destroy it .

why ? what 's wrong with me ?

i 'm glad you got your memory back , father ... because you 're going to need it ... where are the stones ?

zorg . jean-baptiste emmanuel zorg ... nice to see you again

there 's no light ! you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light .

what are you doing ?

excuse me ! just one thing ! she said something to me a while ago and ... i do n't really get it ... akta gamat ?

thank you so much for your help mr ... ?

who are you ?

weddings are one floor down . congratulations .

did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop ? you ca n't even tell me what it is ! i ask you for options you give me bullshit . give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards .

time is of no importance , mr. president . only life is important .

nothing ! swear to god , i did n't do nothing !

fuck it ! hold tight !

he 's on vacation .

got it ...

i did n't have a dad ... never saw him ... never even heard him . 50 billion people listen to me every day ... and he does n't hear me ...

i do n't think this is a good time ...

i 'll take you to the bar , after that , you 're on your own .

i did n't come here to play dumbo on the radio . so tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand , that clear pal ?

oh , yes you will ...

i 've had enough good news for today

thanks..

uh..

do n't fuck with me man or i 'll blow you into tomorrow !

been here long ?

sounds like a freak of nature to me .

talk english doc .

i managed to contact the mondoshawan . they deplore the incident , but accept our apologies .

my philosophy mr. president is shoot first ask questions later . i do n't like uninvited guests .

recommendations .

right away , sir . i 'll send you a new one to the hotel .

yes , sir !

how 's that ? can you hear me better now ?

am i disturbing you ?

she 's all i 've got . she 's the only witness .

do n't ...

amy , i 'm not going to let anything happen to us .

you could n't ?

it has to be this way for now . it wo n't be long .

i 'm okay , honey , i 'm okay . are you alright ?

tom ? where have you been ... ?

hello ?

it 's a missing persons case ... a long shot . i 'll give it two months , two months at most , then i 'll be back . we 'll take a vacation .

i understand .

you 're not using the same guy who tried to fix it ?

i 'm not accusing you ...

smoking ? i 'm not smoking .

mixed hard bondage . rape films . sick shit . buy five , get one free .

dino ...

there 's nothing there , you brain- dead cunt . think about it . there 's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything . i want you to hang the phone up , and if you call me about this again i 'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader .

blow me , you paranoid fuck , that 's impossible . why are you bothering me with this ... ?

i 'll get it . it 's in a safe deposit box , in the city ...

shut up , cunt ! do exactly as i say , or i 'll put this arrow through your throat .

sure .

he 's in . it will be his pleasure .

those are two different kinds of trust . thank you for your time . i hope we can do business .

you trust me to keep your money , but not to take your picture ?

if it 's not him , there 's no deal .

and the other performer ... it has to be that monster you use ... the man in the mask .

i want to watch you work .

and they are ?

is it ?

you said something about money .

you got the guts , tough guy ? gon na kill us all , is that it ?

well , that 's all i can do . sorry .

they were pretty clear they did n't want this coming back on them .

for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive .

easy enough for you .

do it ! put me out of my misery so i do n't have to listen to you whining anymore . you think it 's so easy ?

do n't think i wo n't .

i fucking do n't know . what do you think ... we were n't burying treasure . we did n't pace it out so we could come back and get it . we dug a hole and we put her in it . your guess is as good as mine .

you got absolute zero .

stop talking .

show me .

took it out the bathroom window . buried it in the woods .

what do you want to know ? you saw it , you saw the loop ...

made me sick , but what did i care ? what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that . it was just something i was doing for money .

why ?

how much did he pay you ?

told him you could get him a snuff film .

i told you , i do n't know .

who is machine ?

fuck you !

what 's he talking about ?

you killed that girl and you put it on film . you and your pals , you 're fucked . you fucked up real good .

you murdered that girl , eddie . six years ago ...

yeah , who 's this ?

i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month . do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt , and try to fucking return it ?

go ahead , shoot me . then try driving to brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield .

give me the film .

fuck you .

is n't it incredibly obvious ?

mary anne mathews , that was her name . her mom remembers her .

well , whatever reasons mrs. christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator , i should certainly be a party to . but , since she feels differently , i can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval .

you are a private investigator ?

of what sort ?

as mr. christian 's attorney and one of the executors of his estate , it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend .

it 's not my money . the woman i got it from is never going to give it a second thought . let 's not make a big deal out of this , okay ? go be a race car driver . go run for president . whatever .

look ... that 's awful generous and everything ...

still do n't want to tell me what you 're doing ?

what kind of junior p.i . would i be if i did n't go with you ?

you did n't say it was gon na be this luxurious .

see ya .

you 're learning .

you just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else .

i do n't mean any offense ... but what are you doing mixed up in all this ?

first of all , basement sales like tonight are n't gon na last much longer . it 's too risky , one , and two , everything 's going on the internet . anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants . it 's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks . they 're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em . but , there 's still some weird shit under the counter where i work sometimes . no one knows where it comes from . that 's local underground , where information spreads by word of mouth . those are zombies , hardcore junkies . their hands are permanently pruned . they go out in the sun they do n't burn , they blister . other than that , all i know about is the mail . classified ads in the paper with hidden codes . secret couriers . credit card orders to dummy corporations . interstate wire transfers . revolving p.o . boxes . but , if you 're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit ... who knows ? that 's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible , and vice versa , and cops ca n't trace the deal . there 's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is .

what other ways are there to get illegal films ? who do you see ?

i heard you asking . that guy was n't yanking you around . there 's no such thing .

there 's two kinds of specialty product ; legal and illegal . foot fetish , shit films , watersports , bondage , spanking , fisting , she- males , hemaphrodites ... it 's beyond hardcore , but legal . this is the kind of hardcore where one guy 's going to look at it and throw up , another guy looks at it and falls in love . now , with some of the s+m and bondage films , they straddle the line . how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not ? step over that line , you 're into kiddie porn . rape films , but there are n't many . i 've never seen one .

what you saw tonight , we 're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend . we 're talking about stuff where people get hurt . specialty product .

... hello ... ?

from pennsylvania . p.i . from pa. what are you doing out here ?

you 're not a cop , are you ? if i ask and you are , you have to tell me .

max .

i do n't know what you 're looking for , mister , but so we 're clear from the start , i 'm straight .

thomas welles . nice picture .

came back for that battery-operated vagina , right ? told you you would .

remember me ?

yeah ... guess so .

big date tonight ?

nothing more than a bother . have you any news for me ?

you told me to look , so i looked .

i deal in divorce cases . corporate investigations ...

you do n't have any other choice .

i told you i ca n't , not yet .

cash , stock certificates , and this ...

do you want to tell me what you found ?

i try to be .

he raped her and ... and ... and he murdered her ... he cut her up with knifes ...

who is this ... ?

mrs. mathews , your daughter is dead . she 's dead .

you were right . i did n't find anything . i 'm going to run and get something to eat . are you hungry ?

if the police focused their search in her room , her belongings , well that 'd be only natural , but they may have been looking in the wrong place .

no . you do n't have any reason to think that ...

it 's not really my place , but it 's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either . see , i know a little about missing persons . when kids run , they almost always leave a note . it 's guilt . they want to say goodbye .

no .

we 're all like that .

i ... i should n't take anymore of your time . maybe we can finish tomorrow . i 'll call tomorrow ...

of course .

you try going through what we did . bob could n't take it , that 's all . christ , there 's times when it still seems like i ca n't either .

if there 's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about , tell me , but i have to ask . your husband ... he committed suicide ?

no .

they hired you . you 're like , a private detective ?

right , agent cole told me he 'd call and let you know to expect me . he did n't call ?

yes , but ...

whatever possessed you to keep this all this time ?

none too discreet , is he ?

certainly , sir .

i 'm required by state law to inform you that , while it 's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items , it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of ...

alright . may i have your phone number , area code first ?

figure it out ? ! ? ! i 'll be insane before i figure it out . the only thing i 'm sure of is that i ca n't go to sleep . not while he 's using me .

i ca n't go back to sleep again .

yeah , or turn you into toast .

it is ... was . it 's a zapper , it might help me stay awake .

does n't the dream master work for you anymore ?

what ?

alice , you think you can leave ?

yeah . she 'd be half as strict as you .

you what ?

no really , it 's a fable . the 'guardian of good ' dreams . it was like my teddy bear when i was growing up .

here you are . where were you this morning ? rick 's looking all over for you .

saw who ? i was up all night cramming for this physics test , and i was putting this little baby together . look ...

you know , i get the weirdest feeling we 've been through this before .

it 's okay , we 're just about there .

he 's going after debbie , i got ta stop him .

try what other kids did . keep each other awake . we 'll meet at debbie 's tonight . at least if we do n't sleep he ca n't get us .

you do n't really get it . he 's not a nightstalker . it 'll take more than bench presses to beat him .

kristen was the last child left of the people who killed freddy . maybe freddy ca n't get to new kids without someone like me . someone to bring them to him .

i was there in the dream . he took her . it was awful . it was awful ...

no ...

i saw it . it was my dream . i brought sheila in ...

enough of that crap .

give her time . beauty is skin deep .

hey man , we 're all sorry ...

i do n't get it .

honey , we went over this in therapy .

i 'm sorry honey , but ...

you 're just tired . do n't think i have n't noticed your not sleeping . that has to stop , honey .

i told you you ca n't help . this is n't a normal nightmare . i 'm doomed .

it 's no story . it happened . freddy 's real and he 's back .

i though freddy was just an old town story .

now you know who and what freddy really is .

what ?

something wrong with the stairs ?

you had a nasty bump .

you 're not taking my baby !

we know you 've been through a lot but there 's more than your feelings at stake here .

in your present condition , alice , we 're worried about your ability --

look , i appreciate what you 're offering , but no . he is my responsibility .

what i what ? well , i 've thought about it . i plan to keep him .

mommy ... ?

hi , you do n't look very well . are you feeling all right ?

my name is ...

about him ?

he 'll show up . c'mon , what 's really wrong ?

okay , babe . what 's the matter ?

jesus ! do n't do that !

to take a picture .

so did dan .

but how are we gon na --

are you alright ?

that 's the only reason you 're alive ...

look ... we 're all tired . none of us had any sleep since friday night ...

all i know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman . why do n't you take off - leave springwood and cool out somewhere for a while ?

i just ca n't figure out how he 's getting in when i 'm awake ...

mark knows i 'm not crazy . ask him to show you his hands .

i think krueger 's trying to do something to it .

no , the dan part was nice ...

she killed herself . her soul 's gon na be in torment .

poor woman ...

where are you going ?

i do n't know !

why do n't i go make some coffee . there 's a lot to tell .

it was n't her mother . the only reason we 're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party .

i 'm very fucking sorry , but greta is dead today . could we interest you in someone else ?

i do n't believe this ... all that gore you paint in the comics and you 're squeamish ?

you know my mother -- get real . what about alice 's ?

that club sucks , they card everybody . let 's just party at your place .

yeah , when are you gon na come to your senses ?

i want to talk about the baby .

have another one , sounds like you need it .

makes you look like a nun --

you , too ?

stick around , please ?

why do n't you shut up and let her talk ! two of us died in the last two days , does that strike you as particularly normal ? !

unidentified flying objects .

we 're < u > all < /u > risking our lives !

and they thought < u > you < /u > could re- place the skipper ?

how is he - ?

we 'll have to look for them later .

wonder where powell and carney are ?

yeah ?

reef and i can take the explorer down , clamp it around the eye , and -- -

you 've got to let us try , skipper --

cyclops ?

so ?

one of the finest men , and officers , alive . a real hero - in the best sense of the word - in world war two . he taught us engineering and design . fought like a demon to develop atom subs .

i guess .

i might have a son like < u > that ! < /u >

huh ?

< u > that 's < /u > the worst possible moment ?

right at our one-eyed friend !

is there any way out of it ?

what ? ? ? ?

skipper - could you take a look here ... ?

all internal repairs completed , and frogmen report exterior damage minor .

excuse me , skipper -- -

what about time ... ?

anything -- -

wonderful !

as ready as we < u > can < /u > be ! i 'll report to the skipper .

all ready ?

there 's got to be an explanation !

what direction does the system indicate ?

the north pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the earth itself !

under < u > water < /u > ?

what ?

suppose there 's an atmosphere , of some kind , inside cyclops ?

it 's the screws , skipper . at our declination angle , running in reverse , they 're pulling the shark < u > and < /u > cyclops right to the bottom .

a hundred and eighty fathoms ! we ca n't be sinking that fast ... .

we can < u > ram < /u > him !

that 's what i said !

i think i should have joined the air force !

it is a living thing . when damaged - you would say 'wounded ' - it immediately 'heals ' itself .

why not me ? what am i - the closing act ?

- for horrors like yourself ?

point of view is everything . to us , < u > your < /u > form of life is ugly as we appear to you .

come where ?

but < u > answers < /u > are what we need - not more questions !

well , i 'll be - !

has anybody offered to buy it ?

you do n't believe me ?

sometimes things are simpler than you think . let me ask you a question .

you know jack hewitt , the kid i work with ?

alma , i think there 's some dirty business going on in this town .

he 's a selectman . the town . he said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office . i 'm supposed to pull the cb and police light out of your car . they 're town property .

tell me .

what are you boys up to ?

yes .

i plan to . soon .

i screwed up the divorce . i agreed with everything she said . i wanted her to like me . i just want to be a good father .

we bought you .

this way .

yeah .

what happened ?

they said .

i used to play ball .

follow close . we 'll cross the next meadow .

wonderful !

mmm .

yeah .

yep . right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles . the bucks are right behind them and we 're right behind the bucks . this gun gets fired before ten o'clock . whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you . i 'll put you inside 30 , 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season . that 's what you 're paying me for , ai n't it ?

what do you mean i got money ? i 'm as broke as you .

well , i did n't actually see him do it . like i said .

i never seen a man shot before . not even in the service . must be something .

musta ... how 'd i know ? what 're you doing , playing cop ?

what blood ?

where 'd you get the blood ?

a half mile in , along the old lumber road .

yeah , he 'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him .

gordon , he 's always got some angle working . he wants to keep twombley happy , i 'm his boy .

how 'd you get the job ?

some job . here , have a hit . do n't be such a hardass . i know you got problems , but everybody 's got problems .

relax , chief . we 're leaving . you wan na toke ?

oh .

i know .

you ca n't .

i want to go home .

okay .

no .

oh .

i 'm glad you 're here . can you stay for a while ?

yes .

that 's all you got to say ? `` yes '' .

see , i knew you 'd be mad .

come and get you ! shit ! it 's a damn half hour drive each way . why did n't you talk to me about it first ?

jesus , why ?

jesus . listen , jill , tell you what . tomorrow morning , you still want to go home , i 'll drive you down . i 'll get off work or something .

why ? why not ? you know these kids from when you went to school here . it has n't been that long .

no . she does n't talk about you anymore .

no . i did n't used to be bad . no sir . where do you get this stuff ? from your mother ?

was it funny ?

yeah . it 's stupid .

ca n't you see ... look out there . nobody 's got their porch lights on anymore . it 's too late . those hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble . see , they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there . they chopped down herb crane 's new bushes . little bastards . jesus h. christ .

those are the hoyts .

yeah .

you two , do n't you get it ? he 's using you . you 're his slaves . jesus christ , jack , do n't you see that ?

i saw mel gordon in here this morning .

on what you pay me ?

yeah . a few things .

that must 've been twombley . jesus . i bet that was twombley .

i wish you had . i 'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader .

i shoulda sent you instead of jack .

a hunting accident . jack and twombley .

his son-in-law damn near killed me .

tomorrow , gordon .

got here just in time . go ahead . jump in line . maybe you 'll win a prize .

no problem . look , i ...

let the past be . i 'm sorry about your mother . i liked her . you never know how much women like that suffer . it 's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they 're gone .

no , not anymore . it 's too ... it 's too far .

i 'm not making it any worse . you are . me and jill could 've worked this thing out . it 's normal , it 's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it . believe it or not . how do you think this makes me look , treating her like some tragic victim or something ?

from boston . evan twombley 's son-in- law -- he was driving . i know where they 're headed . up the lake , agaway . the old man 's out deer hunting with jack hewitt , so they probably got some big weekend party planned .

i know who it is .

did you get his number ?

did you see that sonofabitch in the bmw ? he could 've killed somebody .

do n't be silly . hi , jill .

look , that 's temporary , believe me . there 's so much shit gon na hit the fan the next few days , my getting fired by lariviere and merritt wo n't matter a bit .

jesus christ , pop , let 's go home . i got waylaid . sorry .

what happened ?

think they 're alright ?

good .

you 've been married twice --

i 've been thinking about it , that 's all .

there 's another thing i 've been thinking about . i do n't know how you feel about the idea , margie , because we 've never talked about it . but i 've been thinking lately , i 've been thinking we should get married sometime . you and me .

lots of people . guy like evan twombley , boston union official , probably got lots of people want to see him dead . the government 's been investigating his links with the mafia .

i 've been wondering if maybe jack shot twombley , instead of twombley shooting himself . i 've been wondering maybe jack shot him on purpose .

there 's something funny about that shooting . there 's lots funny about it , actually .

forget it .

about you and jill and needing a third person . she went back to lillian ?

yeah .

how 's she doing ?

makes me sad it was her . instead of me . i shoulda froze .

maybe wade should take a look at it . your pipes 'll freeze . wade , would you do that ?

doing your fucking job . i know . i watch television too .

ca n't it wait , then ?

jack ?

marg !

this town sucks .

where the christ you going ? you sonofabitch , you leave my fucking truck where it is ! i need ... give me the goddamn keys ! i need to get me to town !

bang !

everything you know is from me .

yeah .

that 's what you think .

i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop . i was a careful child and i became a careful adult , but at least i was n't afflicted by that man 's violence .

well , i never heard that one .

you think i would n't remember a thing like that ?

of course it happened . why would i lie about it ?

so mel gordon would n't want a professional hit . that 'd make the feds dig deeper . he wants an accident .

motive . you got ta have a motive .

that it was n't an accident .

which is ?

i guess it was an accident , like everybody thinks .

yeah . i forgot .

have n't you already done a bit of that ?

what happened ?

the night before the shooting .

they were out deer hunting , right ? jack probably heard the gun go off , then came back and found the body .

who ?

rolfe .

some kids were teasing you ?

no , it 's okay . after all , he is the president , right ?

hey joey , how ` bout a cocoa , double whip cream .

yeah , no duh .

it would be a pity to squander such a strong personality .

that 's the way of the world , little one . did n't they teach you that in school ?

yeah . do you know what the word & quot ; asshole & quot ; means .

it was the experience of a lifetime .

hey , you guys back already ?

they are in our airspace . we would be within our rights .

did we warn them off ?

okay , you 're aerated . to dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump . there 's no switch in avionics so you 'll have to cross the wires . there should be five wires , just to your left . do you see them ?

okay , it 's on . we 've got some indicator lights here .

lem me take a look .

just stay on my wing , sir . i 'll take you all the way in .

how we doing , colonel ?

okay . we 're gon na arc a fat one to the right . got it ?

i 'm doing what i can .

we do n't know that .

can we do that ?

because it is my duty .

yes , mr. president .

ga get it .

please change course to zero seven four and drop to eighteen thousand feet . over .

we 're not going to make it .

go ! take serge.. and watch your backs .

avionics compartment ! it 's the only place . you better get zedeck down there fast unless , of course , you 'd rather be a martyr than a savior .

remarkable aircraft . remarkable .

who did this ?

how many others killed ?

the rest of the secret service ?

copy , air force one .

romeo tango zulu , do you have the president ? over .

romeo tango zulu , copy one the television , graphics of the first family against the presidential seal .

thank you .

here 's a press kit . i 'll let you guys get comfortable and once we 're airborne i 'll be able to schedule the interviews .

a dubious distinction , no ?

ms. mitchell . so nice to finally meet you in person .

jim ...

the world is such a dangerous place and we ca n't always protect our children .

that was war .

do you have to be so brutal ?

i know he left you behind .

leave my daughter alone .

come on , alice .

if you put down the gun , i promise not to drop her on the way down .

stop .

pity . mr. gibbs .

over my dead body .

yes . you 've made yourself quite clear .

you heard me . you . congress and cabinet heads .

twenty minutes ?

okay , gentlemen , we 'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane ... lee , go huddle with the d.o.d . i want an options paper on this in 20 minutes .

our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground . our hands are completely tied while they 're in the air .

yes , sir .

got it .

we ca n't jump from here or at this speed . but if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane ...

we 've already played our cards , major . there 's no turning back .

you have n't even driven a car since you took office .

what are you doing ?

please ... do n't start with me .

but that 's the point , jim . we 're right here .

i miss you . and i miss her .

and when have i had five minutes ? when i wake up in the morning and i 'm already three hours behind schedule . what do you want me to do , rose , tell the g7 to fuck off because i 'm a family man ?

she 's a big girl . she understands .

for godsakes , jim , slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy . not even you can plug all the world 's leaks . do n't you think it 's a sign you 're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on mtv news than in person .

no , mr. president . it ca n't .

may i speak to you for a moment ?

please , mr. president . you 're going to get yourself killed . is that your solution ?

sir , the president does not call this particular number . so whoever you are get a life , before i have this call traced .

they better . fuel 's almost gone .

shepherd .

okay . hey , pumpkin , you 'll tell me all about it later , right ?

sir , the speaker of the house attacked this administration on national television . you ca n't afford to leave that hanging .

it 's bait . do n't take it .

right ... christ i 'm tired . do me a favor and keep me away from the press .

i might still have a few chips left .

he and the nra do n't like the wording .

i always wondered if my freshman russian class would come in handy .

* cbs said they 'll give us four minutes . they thought the russian was a nice touch .

some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor ...

forget it . i was reading .

you 've made your point , commissioner . there 's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that 's clarence oveur . he 's got a lunar flight today . i want him pulled . jacobs , pull oveur !

i just wish it was that simple .

you handle your front office people , i 'll handle the press and leave the boys in washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board .

bud , get wise to the political realities . the boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown .

what is it , mary ?

you better check it , unger .

dunn .

are you afraid ?

that might be the news we 've been waiting for .

well , elaine , this might be it if those guys on the ground do n't think of something .

i mean until we start to burn up .

ted , a toilet 's not going to kill anyone .

what would you say if i told you the toilet just blew up in my face .

ted . i do n't know why you got on this flight . i do n't know what you 're trying to prove .

ted !

if that 's the way you want it .

and when are you going to realize , ted , that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now .

elaine , when are you going to realize simon kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way .

there 's nothing wrong with me !

ted , what 's wrong ?

te ... !

so you see , our task is n't made any easier by ted 's refusal to admit that he 's sick .

the human brain is a highly complex organ , elaine , perhaps the most complex next to the bladder . let me show you . ted 's problem is in this area . this area , this area , here , here , here , under here , here ...

ted seemed to get worse after i told him about simon , doctor .

simon , what are you saying ? !

he tried to disconnect rok . it gassed him . that computer is running this ship and we 're heading right for the sun .

roger .

meet me onboard , sweetheart . i have to pick up a few things at the drugstore .

i guess this is a first for you .

i 'm so excited , simon .

women < u > and < /u > the space program have come a long way , sweetheart . but after the wedding , no more complicated computers for my little girl .

simon .

no , i mean you can do it from the cockpit .

yes , sir .

there 's nothing wrong with me , elaine . what about tonight -- just you and me . we can be alone . i can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- i 've already proven < u > that < /u > .

life support check . elaine , it 's obvious you 've been ignoring me . you 're a woman . i can relate to that .

that 's not possible .

that does n't make sense . repeat analysis .

intermitant failure in scan mode `` r '' . analyze .

look , a man can make an honest mistake ! ! anyway , she was asking for it ! they 're all asking for it all the time ! !

scraps .

okay , joey . the doc says you got ta relax . this hospital in des moines is the best sex clinic in the country .

you 're sure ?

joe , you do n't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people .

how would you like your eggs , captain ? over .

a couple eggs and juice would be nice , mary . over .

anything . just do n't let salucci think we 're onto him .

a b ...

sixteen ' c ' , why ?

you folks need any help ?

you ca n't go in there !

then elaine was right .

striker .

not if the people change together in relation to that love .

we were in love but i 'm not sure i know what love is anymore .

no , i mean your head . sit down . i 'll take a look at it . i 'm a nurse .

not dr. barrington , the world renowned agronomist ?

no . i 'm all alone .

i wish i could fool myself into believing that that 's the reason . the truth of the matter is , nobody ever asked me .

well , after a thing like that you would n't be expected to .

thank you . cream ?

shep , no ! he gets so excited when new people are here .

well , to tell the truth , they really did n't fill me in on many of the details . just told me to pick up captain kramer .

oh , yes . come in , paul . rex will be right out .

hello , i 'm paul carey from the airline . i 'm here to pick up captain kramer .

ca n't you take a guess ?

extremely serious . it starts with a slight fever .

let 's see now . the co-pilot had fish . what did the navigator eat ?

what did he have ?

the gear is down .

it 's a damn good thing he does n't know how much i hate his guts .

rain .

a lot of people made plans before the war . like george zipp .

what 's his problem ?

be patient , ted . no one expects you to get over this immediately .

seven . lieutenant zipp died this morning . ted , doctor sandler says you 'll be out in a week . is n't that wonderful ?

headquarters ! ? what is it ?

you got a telegram from headquarters today .

mostly i remember ... the nights when we were together . i remember how you used to hold me ... and how i used to sit on your face and wriggle ... and then afterwards how we 'd watch until the sun came up . when it did , it was almost like ... like each new day was created ... only for us .

elaine , just hear me out . i know things have n't been right for a long time . but it will be different ... like it was in the beginning . remember ?

my orders came through . my squadron ships out tomorrow . i 'll be leading a very important mission .

what 's the matter ?

but if you 'll just give me ...

you expect me to believe that ?

do n't you feel anything for me at all any more ?

ted !

i think so , but i 've never seen it so acute .

who wants to be first ?

good-bye , darling . i love you . i love you , darling .

bill ! bill ! good-bye , bill .

every day .

he 's right on the heading .

watch your altitude , striker . it 's too erratic . you ca n't come straight in . you 've got enough fuel left for two hours flying . you 've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather .

... and that lots of times you do n't even run down court .

i 'm an airline pilot . ah , clarence , according to my calculations , with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the rockies .

okay , this is one of my favorites .

yes , of course . we both had fish . why ?

well , the doctor will be with you in just a moment . one thing : do you know what he had for dinner ?

huh ?

no . no thank you .

fourteen-b . it 's halfway down on your right .

does that cost extra or you throw them in ?

we are with the police department . this is sergeant sykes , and i am --

that 's right .

i may be an asshole , but at least i 'm a real detective , not some outer shit space thing .

well , if it is n't detective jetson . forget you hip waders , big guy ?

look at your dildo partner . he 's too scared to even come down to the sand . you 're not gon na get wet standing here , moron !

yes ...

that cop , the human , he was the one who killed anderson and the driver .

how do i look ?

why the hell are you so dead set against back-up ?

harcourt is dead .

no ! we must do this alone .

ss-ai !

why ? what 's the big goddamn deal ?

where is the drug ? where have they taken it ?

we all did .

you must leave me alone on this .

what 's this nothing shit ? it was n't nothing yesterday when you asked bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits , and it 's not nothing now . do n't lie to me , george , you 're bad at it .

a man , a human , was wiring it to your car . i did n't get a good look at him . i must call my wife ...

you humans are very curious to us . you invite us to live among you , in an atmosphere of equality we 've never known before . you lay before us a beautiful green world , full of freedoms and opportunities ... you give us ownership of our lives for the first time ... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves : to live by the rules ... rules that are n't made to keep one people subordinate to another , but rules that exist to preserve equality . you aspire to very high ideals here .

it 's like having an eleventh finger removed . it hurts like hell , but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place .

my wife ? she worries about me .

we were chasing you because you ran , you dumb son-of-a-bitch .

so what was that other word for human ... slow ka ?

our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked .

which one is that ? raw what ?

from quarantine , when my people first arrived here . he and i were housed together .

stay back ! i 'm okay .

screw me ? that ca n't be right .

at the end of the bar .

agree to work with me ? you do n't like me ... you do n't like any of us . you have nothing but contempt for us . and yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner ...

why 'd i do what ?

a week ago two men came to see her husband . after they left , he was very frightened . she identified one of the men from a photo i showed her . it was hubley .

did you learn anything ?

why the hell -- ? ! great , fine . you talk to the wife .

should n't we examine their personal effects ?

nothing .

great . well , i 'm sure glad that 's settled , are n't you ?

yes ... no , it is not unreasonable . although i --

yes .

with two bri sabot slugs in the chest .

gesundheit . you do n't mind if i stick to george , do you ?

no ... two .

we think he could ' a been involved , yeah . you know him ?

you think this is the guy who did it ?

try joshua strader , will ya , darlin ' ?

ss'kya'ta ' .

yeah , i 'll bet .

lucky nothing . i had to empty my damn gun into him .

you took this gut out , too , did n't you ?

you are to have nothing to do with the investigation into bill tuggle 's death . you know that . leave that for fedorchuk .

get outta there !

yeah , that 's comforting . mine , too .

of course . right in the trunk of the car .

you got your vest ?

whatever gave you that idea ?

hope their plumbing 's the same .

uh , seems to be in front and behind .

ca n't lock up ...

position ?

ten seconds , people . look sharp !

well , thanks , i --

see you soon .

it 's going to be closer . you better get going .

all right . let 's get on it . what 'll you need ?

i 'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours . the blast radius will be about thirty kilometers . about equal to ten megatons .

which would mean lots of those parasites , right ? one for each person ... over a hundred at least .

you 've been doing your homework . look , they ca n't impound it if they do n't know about it .

what rank ? i believe corporal hicks has authority here .

why not ?

i suggest you study the disks ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you .

yes , and i 've read it . you wake up every night , sheets soaking , the same nightmare over and over ...

yeah , yeah . i saw the commercial .

cancer . hmmmm . they still have n't licked that one . cremated . interred parkside repository , little chute , wisconsin . no children .

amy .

is she ... ?

you 'd drifted right through the core systems . it 's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they ... are you all right ?

shit . apone , collect magazines from everybody . we ca n't have any firing in there .

we 're talking thermonuclear explosion .

dead on all channels .

they 're but off ! do something !

so ? so ?

so ... then the fusion containment shuts down .

so .

gorman ! give it a rest would you .

sir , the cpu is on-line .

what 's the question ?

hudson , sir . he 's hicks .

fuckin ' a !

six meters . five . what the fu --

aye-firmative .

not that tunnel , the other one !

hicks , do n't let him leave .

all right ! she 's alive . i believe it . but we got ta get moving ! now !

no ! no ! she 's alive ! we have to --

locked .

get back here , both of you . fall back to operations .

you know , burke , i do n't know which species is worse . you do n't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage .

what 's this ?

they 'll get us .

but they do n't know that . they 're probably looking for other ways to get in . that 'll take them awhile .

poor bastard .

hey , vasquez ... you ever been mistaken for a man ?

it 's readin ' right . look !

oh , right ! right ! with those things running around . no way .

well then somebody 's just going to have to go out there . take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually .

what about the colony transmitter ? that up-link tower down at the other end . why ca n't we use that ?

think of what ? we 're fucked .

i do n't care how ! think of a way . think of something .

hey ... hey ! look , crowe and dietrich are n't dead , man .

so what do i tell this guy ?

you remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau , out past the ilium range , a couple days ago ?

how long have i been on gateway station ?

come on . crawl faster .

i know , honey . me too .

mommy ... i mean , ripley ... i 'm scared .

why do they tell little kids that ?

i do n't want to ... i have scary dreams .

you promise ?

newt . look at me ... newt . i wo n't leave you . i promise .

what did you say ?

how many colonists ?

thank you , officer ripley . that will be ...

look , i can see where this is going . but i 'm telling you those things exist . back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs . thousands . do you understand ? i suggest you find it , using the flight recorder 's data . find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise ...

then that would be eating and drinking i 'd live like a prince without thinking . the wisdom of old would be mine - a woman 's much better than wine ! then that would be eating and drinking ! the wisdom of old would be mine - a woman 's much better than wine . she 's much better than wine ! she 's much better than wine !

a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno 's wish . a willing , billing , lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish . be my most tasty little dish ! be my most tasty little dish !

indeed .

well , i think that went off remarkably well , do n't you ?

what did you think of the music ?

well , what does it matter to you ?

looks do n't concern me , maestro . only talent interests a woman of taste .

what does he look like ?

what 's that ?

well ? how do you like it ? it 's turkish . my hairdresser tells me everything 's going to be turkish this year !

excuse us , fraulein . good night , signore .

what ? ?

oh - excuse me !

what ?

oh , your grace - i thank your grace ! i thank you !

your son is an unprincipled , spoiled , conceited brat .

oh sir , yes ! he 's about to make the worst mistake of his life . some little viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage . i know my son . he is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him .

if his grace is not satisfied with me , he can dismiss me .

are you drunk ? you invited me . and my horse . here he is . ottavio !

dinner ? how dare you ? i am a nobleman . i only dine with people of my own height .

i feel wrong . i feel wrong being here .

what is it ?

it 's killing me .

i 'm not telling you .

wolfi ! your father is dead .

these gentlemen are from salzburg .

no , it 's right he should hear . i 'm sick to death of it . we ca n't do anything right for you , can we ?

oh , damn !

i do n't know .

what does she want ?

tea ? who wants tea ? let 's go out ! this calls for a feast . you do n't want tea , papa . let 's go dancing . papa loves parties , do n't you ?

he 's not herr mozart . call him papa .

yes !

do n't be stupid .

no , they will not . i know how things work in this city .

one royal pupil and the whole of vienna will come flocking . we 'd be set up for life !

of course .

excuse me , wolfi . mama is not feeling very well . can we leave now ?

just say it - you 'll see . it 's very serious . em iram ! em iram !

oh , ha , ha , ha .

yes ! back ! back ! listen - do n't you know where you are ?

i am ! i am ! i 'm stopping it - slowly . you see ! look , i 've stopped . now we are going back .

he 's not going to work on this anymore . it is making him ill. please .

he needs me , ma'am .

should we stay here ? it 's a charming room . i love these candlesticks . were they here earlier ? i did n't notice them i suppose i was too nervous .

i do apologize for this afternoon . i behaved like a silly girl . where shall we go ?

then do n't . it 's up to you . not to be vague , that is the price .

but ! i 'm a married woman !

come back tonight .

oh , thank you , sir !

thank you very much , your excellency .

sir , we really need this job . we 're desperate . my husband spends far more than he can ever earn . i do n't mean he 's lazy - he 's not at all - he works all day long . it 's just ! he 's not practical . money simply slips through his fingers , it 's really ridiculous , your excellency . i know you help musicians . you 're famous for it . give him just this one post . we 'd be forever indebted !

no , sir . this is my own idea .

i will look at them , of course , the moment i can . it will be an honour . please give him my warmest .

i understand .

how charming . but why did he not come himself ?

frau mozart ?

excellency !

you know what 's ridiculous ? your libretto , that 's what 's ridiculous . only an idiot would ask wolfi to work on that stuff !

i 'm paying people just to wait for you . it 's ridiculous !

he 's doing his best .

i 'm paying these people . do you realize that ?

he 's not in . but he 's working on it . he said to tell you .

how much will you pay him ?

do you hear him ? do you ?

so you are ! the place is a pigsty all the time .

but you ca n't take her without reference . it 's unheard of !

in three months ! papa .

when , may i ask ?

be careful !

i am sorry , madame , but no ! i can not let anyone pass .

do you know who i am ? this is my daughter . i am frau weber . we are favoured guests !

i am sorry , madame . it is not permitted .

let us pass , please ! let us pass at once ! we 're with the emperor .

people who know say the girl 's got talent . you must judge for yourself . if you think she stinks , say so .

upstairs .

who was your teacher ?

as a matter of fact , one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well !

why not ?

well . there it is .

you please me , court composer . a very clever idea .

your highness .

good morning , court composer . this is my niece , the princess elizabeth .

excuse me , sire , but what do you think these could be ? being a foreigner , i would love to learn .

well , i 'm glad to hear that .

well , there it is . now to business . young man , we are going to commission an opera from you . what do you say ?

let 's have some fun . bring in herr mozart , please . but slowly , slowly . i need a minute to practice .

you do me too much honour , sire .

you are passionate , mozart ! but you do not persuade .

twenty , sire ! how about twenty ? twenty minutes of continuous music . no recitatives .

i think you are rather innocent , my friend . in these dangerous times i can not afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece .

sire , i swear to your majesty , there 's nothing like that in the story . i have taken out everything that could give offense . i hate politics .

well , yes , i admit it is .

ah ! by all means .

may i introduce my father ? he is on a short visit here and returning very soon to salzburg . he would so much like to kiss your hand . it would make his whole stay so memorable for him .

bravo , mozart . most charming . yes , indeed . clever man .

excuse me , but how old are you ?

really ? how delightful . may i ask when you marry ?

my dear , young man , do n't take it too hard . your work is ingenious . it 's quality work . and there are simply too many notes , that 's all . cut a few and it will be perfect .

i do n't understand . there are just as many notes , majesty , as are required . neither more nor less .

i think so , sire , yes .

ah-ha .

majesty !

oh , thank you .

your majesty , herr mozart -

father -

do n't worry , i 'm not staying here to be a burden .

oh , let 's not talk about it .

i do n't know . it 's not important . i mean , i do n't want pupils . they get in the way . i 've got to have time for composition .

that 's not what i hear .

how is your financial situation ?

oh , yes . oh , i mean no - not exactly like this . i mean today - just today , stanzi - i remember now . she had to go - yes ! she had to help her mother . yes , she 's like that . her mother 's a very sweet woman , you 'll see .

i 'm frightened , sir . really ! when he speaks , he does n't make any sense . you know he said he saw - he said he saw his father . and his father 's dead .

here , in his stomach . they bend him right over .

where ?

oh , i would n't know that , sir .

yes , thank you , sir .

yes . i can live in or out just as you wish .

that 's right .

so let me see it . where is it ?

look , i asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes .

why not ?

yes .

that kind of music should be punishable by death .

papa , the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room .

what did he say ? what did he say ?

sssh ! stay here .

my answer is no , mozart .

what for ?

well . since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services , could you favour me with a little money instead ?

it 's a miracle , herr mozart !

strudel , this is herr mozart . say good morning .

quiet ! quiet ! quiet ! down there , damn you . welcome to you . pay no attention , they 're impossible . stop it , you willful things ! come this way . just ignore them . they 're perfectly harmless , just willful . i treat them just like my own children .

i was foolish . i thought you did not care for my work - or me . forgive me . forgive me !

what for ?

would you stay with me while i sleep a little ?

i can keep going , i assure you . shall we try ?

oh no . i 'm not tired at all .

i think so .

oh no . now for the fire . strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this .

also identical ?

now the orchestra . second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses . identical notes and rhythm . the first bassoon and tenor trombone -

the fire .

so now - a minor . suddenly .

we ended in f major ?

my dear friend , it would be my greatest pleasure .

would you ? actually , you could .

yes . can i - could i help you , in any way ?

another ? but that 's too soon ! tomorrow night ? it 's impossible ! did he say a hundred ?

who ?

shall i answer it ?

what ?

i do .

do you mean that ?

you 're so good to me . truly . thank you .

what happened ? is it over ?

i am only a messenger . do you accept ? you will be paid well .

a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one .

what dead ? who is dead ?

how could it not , excellency ?

how could i not ?

grazie , mio caro , wolfgang !

i would n't presume . all the same , if it would n't be imposing , i would like you to see my new piece . it would be a tremendous honour for me .

i know , i know . perhaps you should give me some lessons in that .

i know ; it 's outrageous . still , if the public does n't like one 's work one has to accept the fact gracefully .

what exactly are you working on ?

i 'm afraid not .

do you have a daughter ?

of course not .

no , but i 'm broke . i 'm always broke . i do n't know why .

look , i must have pupils . without pupils i ca n't manage .

why ? here is the music . it 's here . i am submitting it humbly . is n't that what you wanted ?

so you see , this post is very important to me right now .

dear mozart , my sincere congratulations .

but this is absurd !

yes ! yes ! er , on the whole , yes , majesty .

oh yes , certainly . certainly , herr director !

just let me tell you how it begins .

that will do , herr mozart !

mozart , you are not the only composer in vienna .

elevated ? what does that mean ? elevated ! the only thing a man should elevate is - oh , excuse me . i 'm sorry . i 'm stupid . but i am fed up to the teeth with elevated things ! old dead legends ! how can we go on forever writing about gods and legends ?

well done , mozart . really quite fine .

no , father . from now on no one will be able to speak of mozart without thinking of me . whenever they say mozart with love , they 'll have to say salieri with loathing . and that 's my immortality - at last ! our names will be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy . at least it 's better than the total oblivion he 'd planned for me , your merciful god !

no , you did n't !

his funeral - imagine it ! the cathedral , all vienna sitting there . his coffin , mozart 's little coffin in the middle . and suddenly in that silence , music . a divine music bursts out over them all , a great mass of death : requiem mass for wolfgang mozart , composed by his devoted friend antonio salieri . what sublimity ! what depth ! what passion in the music ! salieri has been touched by god at last . and god , forced to listen . powerless - powerless to stop it . i at the end , for once , laughing at him . do you understand ? do you ?

i do not claim to unravel the mysteries . i treasure them . as you should .

oh ? i thought you did so every day . so speak now . answer me !

my son , no one can speak for god .

every day . sometimes for hours i would pray !

do you hear me ?

well ?

i do not seek forgiveness .

are they ?

i can not leave alone a soul in pain .

you tried to take your life . you do remember that , do n't you ?

what anger ?

well , the play makes a hero out of a valet . he outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher . do you see the implications ? this would be , in a grander situation , as if a chamberlain were to expose an emperor .

did we ?

well done , sire !

i ca n't wait .

now you 've got to promise me faithfully you 'll remain true to me forever . then you 'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you .

no , baron , no . i 'm afraid mozart is a lost cause . he has managed to alienate practically the whole of vienna . he is constantly drunk . he never pays his debts . i ca n't think of one person to whom i dare recommend him .

ca n't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him ? i 've done my best . i got him to arrange some bach for my sunday concerts . he got a fee - what i could afford . ca n't you think of anyone who might do something for him ?

this is embarrassing , you know . you introduced mozart to some of my friends and he 's begging from practically all of them . it has to stop .

come with me . and stay in the room .

he did n't say , sir . i told him i did n't know when you would be back , but he insisted on waiting .

bene .

of course .

herr salieri .

yes , doctor .

could you get here without any trouble ?

is david acting strangely ?

yes , he is . he 's very excited and confused , but he 's not crazy , if that 's what you mean .

he does n't remember . he woke up at the zoo .

he 's here .

i tried to investigate the attack . there are no records . the case was closed and now they 've 'misplaced ' the file . david 's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before i did . the goodman boy is already in the ground so he 's no good to us . so i went to the pub in east proctor where i was convinced of two things .

warn him ?

yes .

it 's a full moon . where is he ?

come to my office , miss price .

did he say a wolf ?

the police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them . he must have been a very powerful man . although i really do n't see that it is any of your concern , miss price .

what exactly did he call out ?

yes , doctor ?

miss gallagher , surely you must perform some function here at the hospital .

david , do n't lose control .

we had an argument . he 's being silly .

rational ! ? ! i 'm a fucking werewolf , for christ 's sake !

david , stop !

six people mutilated ? it had to be me , alex .

pull over .

i should be committed .

a doper werewolf .

that 's good , alex . reassure me .

david , you do n't honestly believe that in reality your friend jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you ? do you really ?

alex ?

lovely .

i would think so .

i was dreaming again ?

i 'll let you know the next full moon .

are you better now ?

yes , go on .

a connecticut yankee in king arthur 's court by samuel l. clemens . this is after the preface but before chapter one : a word of explanation . you all right ?

my best friend . my very best friend .

this is absurd . i 'm not hungry . i do n't want any food .

aw come on , alex !

well , you 're to take these after you 've eaten . now what kind of nurse would i be if i failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills ?

how is that ?

you have n't eaten your lunch .

i beg your pardon ?

right .

no .

no .

hello , benjamin .

why on earth do you say that ?

he 's an american , you know . dr. hirsch is going to fetch round one of those embassy fellows to see him .

has he been refusing food ?

take these round now , will you please ? the american boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he 's eaten . will you be sure of that ?

yes , mrs. hobbs .

you 're going to have to stop this disturbance or i shall arrest you .

no , david . harry and i and everyone you murder are not dead . the undead .

you 've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless . and i understand that i am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf 's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted .

david , please . the police are satisfied . i 'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern england we 'd have seen it on the telly .

i 've told you , it was n't a man . it was an animal . a big wolf or something . a rabid dog .

doctor , my memory is fine . it 's my sanity i 'm beginning to worry about .

two weeks ?

i should think so after your recent traumatic experiences .

you 're in a hospital in london .

i could hang myself .

how shall i do it ?

because this must be stopped .

if i was still alive , i probably would .

jack , are you really dead ?

you must take your own life now , david , before it 's too late .

if you love me so much , jack , you 'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one 's breakfast with the living dead !

rudy levine the shmuck ?

yeah . your parents came to my funeral . i was surprised at how many people came .

i 'm sorry to be upsetting you , david , but i had to come .

get the fuck out of here , jack .

nice to see you .

well . i 'm glad we ... whoaa ! !

see anything ?

walk away , jack .

do you think it 's a dog ?

anywhere ! i think we should just keep moving .

no , but he was on the moors .

the hound of the baskervilles .

could be a lot of things .

what was it ?

what do you think was wrong ?

i do n't know . now that we 're out here and it 's three degrees , i 'm not so sure i would n't rather face a blood-thirsty mob .

what the hell was that all about ?

you ask them .

go on , ask them .

right .

you ask them .

maybe the owners are from texas .

i assume full responsibility .

if you do n't stop , i 'm going to kill you .

you 're talking about the woman i love .

do you think she 'll meet me in rome ?

jack .

what can we do to assist you ?

i suppose guinness will suffice .

sorry , love .

no .

has mr. kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors ?

she 's a widow . i do n't like taking mortgages from widows .

i 'll tell you why . i do n't like the crowd you 're mixed up with . personally , you can have all the credit you want . but for that deal - not a cent .

i 'm fourteen cents out , and it took me half an hour to find the mistake . and me with a date , too .

what 's the matter , charlie ?

it 'll be yours if you do n't kick in with that ten bucks .

it was more than that last week .

how much ?

take it easy , clark .

what good will that do ? why , it will take control away from him . we 'll put somebody else in charge , call in all doubtful loans , and be on safe ground again . that 's what good it will do !

so , that 's it , eh ? you 've waited a long time for this chance , have n't you ? well , i 'm not going to resign now - or ever .

no . you ca n't reason with anyone else when you 're in a jam . we pleaded with you to keep liquid , but you would n't listen to us . you preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish . now you want our help . you want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you 've wrecked . all right . there 's one way you can get it . give us an option on your stock and resign as president .

i know that among you , you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city . get that money over here and i 'll stop this run within five minutes .

we want to talk to you .

just pure luck !

what 's the matter with my policy ? how many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years ? i 'll tell you . not a single one ! what 's wrong with that kind of banking ?

oh , you would , eh ? all right . if it 's more important than golf , go ahead . what 's on your mind ?

claims he was there with a married woman . does n't want to mention her name .

stand back , inspector . let me out of here , or i 'll shoot you !

somebody must be in good humor . he was humming `` mother machree . ''

why , of course .

you understand ?

oh yes , of course . there was someone with me . a lady .

she just came up for a drink . just for a few minutes .

what was my wife doing in your apartment last night ?

what happened ? you 're not a thief . how 'd you get mixed up with these kind of people ?

why , i could n't do that . . . !

good heavens , man ! you 're not suggesting that i

that do n't do us any good .

a misunderstood bachelor .

what is that , mr . bones ? [ 7 ]

no . i know the answer to that one . i think you 'd better take me home .

i knew i could n't trust you . you told me you were taking me home .

do n't you know ?

well , are n't you going to invite me ?

but i 'm giving a party for him - a real , old-fashioned surprise party . caps , bells , whistles , and everything . i 'm really terribly excited about it . i 've been planning it for months .

but you see , it is n't blarney where you 're concerned .

what is ?

am i ? why , i - i do n't know any reason why i should be , unless of course it 's you . . .

what is the matter with you ? you 're trembling ?

phyllis , you do n't have to explain anything . you 'd do well to mind your own business .

i tell you , i 'm not interested in your opinion .

it 's funny - now that i 'm here , i do n't know just how to go about it . you see , i kind of expected to find you here alone .

i 'm listening .

well , i thought i 'd like to have a little talk with you .

are the payrolls ready for tomorrow ?

got a handkerchief ?

john , how 's your wife this morning ?

in cluett 's apartment ? well dear , you see , i . . . i . . .

last night ? er - why - uh , last night . . .

the girls ! i do n't suppose it ever occurred to you that i might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .

listen , it is n't so terribly important . we can go to the theatre any time .

i do n't care whether it 's important or not . you said you were going out with me , and if you had n't promised so faithfully , i would n't have gone and planned the whole thing .

yes .

it 's amazing that your sweet , lovely , gorgeous wife can ever get to see you .

numbers ? no , never mind .

helen , tell matt i want to see him .

directors , eh ? long faces ?

get mrs. dickson on the phone .

mr. sampson . . .

mr. schaffer will take good care of you . he 'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .

but , mr. dickson , i thought you were going to take care of the mortgage . i only want ten thousand . the property is worth sixty .

hello , helen .

got my letter ?

i do n't know . mr. sampson bought it for me .

no , sir .

gee , thanks , mr. dickson

well . . . uh . . . i . . .

wait a minute . answer my question . was mrs. dickson there ?

was mrs. dickson there ?

oh , i can explain about that later . you 're losing your bank - do n't you realize what that means ?

no . i wo n't .

i already told him i was home .

aw , go on , forget it . you came through , did n't you ? that 's all i wanted . a lot of them did n't think you would . you do n't know how much satisfaction it 's been to me . it 's been swell . well , when are you and helen going to get married ?

aw , i 'm sorry , mr. dickson . it 's just kind of sudden , that 's all . sure , i 'm excited . i think it 's great . only , well , you 've done so much for me already . . . i 'll never be able to thank you enough .

say , come on . show a little enthusiasm . what 's the matter ? are you sick or something ? go on , fake it - even if it is n't real .

sure , i think it 's swell .

what 's the matter ? you do n't seem very excited about it .

and what 's more , keep up the good work and who knows - some day you 'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . . not a bad thought , eh ?

you 're lying !

no wonder he did n't want to mention her name .

my wife ? what 's she got to do with you ?

he 's just confessed . he 's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town .

all i know is the bank 's been robbed and a murder 's been committed . the way i see it , brown here looks guilty .

why pick on him ?

do n't you think i know it ?

yes , sir . but soon as our money runs out , they 'll mob the place .

yes , sir .

the lobby 's half filled now .

yes , sir .

he says he ca n't get away in the daytime .

hardly .

well , take my word for it , and do n't try it . it 's useless ! if it were some other woman , i could handle her , but after all , you ca n't scratch a bank 's eyes out now , can you ?

no .

helen , did you ever try competing with a bank ?

the big guys have got the screws on him . you 've got to come through for him , mr. conway . he came through for you a hundred times . if his friends do n't help him , who is going to help him ?

mr. williams . . .

sure , they 'd turn him down . he ought to know that . i 'm going in there and talk to him .

what 's he doing , honey ? is he getting any help ?

okay , honey - but just the same i 'd like to take a crack at that

now you 've got me worried , dear . promise me you wo n't butt in .

oh now , do n't be silly .

yes , right in his office , the rat . i 'd like to take a crack at that guy .

in cluett 's office ?

i tell you , i saw them !

say , i just heard the merger is n't going thru . is n't that grand ?

oh , ten dollars

the ten dollars .

with what ?

yes , sir .

are you sure ?

he was in the bank yesterday .

yes , sir .

i 've been trailing the cashier like you told me . you 're right about that guy , chief . there 's something screwy somewhere .

no - because me clock struck four , and when it strikes four , it 's one .

yes , i know . cause the dooley sisters were n't in yet .

it could n't have been earlier ?

i do n't care about the dooley sisters - what time did he get in ?

now , let me see - a half hour after the dooley sisters - and the dooley sisters never get home until after

what time was it ?

sure i do . he has the best room in me house . the one with the fancy wallpaper .

do you know this young man , mrs. halligan ?

then where were you ?

eleven o'clock , eh ? are you sure it was that ?

so you were home last night ?

i did n't do it ! i have n't got a gun !

everybody in ?

you 've got enough ?

i 'm okay , matt .

how are you fixed ?

now you tell us .

sometimes a wound will kill .

this is healing ?

you can ride like that ?

he 's not bad at it .

things changed when you quit the gang . for example , i 'm now the one who says `` let 's ride . ''

i 'm sorry , cole .

what have you done ?

that 's what the newspapers say . were n't for jesse james , this gang would n't be able to find a goat 's ass with a stick .

how ?

no , jimmy has a point . the younger-james gang could be confusing .

you stay out of this , bob .

uhh , yeah it does .

better pass them over here before something happens to 'em .

dammit , this stopped being fun about two years ago !

the army can hang him .

jesus mercy , that 's charlie higgins , dave laller ...

then i love it .

corn gon na shoot at me ?

okay , folks , i think we know how this is going to go ...

best damn plan i heard all war .

how ?

what ?

we did n't . zerelda did . turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw .

bob , rip up some bandages .

clell , tom , go get doc mimms in liberty !

i 'm the better soldier , jesse .

that 's it .

a bad idea .

beautiful .

i 've robbed just as many banks as you have ! i know this town , and i know this bank , and i say it 's an easy job .

hold on , hold on , we all know bob is an important part of the gang .

all the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the `` james-younger gang . ''

sure , cousin .

twenty ? !

it 's not a bank .

see , frank 's being smart about this .

sorry .

the james-younger gang .

because we were good at it ? hell , we were great at it . jesse , do n't tell anyone i said this , because everybody knows i 'm the toughest man in this town , but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns .

she was european !

you 're not scared , are you ?

i 'm thinking ...

they 're just insurance in case we run .

another dozen out back .

-- exactly . because this is a war .

get buckets !

bastards ! come back here and face me !

which one , right or left ?

cannon or gatling ?

the safe . now .

east ? east above the river heading for the eagle pass ?

the district marshall

then why ca n't i go in there ?

web died fighting ?

well , i hope the boy pulls through . we should know in the morning .

i fooled them into thinking i was alone .

they 're gone . what are you --

i 'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time .

railroad burned him out too . you could n't have stopped him .

bob here 'll kill a man for sneezing , and he 's the best shot in the gang .

we 're gon na have to talk ...

ma .

would you get in the carriage ? until ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself , she 's gon na make me miserable .

i swear i 'll shoot you in your sleep .

saved all our lives , doc . none of the liberty boys would have come home if not for web mimms , doc . god 's honest truth .

we better go to doc 's , see what 's going on here .

looks like web mimms was n't the only casualty this town 's got .

all this time in the saddle ... we get to the farm , i 'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle .

pff . they hardly even noticed you .

distracting enough for you ?

every time i put my head up to hit that gatling , they try to shoot it off .

everything but the boring parts .

uncle frank ?

but he killed a lot of men , too .

saved a lot of folk from the railroad .

allow a man his version of the past . when you get to be my age , you 've got enough painful memories , you 're allowed to soften a few of the edges up .

... every time you tell that story , you stop there . that 's not how it ended . i was five when my dad got shot .

y'know , uncle frank ...

take care of each other , boys . you say your prayers .

we know , ma . now we got to get you to doc mimms .

ma , i 'm glad to see you being nice to our injun friend .

tennessee ?

do n't swear .

stop it . this is just sad .

aw , shucks , ma'am ...

jesse , have you ever noticed that when you 're trying to charm your way out of trouble , your accent gets all farm boy ?

`` but the life of the james gang was n't all robbing and shooting and killing , for these young missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies ... especially the handsome and charismatic jesse james . ''

i would never have imagined us in a place like this .

that 's ... wonderful . it 's just ... i thought ...

i had to see you . i 'm getting married .

let the law --

i am so sorry , jesse .

were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting ?

little ones .

not if i find the right girl .

arr . hand over your jewels , missy .

unfair . you are completely unfair .

i should n't tease a hero .

nuh-huh ...

but you got big !

zerelda ? little zee mimms ?

fair enough .

he 's too important , james . they 'll set the army on you . you and your wife .

no , i 'll hang you . but i may miss you just a bit .

you almost ended my career before it began .

now let 's have a drink .

thank you .

the lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable . `` jesse woodson james . '' jesse james ? the jesse james ?

this is unusual . most of our marriages are members of the congregation .

this time we 'll make an exception .

no .

i 'm the same age you were when you went off to war .

do n't talk about it much , though .

that is so gentlemanly of you .

why do n't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk ?

not at all .

really ?

oh , you were talking to jesse .

relax , alan . the army has this all in hand . and mr. thaddeus rains will be very pleased with this news . nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate .

not such a menace now , is he , pinkerton ?

i remember you .

that .

i look forward to seeing it .

we did .

they exchanged fire with the pinkerton guards , killing several of them . then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile .

parker , tell me what 's going on so i can return as quickly as possible to boston and my whores and cigars , not necessarily in that order .

and it is my pleasure to be here .

why , their intense hatred of you , of course .

no .

it 's going to be a long spring .

i demand action .

pinkerton . it 's been eight months . i see robberies . i see hold ups . but i do not see men on the end of nooses .

it 's going to be a long winter .

`` a rock island and pacific railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside st. louis , missouri . the brave and daring james-younger gang was heavily outnumbered by pinkerton detectives , but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the west . ''

this is no game .

oh no , i would have done that . but i would have made sure i killed them , too .

you would n't have done that ?

look at this , pinkerton ! they got the payroll , and this damage will set construction back two months at least .

yes , courtney ?

what are you doing tonight ?

oh god , just get it over with .

oh christ , this really is n't worth it . and see , courtney , it 's there for what ? huh ? tell us . why is it pulled down half an inch ? so it can catch the force of the ejaculate !

because you have to leave half an inch at the tip to catch the force of the ejaculate ! bateman i 'm getting out of here . where 's your lithium ?

why ?

oh jesus . i 'm going home .

i 'm ignoring you .

j & b . straight .

you know , courtney , you should take some more lithium . or have a diet coke . some caffeine might get you out of this slump .

is that donald trump 's car ?

sounds like i 'll have to . do n't fall asleep , okay ? wear something fabulous . dorsia , remember ?

nice ?

i ca n't .

so , you 're looking great , how have you been ?

you have a really nice place here ... paul . how much did you pay for it ?

i have n't seen you around here .

if you really want to do something for me , you can stop making this scene right now .

but what about the past ? our past ?

but your friends are my friends . my friends are your friends . i do n't think it would work . you have a little something on your upper lip .

it 's over , evelyn . it 's all over

why ? what 's wrong ?

your hairline looks like it 's receding .

why don t you just go for price ?

do you know what ed gein said about women ?

what are the rules for a sweater vest ?

do n't make any trouble . please . i suggest you go .

but i think ... i want to know what happened here .

you saw the ad in the times ?

does n't he live here ?

now , if you 'll excuse me .

bateman killing owen and the escort girls ? oh that s fabulous . that 's rich ...

jesus , davis . yes . that was hilarious . that was you , was n't it ?

face it-the japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s .

what ? carruthers i 'll call you .

where are you going ?

jesus lives , luis .

where to ? morgan stanley ? rehab ? what ?

where to ? are you going to go get a gram ?

maybe it 's just the light .

your friend has already been seated . follow me , mr. halberstam .

oh god , what did you say , you dumb bitch ?

hello ? jean , i need help !

patrick bateman 's office .

i know i should go . i know i have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men , and ... i mean , do you want me to go ?

sorry .

patrick , have you ever wanted to make someone happy ?

oh . uh , tape . duct tape . i ... need it for ... taping something . bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun .

are you seeing anyone ? i mean , seriously ?

and do n't tell me you enjoy working with children , okay ?

no . it 's all right . i 'm not very good at controlling it anyway .

you can always he thinner . look ... better .

want a bite ?

dorsia is ... fine .

soooo ... dorsia is where jean wants to go ...

let 's not think about what i want . how about anywhere you want .

that is ... if you 're not doing anything .

is that the ransom file ? thanks . do n't wear that outfit again .

yes ?

i 'll do it .

no , silly . forget it . i 'll make them . thanks .

oh , something . . romantic ?

yes , sir .

just say no ?

negative . cancel it .

i occasionally box with ricky at the harvard club . anyone else ?

aerobics class . sorry . any messages ?

late ?

you think i 'm dumb . you think all models are dumb .

so , what do you do ?

yeah .

listen , if you could talk to them i would really appreciate it . i 'm really late . i have a lunch appointment at hubert 's in fifteen minutes .

does he do this all the time ?

patrick , you re a lunatic .

what do you mean , she was a hot number .

so who was he with ?

he was n't with paul owen .

oh . kimball now where were you ?

i think maybe you 've got your dates mixed up .

yes , of course . the hash browns are delicious . i 'm just ... not ... ordering them .

not in the mood , i guess .

well , to each his own . so-lunch , thursday ? i 'll call your secretary about reservations .

no , i like music . just-they're-huey 's too ... black sounding . for me .

great , yes , i 'd like that .

listen , i 'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when i 've sorted out all this information ?

patrick , please . i hope i 've been informative . long day-a bit scattered .

well , i could he wrong .

god ... i guess ... i was probably returning videotapes .

dan , great to see you again . like i said , you need anything at all , i 'm your man . i do n't envy your job . i mean owen was a ... complex man .

oh really ? i did n't know that .

the earth just opens up and swallows people .

no , not yet . as i said , we 're not sure . but ... basically no one has seen or heard anything .

had his apartment been burglarized ?

have you consulted a psychic ?

what ?

well , maybe he did , huh ?

yeah . you know ... hang out .

do you feel that way ?

he led what i suppose was an orderly life . he ... ate a balanced diet .

yeah ... yale thing .

how well did you know him ?

well ...

what can you tell me about paul owen ?

who do you ask ?

nice . very nice .

no , really . i 'm okay .

understandable . lime ?

the disappearance of paul owen .

so it 's nothing that official . i just have some basic questions . about paul owen . about yourself-

why do n't you get another one ? why do n't , you get another job ?

i 'm so hungry .

i 'm so hungry .

no , man . i 'm gon na bail .

another martini , paul ?

cecelia is , well ... you know

we should 've gone to dorsia . i could 've gotten us a table .

listen , the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here .

really ? that 's interesting . not great ?

how 's the ransom account going , marcus ?

hello , halberstam . nice tie . how the hell are you ?

you know what he 's like . he just wants to work on stuff that 's cool .

you know what i mean .

' gon na wait outside .

... wan na savor this .

here we go .

do n't we have any chopsticks ?

yeah ? give me a goodbye kiss .

look at me ! i 'm gon na change .

just shut up ?

i went to see the skywire model in gary 's office . you know . just to hold it again .

milo , you --

what ?

after i broke into 21 -- which was insane , thank god they did n't catch me ! -- i just drove around . trying to figure out what possessed me . you know what ? i 've been putting my own guilt on gary .

the justice department guy who came to the apartment when --

it 's almost nine , i 've been so worried ! what did you see in there ?

milo , you told me those doj agents are all over the place . how could they hope to hide a surveillance post ? and how can you get in there , anyway ? with the cameras and the swipe cards --

how should i know ? `` solving a problem , '' i guess . or needing to control everything . i do n't know . i 've got ta get in there .

you 're scaring me . i think we should just go .

they hack into people 's programs ?

what 're you -- what ?

teddy was killed last night .

what 's extreme is what that er doctor said when he pumped your stomach . eat another sesame seed and that 's it .

you know he 's never been anybody 's counselor before ?

c'mon , i would n't have a destiny without you . my destiny would be dying at 20. from eating --

i forgot . that 's why you have to help me decide .

did n't you visit the campus ?

but he 's not quite the same guy anymore . do n't get your hopes too high ?

it 's important .

i think i kind of lost it . i was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest , most powerful ... 'did n't know i even cared about that stuff .

he said it made sense that gary 's code was like teddy 's , that that clich about great minds was true . said it was all about his own guilt . plus , he has a tendency to get gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while . it always passes .

no .

yes sir .

i -- just wan na help bring these guys to justice . they 're neo-nazis .

it was racially motivated . he 's chinese . he was . and ... i know sometimes the fbi gets involved with that . do n't they ?

milo ?

... it 's -- milo , is n't it ?

great . great ! we need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --

brian ! you wan na be a big deal , do n't you ? that 's your dream in life .

we tried !

milo . surprised he 's not your guest .

there 's no hard evidence he knew about this . anybody who could implicate him seems to 've vanished .

outpost does n't own em .

that 's got ta kill him , right ?

'could n't convince teddy to come ?

milo ? i 'm danny .

i do know . you focus on the big problem . but somewhere down the chain , something breaks down . something gets destroyed . at first it 's upsetting . you feel you 've lost control .

do n't be so hard on yourself . with a brain like yours , you could connive with the best of 'em i bet .

... my dad was a compulsive gambler . only he did n't think he was . that applied to guys who did n't have a `` system . '' `` losers , '' who played games of chance . he could `` read '' people , so chance had nothing to do with it . no matter how deep a hole he dug himself , he 'd give you the whole speech . and you 'd better not point out the obvious . his creditors would catch up to him . loan sharks or whatever . he 'd wake us in the middle of the night . off we 'd go , again .

it helps . alice said it would help . to focus on something . 'do n't know what i 'd do without her .

i heard what happened .

it 's okay . really .

too fast ? at least four companies 're on the verge of workable convergence systems , milo , they --

... do i ?

i do !

i 've only shown this to three other people . i bought 200 , we 've launched 12 so far . i keep the coordinates in this room . it 's left over from sdi . reagan 's star wars technology ? they orbit 426 miles up .

oh . no thanks .

you would ? wow . when would we come ? 'think he hung up .

what ?

ready for number three ?

okay , # 2 .

what 'd the girl say ?

cool .

those really weird , short lines .

man , could he write code . totally elegant . he had his own style .

you are naive . look at your employment contract : you ca n't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years . not that i do n't miss you .

i know you lost all his work . maybe i could come down here and --

you do ?

you calling phil and randy ?

latitude 47 degrees .

at this point the worst thing i could do is anything out of the ordinary .

please do n't go .

you could always say you have to go the bathroom .

oh .

they know i broke in . alice helped me . shrot 's not one of them . he 's blundering into this on his own .

'think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are ?

oh . i liked you . i was checking you out .

he 's got 12 satellites up . he 's got dishes on top of 21. he 's building this -- mega-network for skywire . let 's use it .

what about the fbi ?

no , no . never .

they 'd frame him .

i know why you 're so secretive . why you wo n't let anybody near you . i know what he did to you .

it 's easy to know who the smart geeks are , the schools tell 'em . they upload medical files , school records , pharmacy files . they 'd be happy just to steal code forever . but when a program gets close to fruition . like teddy . he was almost there .

mmm-more like -- i have a little trouble . trusting people .

no . please .

show me .

did n't mean to pry . i just have this theory . some of us who got to good at this ? we were -- escaping something .

me too ! were you an army brat or something ?

i would n't worry about it . you 've got ta figure most people around here were their teachers ' pets .

a beautiful geek ? i do n't wan na sound paranoid , or like a pig , but what 're the chances ?

i do n't know .

what ? come on . is it serious ?

what ? !

outpost made me sign 1,000 . 'guess we 'll find out what else we have to talk about . life stuff .

hey , we got seed money for the startup ! a million-five !

is that how larry feels ?

what 're they building ?

she 's a programmer ?

did you download corey ? in san jose ?

can we buy into their ipo ? or is that a justice dept . problem ?

we tried the big vaporware number , gary , it 's no-sale .

we 're too late . take a look .

unless it 's a diversion . milo 's in my office . he was tailgating , so i --

oh , you 're very clever . let 's make love , you silly , hairy little man .

i 'll tell you all in due time , after we make love . but first , tell me another poem .

do you mind if i ask you a personal question ?

kiss me .

'milk , milk , lemonade . round the corner fudge is made . stick your finger in the hole , and out comes a tootsie roll ! '

groovy .

call me ritchie , miss fagina . may i call you alotta ... please ?

`` fifteen minutes of fame ? '' i 'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that , either .

be careful !

but , wait , i -- you got me again . oh , and austin --

thanks , basil . maybe the nineties are n't so bad after all .

here 's the number of my dentist , he 's first rate . ring him up , he 'll look after you .

not quite , actually . vanessa , i have something for you .

all right , austin , i think you should go .

i 'm sorry , basil , i thought she was a man .

thank you .

yes ?

then you 'll have to go it alone . good luck .

be careful .

yes ?

oh , and austin ...

thank you , exposition .

my god , vanessa 's got a smashing body . i bet she shags like a minx . how do i tell them that because of the unfreezing process , i have no inner monologue ? i hope i did n't say that out loud just now .

vanessa 's one of our top agents .

you mean mrs. kensington ?

when do i begin ?

yes , i 'm having trouble controlling ... the volume of my voice !

thank you .

just where you 'd never think to look for him . we 'll be there .

groovy !

good afternoon , mr. powers , i 'm the destructacon 5000. i 'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point . you might as well surrender . resistance is futile . your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to ...

not really . kill the little bastard . see what i care .

really , there 's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster .

i 've got you , dr. evil !

what 's wrong with your hand ?

kiss me .

hold on a tick , let me put on my togs .

it 's not what it looks like , vanessa . at ease , boys .

listen , vanessa , whatever happens , i just want you to know that i feel bad about shagging that italian girl . i had a sip of sake and all of the sudden , i do n't know what happened . the whole time i was shagging her -- i mean really shagging her , i mean it was crazy , i was like a huge mechanical piston , in and out , in and out ! --

too right , youth . that 's why i need you to lead the troops .

that 's not the way to get ahead in life .

smashing idea ! give it to me .

no , no , no . we 'll use the floss to get to the ledge .

sadly , no . hold on ! i always keep this on me just in case .

do you think she 's prettier than i ?

since i 've been unfrozen , i 've had a rancid taste in my mouth . do you have a piece of gum ?

basil was very concerned to know where you were last night .

hello , luv .

it was just a shag , vanessa . you 're everything to me .

i ca n't believe you made love to her just like that . did you use protection ?

do n't be sorry . you 're right to be suspicious . i shagged her . i shagged her rotten .

of course , luv .

oh , yes you are .

always wanting to have fun , that 's you in a nutshell .

i have n't had fun like that since college .

you 're crazy . the camera loves you , vanessa .

he 's too well-protected right now .

let 's go get him !

good morning , vanessa ! i hope you have on clean underwear .

here , use mine .

i love las vegas , man . oh , i forgot my x-ray glasses .

i hope this is part of the unfreezing process .

what ?

sure .

brrrr ! she must be frigid . there 's two things i know about life : one , americans will never take to soccer . two , swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag ! they 're shag-mad , man ! let me ask you a question , vanessa , and be honest .

a chigro ?

i 'm sorry ?

i 've been frozen for thirty years , man , i want to see if my bits and pieces are still working .

i beg your pardon ?

one book : swedish-made penis enlarger pumps and me : this sort of thing is my bag , baby , by austin powers .

danger 's my middle name .

no , no , i want you to have it , even if it 's my last piece .

hey ! wait a minute , that 's my last piece of gum .

here , have a piece of gum .

hey , wait a minute --

hi , folks . you 're entering a restricted zone . can i see your security badges ?

what 's its current position ?

shut up .

in many ways , bob 's big boy never left , sir . he 's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices .

it appears to be in the shape of bob 's big boy , sir .

you 've all been gathered here to form my evil cabinet . excuse me .

we 've got a lot of work to do .

i have one simple request -- sharks with friggin ' laser beams attached to their heads , and it ca n't be done ? remind me again why i pay you people ? what do we have ?

what is it now ?

right . mr. powers , we 're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads .

it 's about the sharks . since you were frozen , they 've been placed on the endangered species list . we tried to get some , but it will take months to clear up the red tape .

dr. evil ?

yes . scott !

yes .

no , the boy 's right . i really am evil .

scott , do n't say that ...

what did you say ?

do n't you want to see what daddy does for a living ?

no , scott . you just do n't get it , do you ?

fine . whatever . mutated , ill-tempered sea bass it is . come , let 's return to dinner . close the tank .

why are you feeding him ? why do n't you just kill him ?

and that 's how you want to live your life , is it ?

fascinating . what are your plans for this evening ?

but scott , who 's going to take over the world when i die ?

hello , scott . i 'm your father , dr. evil . i have a son ! i have a son ! everyone , i have a son ! someday , scott , this will all be yours .

hi .

virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year .

do n't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars ? a million dollars is n't that much money these days .

people have to tell me these things . i 've been frozen for thirty years , throw me a bone here . ok , no problem . here 's my second plan . back in the sixties i had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a `` laser . '' using this laser , we punch a hole in the protective layer around the earth , which we scientists call the `` ozone layer . '' slowly but surely , ultraviolet rays would pour in , increasing the risk of skin cancer . that is , unless the world pays us a hefty ransom .

austin is very charming , very debonair . he 's handsome , witty , has a knowledge of fine wines , sophisticated , a world-renowned photographer . women want him , men want to be him . he 's a lover of love -- every bit an international man of mystery .

you have to understand , in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth . it did n't matter .

i do n't wan na take over the family business .

no need . i 'll call again .

there are limits ?

seriously ?

sir august merryweather ? i was looking for something relaxing . say , a tuscan hillside in june ?

shame . i was recommended . by a friend .

peter ...

... love ...

nature ...

flower ...

... death ...

black ...

... bottle ...

sir august ... ? what now ?

you mean you do n't recall ? ?

you

out in india . so character-forming for the british . not the heat . good lord , no . the rain , dash it . a good monsoon . fifteen inches overnight . a whole week of lovely rain . i remember one summer in jaipur ...

i so agree . how did you acquire a taste for it ?

then you ca n't come in .

impossible ?

i 'm afraid that 's impossible .

congratulations , mrs. peel . you have been a worthy opponent . you have tracked us down . you are within an ace of winning .

quite a collection .

this is an official matter , mrs. peel . no need to take it personally . where are you going ?

who ?

a cover ... for us . i 'm sorry ...

watch me .

you need treatment , mrs. peel . you ca n't resign .

i resign .

let me guess -- 'father ' ?

looks like rain , steed ...

then what 's stopping you ?

right , bridesmaid . now what have i left out ? oh , yes , i know : the ring .

oh , no , emma . they 've only just begun ...

you disappoint me , emma . ca n't you guess ? for you . it was all for you ...

but i found you . all the clues led me here ...

pity your mother came , too ...

english weather . you know , after all we 've been through , i should say we deserve a long holiday ...

the plot . hello , we must be going ...

what kept you ?

what 's that you 're wearing ?

you did n't tell her ?

we must hurry , mrs. peel ...

i told mother i took care of you .

as far as you trust me .

winning is n't everything .

you 're playing games .

i could be convinced , if ... i knew who poisoned me in the maze . that kiss ...

and do you trust me ?

... when i do n't . it comes down to one thing , mrs. peel . trust .

because you always obey orders ...

the winslow home for retired lepidoptorists . i 'm so sorry i struck you , mrs. peel . please forgive me . i thought you were someone else ...

i expect we 'll have to gatecrash .

here 's the one that broke the camel 's back .

have i trespassed on a male prerogative ? we 're being followed . i saw him at trubshaw 's ...

exactly . there 'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea . propane gas mostly . in small quantities it captures chlorine . protects the ozone layer . but it proved impractical . too bulky ...

the prospero project was started by my husband . it was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming . in theory , climate engineering is entirely feasible . we thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite . a 'quick fix ' ...

is there anything that is n't ?

she had this in her mouth . there , there ...

common knowledge , mrs. peel ...

colonel crabtree . international satellite systems . formerly of the ministry .

i must say , you look more your old self --

an invitation . to a 'formal picnic ' ... ?

that 's possible . sir august was convinced he 'd met me before . but i 'd never met him . another odd thing . when it rained , he said it was just as someone had promised .

i might say the same .

you should be dead . how do you feel ?

ah , brenda ... mrs. peel ?

so ... i distract him while you snoop around ? how ?

all of a piece , really . a fanatical weatherman . chairman of brolly . british royal organisation for lasting liquid years . thinks british weather has been tampered with by ... aliens .

the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined .

not so much eccentric . more barking mad . he has a wife called june . and a daughter somewhere -- julie .

an eccentric recluse ?

i meant me .

that 's predictable . when i find a queen in need of protection i 'll let you know .

but why ? what 's the point ?

you know what i mean . this car -- and you . nobody walks around like that . milk ?

steed , we really must be --

or half cocked .

oh , absolutely , but trubshaw 's a man worth meeting . no point setting out half shod .

i thought we were on our way .

i had a feeling you would . touche !

not by me . play by the rules , doctor , or the game is nothing .

doctor peel , i presume ?

i 'm going to find out who killed my husband . will you take these documents to steed ?

you 're not venturing alone , surely .

let me guess : wonderland weather .

privately owned by ...

i was getting to it .

father . she gave him an 'all clear ' after a security test by dr. darling .

now let 's see ... eton , cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics . overtaken by peter 's work on the physics of climate change ...

peter 's brother ? but --

i see .

talk to the pipe , mrs. peel . that usually helps . do n't worry about me being invisible . other than that i 'm perfectly normal .

how did you guess ?

we want mrs. peel .

mother and father know best .

her husband suspected someone very close to the operation . on the day he died , he was setting a test . to prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion . he had to be certain . he said he was going to give mrs. peel something ...

too late anyway . today 's escapade was only for starters . this is no ordinary weather . it 's manmade . a kind of weather bomb .

still does n't . better safe than sorry . she was in a dangerous game , steed . high stakes . she may prove to be a risk . if she is , there 's only one solution . termination .

how come you took so much interest in her , dr. darling ?

something went wrong . system malfunction . explosion . mrs. peel had a narrow escape . suspected sabotage . nothing proven . file still open .

she may try to kill you .

amnesia ?

wonderland weather ltd .

both , actually .

walk over to the window ...

come , come . you do n't really expect me to fall for --

are n't you forgetting about something ?

perish the thought .

john steed .

look at that guy . what a hunk .

deb , i want to throw you a shower .

... really ?

debbie 's marrying rick .

i feel like i 'm spying on rick .

i do n't get it , but at least gary 's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes .

sex is my one thing . i 'm good at it .

yeah , man . let 's throw a bachelor party with drugs , booze and broads .

what ?

man , you 're losing your audience .

too bad , man , that blows my chance to be ambassador to france .

we 're going for a little liquid refreshment .

fan out and look for them .

she 's mine !

you 've had it . i 'm gon na get you .

cole , when was the last time you had a lobotomy ?

maybe it had something to do .

what is this person 's story here ?

five thousand dollars .

yes i did .

mr. thomerson .

yes , sir .

right . hey , shut up . okay , sir .

yes , sir , i am .

nice shot .

sure have ...

that 's all right , deb . go be happy and smile a lot , deb . do it for me .

you 're on .

see ? and these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- i did n't want any of them . you ... you 're what i want . understand ?

i am committed . i love you .

i do n't want that . i want to be with you .

why do n't you get undressed .

how wonderful . a seeing eye hooker .

do n't turn on the lights , sugar . i 'll lead you around .

well , if i go back on my word , i 'll kill her .

you 're really pissing me off .

sorry , we got men 's business to do . it 's no place for a lady .

ca n't i just go with you guys ?

gon na get married ...

you better not have too much joy .

before or after i have my nervous breakfown ?

what 's the matter ?

stop fooling around ... i need to talk .

yes , but looks are deceiving ... not in this case , however .

you 're going to have a bachelor party ?

not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me .

but a fabulous cook .

i know what i 'm doing ... go !

ilene , are you crazy ?

look , girls -- i 'll stay behind and hold them off . the rest of you break for it !

debbie , do n't be naive . men are pigs .

of course you do . i trusted my ex , mel , too . cousin , i can only talk from experience . what do you think they do at these parties , have tea and play scrabble ?

you know your father enjoys his company .

any time , al .

thanks for helping us out , ed . we appreciate it .

i think i screwed that one once .

ed , we 're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant .

why ?

what are you ...

what are you talking about , asshole ?

they 'll be up there in a half hour .

let 's see your bread .

gary , how we doing , big stallion ?

guy paints a beautiful picture .

milt ?

that i got . very good women . they sit on your face , anything you want .

that 's it .

i hate her . i hate her guts , the bitch .

just in love with everybody . it 's really a beautiful planet . i love you , rick . i love you guys . i love everybody .

it 's really not all your fault . i was talking to mike earlier and he had a lot of problems . personal things , you know . made some bad investments . at least now he 's peaceful ...

yeah . i see you 're right . c'mon , let 's party .

all right . now , there 's milk and cookies in the refrigerator . go to bed right after `` falcon crest . ''

what do you mean , it changes ?

my marriage is the worst . all crap . a big pile of shit .

you 're all under arrest . open up !

it 's on the tenth floor .

oh , no !

rick , i want to cut through the b.s .

ca n't i just maim it a little ?

no , brett , i ...

you 've been having strange sex ... !

i 'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there . could you undo a few buttons ?

klupner . mrs. klupner .

i do n't know ... go up to her , make like you do n't know her and send her into the other bedroom .

debbie .

i 'll stop him ... you stall him .

what can i do ? i 'm dead . debbie 's going to go crazy and end the whole thing .

how about this , a trojan donkey .

take care .

now , do n't get into any trouble .

very .

got me .

oooooo .

this is your bachelor party . you have n't had sex with anyone yet .

rick , i 'm concerned .

i do n't know . maybe it 's because i love debbie or maybe it 's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad . i 'm not sure .

the best table in the house .

hey , i 'm starved ... let 's go get something to eat . we 'll bring back food for everybody .

nothing ... let 's get crazy !

she probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. o'neill , let 's pick up the guys for a drink ... i have major news to announce .

great . i was wondering , how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing ?

nah , not yet . look , you 're my older brother . i need some advice here . what 's the deal with marriage ? what can i expect ?

get going , rick ... you 're late enough as it is .

i do n't know .

how the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside ?

there 's a fire . we 've got a job here . let 's get on with it .

-- what the fuck were you thinking , huh ? burning people ? you 're a fireman .

it is n't safe , man . do n't go splittin ' us up . not with this one .

adcox , go with pengelly and check the other side .

we 're gon na be okay , man ...

biggest in two battalions .

oh these moments do try me ...

-- shut up ! your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you 've shit on his department !

my lt. might have something to say about that .

i 'll handle it .

oh god , stephen , what 's going on with you ?

maybe i do . ... what a fuckin ' mess , huh ? people can change brian .

i saw it before it got them . i tried to yell , but ... he asked me to look out for him . and i did n't do it . i let him die .

when dad died , i saw another fire ...

i really should get back . there 's ... there 's something i 'm supposed to do .

just ... just wanted to say hello ...

... not now , brian .

that 's not what it 's about , brian . the point is there was a kid in there . and what if there 'd been two ? i went in because that 's what i do . it 's my way . it 's dad 's way . it is n't everybody 's way .

i waited ... i would have fucking waited ...

listen to it , brian ... jump when i say ... it wo n't get us .

christ , stephen , let 's wait for the hose team ...

what , is it the stairs ? christ , i 'll let you win next time .

roll the hose .

nah , he 's nothin ' . it 's just sometimes ... sometimes you just got ta punch somebody out , y'know ?

hey .

goddamn it stephen !

i 'm in heaven , lt .

thanks for the speakers .

so that 's it ? big bad brother 's gon na ride my ass till i cough blood ?

what is it with you , man , huh ? how do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up ? that scotch bullshit ? am i really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz ? you were bankrupt , man .

millions , stephen -- and sexual favors .

it works .

i want to thank you for coming to my graduation , stephen . it was a great inspiration to me .

well , look what we have here . nice costume . rent it ?

who asked you ?

it does n't go like that .

i 'll see ya around , huh ?

i think your boss is going to need some spin control .

just take it .

y'know , four years ago i was working in a bakery . two years ago i was bringing marty coffee and he did n't even know my name . i run that office now . marty believed in me and i believe in him . you want me to just throw that away ?

you could check . it 'd be in his files .

hi .

-- i work for the city .

-- you could have scared the son of a bitch off . we may never bust him now . all for a couple 's political points .

brian . what 's wrong ?

uh huh .

well , our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment . this area is the pumping panel , which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose .

i wanted to be a good one .

this is one of the oldest fire stations in the city . lotta tradition locked up in here . what do you think ?

marty did . but i wanted you to come to .

well , you did invite me here .

hey ... so are you dating your boss or what ?

yeah ? well , maybe i can fit it in ...

how 's it going ?

brian , do you always have to be so stupid ? think about your future for once .

c'mon jennifer , he 's just another north-side jag-off with a mouth .

yeah , well i like to think i 'm just a little past hanging out on jp ii watching the irish pick fights and litwalks barf in the planters .

why do you think marty came here tonight ? because he cares about your department . you do n't know how hard he works . you do n't know about his programs helping west side --

yeah . swayzak . humanity 's last hope . how can you work for that guy ?

let me tell you something . martin swayzak is going to be this town 's next mayor .

i work for city hall .

yeah ? what have you been up to ?

uh ... i 've been sorta keeping a low profile ... the academy ... i graduated today .

you 're back .

sure you do .

i 'm close ... but i ca n't get who it is ...

you walked out on this academy six years ago . one week to graduation . you think we forgot that ? you think i did ?

like it never happened ...

another couple of good men get burned up for their city ? is that how it 's going to read ? you 're the only one that knows .

yeah .

i 've been lying here hours ... just thinking ... we 're close ... we 're not looking in the right place , brian . this one knows us and we 're not looking in the right place ...

well brian , i guess you can say it 's arson now ...

i 'm finished with swayzak . i 'll do whatever you want me to do . i just want to help catch the guy that burned tim . you got ta give me another shot .

what the hell are you doing here ?

that 's why the sealant on the doors ... so what have we got , a torch with a conscience ?

what reason ?

but he could have killed everybody there . the firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall . the backdraft blew out the flame . that 's it . that 's the reason .

but he killed these guys .

i got it after we talked to ronald . torches . want to fry the whole goddamn world . but the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much . -- the burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls . and he made his burns backdrafts .

that 's it ! oh , that son of a bitch , he 's different , goddamn it ! you see what this tells us , huh ? our killer does n't love fire !

i do n't work for them , either .

but the right guess on this is arson .

`` trychtichlorate is a binary structured -- ''

read .

i think we should get something straight here . i was assigned to this office by the city .

oh , man , i 'm sorry .

well that 's two things to strangle stephen for . where is he , anyway ?

yeah , we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young .

this one 's still with the fire department . one of our best investigators , don rimgale , is working on a very difficult , visible case right now . we think he could use another pair of hands and you 're exactly the kind of guy i want representing us : an authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan .

no need to be modest , brian .

uh , i think there 's been a mistake . i did n't save that woman .

could you believe that fire ? man ! first day ! there i was , adcox and me , pullin ' that lady right out of the fire 's fuckin ' throat ! i love it here -- no surround and drown for this company . fighting 17th ! goddamn stephen 's amazing . you see how he took that fire by the balls ? i 'm gon na be that good some day , you watch .

engine 115 , right ?

are n't you even curious ?

i was ahead of my time .

management were pin heads .

and die !

i 'll be there .

-- i 'm busy goddamn it , okay ?

i hate it when we got ta fucking go look for it .

i do n't want to confuse him , stephen .

-- no , that 's okay . it 's just sean ...

stephen ... i ... can i talk to you a second ...

what 's wrong ?

i 'm sorry ... i ... could n't sleep ...

ah stephen , that 's what this is really about , is n't it ? you always have to be right .

he treats you okay ?

i just wanted to , i do n't know , not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since i do n't remember much of it --

give up , babe . you ca n't fight it . believe me , my mom tried ...

where 's sean ?

stephen , what are you doing here ?

probably got in cosgrove 's clothes in a gas state from the fire .

mccaffrey , hold this for us .

there 's something else kinda interesting ...

and old ladies ?

tell him about me , shadow ?

is he a fireman ? i like firemen .

did n't think you 'd make it .

is there a connection between them , alderman ?

we still have n't found a connection between the victims .

do n't you have any leads at all ?

you mean you could use it .

who ?

that jesus christ was the son of god and he came to die for your sins .

brown downtown ... there has n't been any smoking brown on the street in --

that 's no mystery . julio and paolo brought it in , you do n't want to hurt those boys , do you ? i mean , they sure as hell have got something coming , but it ai n't what the law wants to give them . you understand ? no . how could you understand .

yes .

you brought it back to the church . and then it made it 's way back to me , again .

i know . take care of yourself , man , ok ? be cool .

how are you doing , man ?

fuck you . just give me back a little something for the road .

i forgive you .

oh god , my god . it 's goddamn good to be good . forgive me . father , for i have sinned . it 's still goddamn good to be good .

why do i dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death ? and why have i never forgotten that if she , then i --

i forgive you .

you ca n't forgive me . after what i 've done . i 've fucked up bigtime . i 've been bad . real bad .

here 's the deal : you meet me tonight across from the garden . 33rd & 8th . at the beginning of the ninth inning . we 'll listen to the end of the game together . you bring your cash , i 'll bring mine .

yeah , really . i 'm no fucking asshole , man . i 'm a fucking cop !

fuck yesterday 's game . the world series is seven games not six . put in my bet .

what about the money you owe me on yesterday 's game ?

large ?

you 've really got a problem .

what case ?

good . i 'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble . i hate that motherfucking house and --

do you have the money ?

ok asshole . you owe thirty grand . now what are you gon na do ?

all right . what are you gon na do ?

i got them all going for oakland . with bullshit money . we 'll cover the $ 800 .

those boys , those sad , raging boys ... they came to me as the needy do . and like many of the needy , they were rude . like all the needy , they took . and like all the needy , they needed . father . i knew them ; they learn in our school . and play in our schoolyard . and they are good boys .

father , if it was so trivial , so natural , so -- no . i have sinned . and you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition , and to absolve me . father , what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve god ?

yo , big black , we needs a name for this joint .

yeah !

c'mon . it 's easy . it 's the same thing y'all do out at the yankee game , no different 'cept we changing one word . everybody go it ?

i 'm gon na start a chant and i want y'all to follow me . let 's make our own 2 real coons know you 're ready to start the show .

if you think i 'm a house nigga then that 's your prerogative . you got your ways to affect change , i have mine . and i would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house .

if you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours . what 's his name again ?

so now i see where you 're coming from . just because we ai n't rapping about gucci , timberland , rolex , benz , cristal , ho 's and bitches , we 're pseudo .

my group we need some exposure . was wondering if you could hook a brother up ?

i order out mostly . so what do i owe this visit to ?

big black is the first name and africa is the last .

i 'm a revolutionary .

good . i 've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway .

jim jones , y'know . i 'm not drinking the kool-aid .

why they got ta make my nose so big ?

moorish . ya get a little taste of dat booty , ya wan na get some more .

no shame in ya game . she got ya nostrils , ya chnoz is wide open . sloan 's what we certified ladies ' men call low hanging fruit .

it 's that bad , huh ? it 's all over my face .

naw , not you . it ca n't be . that hottie sloan hopkins .

i 'm not smiling .

you might be right .

nice to meet you .

you 'll both get an advance and you can stay with me .

good morning to you , mr. delapot .

we ran out without my shoes and the floor . i got ta get my stuff . what about our savings ?

i 'm tired of waiting .

chill , i 'm the brains behind this outfit .

ahh , the luxuries of life .

you have to start getting into your character .

mantan ? i do n't even care as long as i 'm dancing . which reminds me , i need some new kicks .

you 're now mantan .

manray , sloan says you 're too talented to be dancing on the street .

are you trying to excuse our holocaust ?

because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country . gary , i have no problem with people disagreeing with the show , it 's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist , that 's when i get mad . no one , in any way , shape or form should be censored .

our guest today is pierre delacroix . he is the creator of the highly controversial tv show mantan . let 's get right into it . you have been called by some in the community a traitor , a sellout , an uncle tom . why does your show generate such feelings ?

i will not be held responsible for these revisions . these changes are not the way i want to go . this is an outrage . this is a sham . a violation !

what are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky madonna video ?

you 're telling me some white boy is gon na direct this pilot ?

i want a hot , young white director . maybe the kid , that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy madonna video .

i was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself , if not the pilot soon after .

to hire someone solely on their ethnicity , gender or religion is not right . it 's un-american . i will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job .

that'swhati'mtalkin '' bout . that'swhati'mtalkin '' bout ! he 's off the hiz-hook !

what are you talkin ' 'bout ? it 's the move . stay wid me now . we 're movin ' fast . what does everybody else think about this ?

and every week these alabama porch monkeys will make us cry , make us laugh , make us look at our own humanity . make us feel good to be alive .

protest finally forced `` amos and andy '' off the air . could stop us from ever getting on .

this could be bigger than `` amos and andy . ''

mantan and sleep ' n eat . two real coons . i know we 're way out there but it 's satire .

go on . good so far .

i 'm wid it .

what is it you want from me ? some plantation follies ? some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch ? some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads ? you want me to go back to the ante bellum days ?

i 'm not sure if i can deliver what you want .

i 've never been given a fair shot .

the middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave . the middle class black family moves into a small southern town that is run by the kkk . the middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter . the middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter . the middle class single black mother raises her teenage son . and so on and so forth . it 's too clean , too antiseptic ...

i understand . but again , in all honesty i was not informed .

c.p . time is colored people 's time . the stereotypical belief that negroes are always late . that negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance .

i did n't find out about this very important staff meeting until ...

do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone ?

i 'm sorry i 'm late .

baby , you treat me so good . peerless , you 're a good son , i love you . you never gave me no trouble .

i did n't mean that , in life .

nuthin ' i ca n't handle .

good woman . i trained her right .

pull up a chair . oh , excuse me , this is my lady dot .

how long has my father been like this ?

is that so ?

i did n't think this was in your studies at nyu .

and that 's how you got me in the first place .

work related or otherwise ?

this is crazy .

that which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light . this bucket of blood .

do you have to be so damn forthright ?

oh , is he ? you getting jiggy with mantan ?

that crazy brother of yours does n't think so .

how long have you and hambone been hangin ' out ?

to me , it shows part of our history in this country , a time when we were considered inferior , sub-human .

for what ?

what is this ?

c'mon . you were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family . you gave your brother a shot . that 's all anybody can ask for , an opportunity , a chance , a shot . he got his .

the pleasure is mine .

break a leg .

i 'm gon na slit my wrists . cut my throat . for the love of joseph .

hello .

like i said , all this for some twisted , distorted sense of principal . dunwitty , he just tolerates your negroidal ass , he does n't respect it .

this is cheeba .

and lose out on my money ? the only way i get paid is if i get fired . and that 's what i intend to do .

ca n't you just quit ? walk away ?

good . i 'm going to need your support .

sounds risky to me .

not yet , but this thing will never get made .

how can this be ? you and me at the same time , the exact same thought . it 's scary .

manray !

nobody told me anything .

kook and the gang , it 's manray . let 's do the taping . you go back to your dressing room , get dressed and blacken up .

mantan , we got a show to tape .

let me ask you a question , if i may . how do you think she got the job in the first place ? i do n't mean to burst your bubble , mantan the marvelous , but sloan is an opportunity .

what you did is dead wrong .

sloan , will you take your boss out of here so i can get ready .

i did n't mean it to sound like that .

pressure ? dela , you do n't know what the hell real pressure is . sheeett ! ! ! this is lightstuff . now when you scramblin ' out on the street in da january winter and the hawk is talkin ' to you with no money and no prospects of money anytime soon , now that there is some pressure .

peerless , last time , go see your father .

that 's wonderful . is n't that what you always wanted , a show of your own ?

ca n't beat it with a hammer . well , since you asked , it looks like i may have a new show , a pilot being shot .

you hear me talkin ' to you . the only time you come up here when something is wrong .

thank you for correcting my ignorance . i 'm looking forward to working side by side with you . i feel we make a good team .

ahhh ! ! ! i never heard of that term before . i thought you were black of african-american . no ?

helsinki , which is the capital of finland .

let myrna finish .

why do you say that ? you 've never seen me .

if that was suppose to be a compliment , i thank you .

a little . i just graduated from nyu film school . cinema studies .

you sing and dance ?

not a class , not a thing , just picked stuff up by myself .

i do n't know what a retort is , but it 's simple . mantan - the new millennium minstrel show is universal . it 's not just for negroes in compton or 125th in harlem . this is america . our ancestors helped build this country , we got a right , just like everybody else . i 'm not gon na box myself in . this show makes people think , and they 're laughing at the same time .

money makes the world go round . it ai n't no joke being poor . i know whati'mtalkin '' bout . y'knowwhati'msayin ' ? i 've lived on the street . i 've been homeless . i 've learned how to play the game , work the game , be in the game .

mantan , dat sho ' is a whopper .

sleep ' n eat , i was my wife 's husband and grandchild at one and the same time . and lo ' and behold , as the husband of a person 's grandmother is his grandfather , i mantan , became my own grandfather .

hold on , you allegorical hypothesis . do n't cross words with me .

... like macaroni and cheese ...

that 's what i like about you and me . we git along ...

... too late , maybe around ...

... then what about ...

... too early ...

around ...

i heard ya lady is wild .

i 'll buy her a less expensive dress , so i can have some money left over to take her out to dinner .

not for me , my woolly headed cotton pickin ' friend for ...

sleep ' n eat , one of dem slinky , sexy , little foxy ...

well , thank you mistuh sleep ' n eat .

no mo ' `` city slickers . '' ahh , ca n't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton ?

our alabamy home . now we 're getting countrified . we is bama 's .

that 's ancient history . that has nothing to do with you and i .

and ?

what ?

y'know what ?

we can look out for ourselves .

just a little something ' somethin ' .

enough .

a lot ?

good day to you , young sir .

i never was more in earnest .

you say he drives after breakfast and before dinner . when he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box , and the coachman will get his orders to move on .

i am not sure . the prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money , he would have to fight for it .

you are a hungarian ; you served in the army , and left on account of weakness in the loins . he gambles a great deal , and wins . do you know the cards well ?

there is lately come to berlin a gentleman in the service of the empress queen , who calls himself the chevalier de belle fast , and wears the red riband and star of the pope 's order of the spur . he is made for good society , polished , obliging , a libertine , without prejudices , fond of women , of good food , of high play , prudent and discreet .

the captain was the nephew and heir of the minister of police , herr galgenstein , a relationship which , no doubt , aided in the younger gentlemen 's promotion .

neither !

where 's the beauty you promised me ?

oh , yes , of course , ambassador o'grady ...

o'grady .

is miss dugan well ?

i suppose she addressed them to me in my real name , by which i never thought to ask for them at the post office .

look here , roderick , my boy ; this is silly business . the girl will marry best , mark my words ; and as sure as she does , you 'll forget her . you are but a boy . best is willing to consider you as such . dublin 's a fine place , and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month , here are twenty guineas at your service . make best an apology , and be off .

a pretty day 's work of it you have made , master roderick . knowing your uncle to be distressed for money , and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family ? best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so . he takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past , and missing them all , and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father .

your grace , if i am so tame as to take this , then i must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation .

your grace owes me seventy thousand frederics , which i have honorably won .

i do n't know .

i deny your grace 's accusations , and beg you to say how you have been cheated ?

i have no luggage .

as you please .

it is shameful -- infamous ! i insist upon being put down at the austrian ambassador 's house .

but , if they send you away , then what is to become of me ?

i have faced that problem before .

i can play as soldiers do , but have no great skill .

the cards are now my only livelihood . sometimes i am in luck , and then i lay out my money in these trinkets you see . it 's property , look you , and the only way i have found of keeping a little about me . when the luck goes against me , why , my dear , my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and i wear paste . do you understand the cards ?

and i think he was as much affected as i was at thus finding one of his kindred ; for he , too , was an exile from home , and a friendly voice , a look , brought the old country back to his memory again , and the old days of his boyhood .

no one , sir . before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins .

then you yield to me .

lady cosgrove , you are an old fool .

as soon as i saw you loved me , i was pleased , and i gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me , being certain that , for my part , i would never love you . but after our first kiss , i found that i had no power over myself . i did not know that one kiss could matter so much .

let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that i am happy .

o , my dearest love . enough ! i beg you . stop believing in your experience . you have never known love . my very soul is leaving me ! catch it on your lips , and give me yours !

will we always leave it at this ?

to make me wretched in two weeks .

it is nonetheless a misfortune , and you will know it when you love .

jump twenty feet ! you would n't dare to do any such thing on daisy . there 's the captain 's horse , black george , i 've heard say that captain bes --

well , then , i 'll tell you what i 'd do . i 'd jump daisy into the river , and swim you both across , where no enemy could follow us .

i 'd draw my sword , and cut my way through them .

oh ! i can dance with you any day , and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner . besides , roderick , captain best 's a man , and you are only a boy , and you have n't a guinea in the world .

were you obliged to dance five times with captain best , and then stroll out with him into the garden ?

with pleasure at finding the ribbon .

i feel the ribbon .

have you done , mr. cosgrove ?

do you happen to know gustavus adolphus , the thirteenth earl of crabs ?

the king has determined to send the chevalier out of the country .

a meeting with the prince of turbingen is impossible .

as you have been robbed of your purse , may i have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home ?

i am riding to dublin myself , and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you , i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap .

everything -- my purse , containing upwards of a hundred guineas , my jewels , my snuff-boxes , watches . and all because this blundering coward fell to his knees ...

oh , i am grateful to you , sir . i am the wife of captain o'reilly hastening to join him at dublin . my chair was stopped by a highwayman ; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees , armed as he was , and though there were thirty people in the next field , working , when the ruffian attacked , not one of them would help but , on the contrary , wished him `` good luck . ''

there are a few other points we should discuss . the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship 's signature , and provided that bracegirdle and chatwick can be assured of her ladyship 's freewill in giving her signature .

considering your financial circumstances , mr. cosgrove , it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you . i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity . but , obviously , if you would reject this offer , i shall keep trying to find a better one .

is he all right , papa ?

yes , papa .

papa ?

good night , my little darling .

good night , papa .

now , just have a little patience , my boy . your birthday is n't until next week .

sir , let those laugh that win .

in truth , sir , yes , but , if you must marry , then marry a virtuous drudge .

would you have me spend my life all alone ?

hang it , mr. roderick james , you have no more manners than a barber , and i think my black footman has been better educated than you ; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck , and i like you , sir . because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own .

will he wish to know the details of this night ?

he loves me , as i love you .

old friend . have n't talked to him in -- 911. can i use your phone ?

hey !

hey , i -- holy fuck ... holy fuck , what the fuck did you guys do ?

we found him like this ...

we do n't know . west is dead .

washout rejects , guys he said were `` dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead '' ...

jesus !

we do n't need the tapes --

we 're not finished yet --

but not pike 's .

they would have killed us both . you want me to write a confession , i 'll write a confession .

you shot childs and nunez .

and he 'd been shot .

i apologize --

i did n't shoot west --

he 's lying .

that son of a bitch .

yeah . and that 's all i 'm saying .

okay ... but i would like to know about the other cadets . what they were like -- nice guys ?

okay .

you did basic here ?

i do n't know ... i like the army .

well , it 's a game of anticipation , that 's the beauty .

why not ?

how do you know that ?

we can prove that you 're not ray dunbar . impersonating a fellow cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --

no , did he tell you about it ? about the business childs ran ?

yeah . spent half his time in the infirmary . only reason he enlisted was his father . west did n't section him till last week .

epilepsy .

he was sickly . had that shaking thing , whatd'yacall it , epoxy ?

there were six of us ...

dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours ! he is not to be given food , water , or clothes ! if he so much as moves , you are to blow his nigger brains out , is that clear ?

sir , yes , sir !

so did we . why did n't you come ?

he would n't kill anybody ...

we wait and i 'm a dead man . i got a black face , a criminal record , and over a hundred other cadets who 'll testify how much i hated west -- my court martial will take six minutes . it 's either me or them , ray , and you got ta decide right now .

i ... i do n't know ...

from up close or far away ?

that still does n't mean you did n't kill him .

combat grade morphine . mueller sold it to me .

you hated west , mueller loved him --

oh , come on --

you 're the only one missing a grenade .

yeah ...

do i ?

roberto , what the fuck ?

i mean i killed him . is n't that what we all wanted ?

or you , levi ? when is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him ?

then we 'll leave it up to the courts -- his word against mine . what does his father do again ? steelworker ? does n't matter , i 'm sure justice will be served . in any case , my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions , these accusations on his son . he 's quite protective .

sorry to disappoint . i 'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind . you 're right , it was nunez . any more questions ?

why did you tell us he shot everybody , levi ? you put him in for three murders , the man saved your life --

is it the truth ?

why did he come back for you ?

right in front of us . mueller went after him but we held him back .

he admitted it .

but you did n't .

then who did ?

i did n't kill him --

levi , i do n't know if you 're familiar with investigative work , but we have this little thing called `` motive '' and you just gave yourself one .

he is not , shall we say , wild about the idea . he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities , and i have done my best to oblige him . however , in the last four weeks , i began a relationship with another cadet . what do you think of that ?

you want to get into a finger pointing contest about character ? the army kicked you out for drugs , the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster , and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct ? there 's only one criminal standing in this room and it 's you .

toxicology report came back . kendall 's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine , maybe you 've heard of it . it 's for asthmatics . if an epileptic takes enough , it kills them . i checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you 're the only other person who visited kendall .

i 'm not going to cover for you , bill . not for this .

it was so good , i actually forgot you 're one of the bigger dogs now . the base commander . the one in control . you could n't let him testify , could you ?

the senator ...

you think you could explain all this to me ?

it 's over . time of death was 4:42. jag 's been notified and i called the senator myself . my report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable ... you two had no culpability in the matter .

does osborne agree ?

what the hell are you talking about --

tom , where are you going --

okay , then let 's widen the search to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car --

someone must have got a shot off . he was n't exactly a moving target .

pike killed west , dunbar killed mueller , childs , and nunez .

which gives us about five hours . why 'd you call me ?

the exercise was one of his section eight `` private sessions '' . left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning .

and here you are going out of house . how 's that make you feel , jules ?

yeah . but he was a lot of other things , too . thanks .

he was your friend .

in case you need me to testify about the shooting . they 'll clear you .

a word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss ? probably not the best time to hit on them .

west ?

far as i 'm concerned , whatever you did in the past can stay in the past .

you 're a good man , hardy .

no bodies , no west ...

where 's west 's body ?

we can tie you to the chair if it 'll work better for you --

hardy , what are you doing --

we got maybe three minutes till they break it down .

get in .

think it 'll work ?

you wanted to break him .

yeah , i could 've . should 've .

good idea .

why do n't you talk to levi off the record for a second ?

positive . hardy , they planned this .

what kendall said -- `` the type of guys you do n't feel comfortable going to sleep around . '' that 's what dunbar said about childs to the letter .

they got their stories straight .

kendall maybe would have agreed , but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --

they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent .

what happened next ?

west was a monster ! fifteen years ago , i was here , i was section eight , i was pike . fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did , stripping pike down , making him stand outside all night ? he did that every year , he did that to me . fifteen years ago , i wanted him dead , and now i 'm supposed to care that somebody offed him ? sorry , no can do . i tried .

watch me .

you knew what he was capable of and you just stood by . it was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass , and you know what ? he deserved it . there 's your confession .

everyone 's capable of murder , osborne .

i just ... he came back for kendall . i do n't think he 's capable of murder .

i lied . wait for it ...

have no fear , osborne , we have not yet begun to fight .

being back here . gives me the willies .

something wrong ?

you guys really got the shit kicked out of you here .

i plan to grow on you .

you do understand that there 's absolutely no way i could ever be attracted to you , right ?

the very same .

what is that ?

you 're right . we should sit in silence .

is dunbar cute ?

why ?

yes .

kendall junior is still in surgery , so he wo n't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we 're talking to first is dunbar .

it was for suspicion of bribery , it 's really all in the wording --

i did n't mean that as a compliment .

you knew sergeant west ?

although that wo n't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --

i do n't think i want to hear this --

how ?

oh , you remember now --

they found him . poor fucker was practically blown in half --

the faggot speaks .

maybe we should n't go .

he came after us . and i told dunbar he had to kill him ...

we did get our stories straight , but not because we killed anyone . it was because i threatened him .

it will and you know why ? because you 're not a person anymore , you 're a cadet in the united states army ; you have no identity , no miranda warning , and no rights . so i 'm gon na throw you to the wolves , and unlike you , i 'm gon na get away with it , because you 're pissing me off !

`` you 're gon na die tonight , faggot '' . clear as day .

he could n't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own .

shut up !

until we return to base , and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant west 's body --

you are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --

cadet michael mueller , i hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of sergeant nathan west --

we all know what you did , pike . i do n't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here , but --

thank god ...

the army kicked you out for drugs ...

gets on his plane in ten minutes , which means you two are done . you 'll understand if i do n't walk you out .

what do you think ?

no --

he 's not army , it 's not official --

thank you .

a few rabbits , but i think one of them was already dead .

did n't kill anything , did i ?

sorry , kid . i do n't do charity .

kid . do n't waste your time . she 's out of your league .

who is she ? where does she live ?

i 'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her . that or die alone .

tough break . most men have to get married before they lose their wives .

i just saw the woman i 'm going to marry , i know it . but then i lost her .

that 's great .

you wo n't find a better place !

no . i 've got ta meet somebody . i 'm already running late .

what is this place ?

oh . here ! right here . edward bloom . we were n't expecting you yet .

welcome to ya . what 's your name ?

bloom !

i brought it .

you get the eye ?

fine , you do it .

then do it .

your mother came in about three in the afternoon . her neighbor drove her , on account of your father was on business in wichita . you were born a week early , but there were no complications . it was a perfect delivery . now , your father was sorry to miss it , but it was n't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then , so i ca n't see as it would have been much different had he been there . and that 's the real story of how you were born .

dr. bennett . it 's good to see you . my wife , josephine .

and from the moment i saw her until the moment i die , she 's the only one .

i 'll ...

in so many words , yes .

apparently i 've overlooked this one piece of it , and i 'd like to remedy that . you see , in order for the town to be preserved , the trust must own it in its entirety .

and when i 'm 38 , you 'll be 48. and that 's not much difference at all .

it 's not a woman , it 's a fish . no one ever catches her .

well , she ... uh ...

what did she look like ?

i like your stories .

is it the medicine that 's making you thirsty ?

well , we were all set to , but there was a complication .

oh , so this is a tall tale ?

that 's because we did n't have a wedding . your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me . she was engaged to somebody else .

he was slipping her a little extra cream .

means when you dream about something that 's going to happen . like one night , i had a dream where this crow came and told me , `` your aunt is going to die . '' i was so scared i woke up my parents . they told me it was just a dream , to go back to bed . but the next morning , my aunt stacy was dead .

just to be sure , you can take my pack .

that poet , norther winslow did . he was going to paris , france . he must have liked it , because no one ever heard from him again . tell you what . you take the other way and i 'll cut through here . meet you on the far side .

beats me .

what 's your name , giant ?

hardly two stories in the whole place . now i 've heard in real cities , they 've got buildings so tall you ca n't even see the tops of 'em .

okay . okay .

like this .

how what happens ?

yourself . good , bad , everything . just show me who you are for once .

what do you want , will ? who do you want me to be ?

you tell lies , dad . you tell amusing lies . stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime . they 're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty . and the thing is , i believed you . i believed your stories so much longer than i should have . and then when i realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything ! -- i felt like such a fool to have trusted you . you were like santa claus and the easter bunny combined . just as charming and just as fake .

i 've told you a thousand facts . that 's all i do , will . i tell stories .

i have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact .

dad !

the maple tree and the buick . we heard it .

it 's rude to talk about religion . you never know who you 're going to offend .

i thought you were n't dying .

i used to do it when you were gone , remember ? i used to do it a lot .

you know where the chemicals are ?

your mother has n't been keeping up the pool . if you wanted to you could ...

really .

i saw my death in that eye . and this is not how it happens .

the old lady by the swamp .

no , but i hear it 's terrible . then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child , fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine .

i 'm not scared .

come on , will . everyone likes that story .

jesus christ .

what , a father 's not allowed to talk about his son ?

i was drying out .

you do n't even know me .

'fraid so .

this is it ? the whole vault .

it 's me . norther winslow .

i 've been working on this poem for 12 years .

wait ! i need those !

my father talked about a lot of things he never did , and i 'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about . i 'm just trying to reconcile the two .

were you and my father having an affair ?

how did you know my father ?

oh . oh .

what happened ?

i need you on my side .

do you love him ?

do you love your father ?

mmm , what . i know better than to argue romance with a french woman .

but it 's romantic .

i 'm going with you .

i suppose your grandmother 's house when she passed on . but we sold that right away . your cousin shirley bought it .

yes ?

mom ?

that really happened ?

yes , you both think william bloom is a very smart man . the problem is , you only see me as your mother , and not as someone 's wife . and i 've been his wife longer than i 've been your mother . you ca n't discount that .

yes . but that 's a different ...

yes , will , i do . and do n't presume things you do n't know .

mom , would you say you understand dad ?

you do n't talk about those things . not yet .

i 've been buying you stuff all week . i 've been buying him stuff all week .

you know what for .

no i have n't .

name it .

a baby ? what are we supposed to do with a baby ?

thank you .

yeah .

he wants a lot of money .

he wants money .

no . it 's not that .

she says she has a secret to tell .

no , no ...

so how long will you be in england ?

right . so i can say he smokes me . so .

i am actor , he is actor , although he is an actor stroke musician . i just noodle along , i 'm not so good . he makes me look like a retard -- he smokes me . i do n't mean he smokes me .

right .

so hang on . you 're both nadia 's cousins ?

toast first then we talk seriously , i can see you are serious about us .

and what ? you mean from the beginning ? jesus . can i uh okay , as we say in russia can i cut a long story short . okay . nadia is my little cousin . except she 's not . but we say cousin . this is for you .

and ...

yes . i know .

oh . we are russian .

i 'm asking what you 're here for .

sophia . hello sophia . mine 's still john .

no . what ? no . i know .

you did n't deserve me john buckingham .

i 'm quitting . this will be my last one . so . goodbye .

okay . promise ?

something else .

except for small eyes .

i do n't want anyone to die .

i do n't know why i said it . i 'm sorry .

have you had any before ?

i do n't have nothing .

fifteen . you do n't know him . he was very kind and strong .

what ? i ... i was n't saying ...

you know , in russia , there 's no work for women . it 's a different world .

you do n't understand you either .

you do n't want to talk about it .

i do n't want to talk about it .

excuse me ?

he will come back .

oh jesus .

so uh ...

so , uh , alexei , which i know is n't his name ...

i do n't have any money .

shut up . have you got your passport ?

where 's the restroom ?

in every sense . if at all possible .

i know you just want to punish me --

in the world .

they do n't blame you . when a bank employee does this they understand . you get your life back . anyway i bet you hated that bank .

so what are you going to do ?

they go .

they go .

what 's wrong ?

yes i know .

happy birthday . happy birthday .

i 'm sorry . it 's these soft shoes i wear for my back .

you seen my snake-skin shoes ?

hi .

some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume . so now they have scented creams . they help moisturize a woman 's skin . this one 's my favorite . it 's called ginger souffle . i recommend ... applying the cream while the skin is still damp . so ... perhaps just after a shower .

these are whipped body creams . it 's like a lotion .

well , that makes it easier .

and , sir ... do you have a size in mind for what you 're lookin ' for ?

make yourself at home . you done it already .

you had a plan ! you had a goddamn life ! and she just fucked the guts out of you !

with all she was doin ' . with all the shit she kept doing ! you stayed stuck to that bitch 's ass and you would n't let go .

i just been so mixed up lately , gill . and , you know , with her history , i can see how she could get scared ... ... and run .

she ever tell you she was thinkin ' of taking off ?

could you do somethin ' for me ?

still makin ' jokes ?

look it ... i put the goddamn dress on , did n't i ? i think i 'm handlin ' myself with some ... fuckin ' restraint here ... how you got me locked up like a dog on a ...

-- i should tear your head off .

it 's not regulation . and the only way you 're gon na stop anybody with it is to show it to him , and while he 's laughing , you can shove it down his throat .

joyce can be nice .

pussy , ass , soft personnel .

`` goodness , gracious , great balls of fire . '' to the killer . jerry lee lewis .

the mayor 's office , under the bed , the back room at lombardi 's . and call me ich .

no one 's keeping him here .

he killed a police officer .

how ? you do n't know the place . you do n't know the language . get on the plane .

they 're blaming it on you . christ , conklin , you did n't even tell me you lost the prisoner !

they said send a detective if i could spare one . i can always spare you .

what ?

yeah .

dope ?

-- do you know where she is , detective ? do you know how to find her ? even where to start ? we will find them .

your visa has expired . be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported .

seven years work by the finest engraver . mass produced , sequentially numbered . the best there has ever been , mr. conklin .

we 've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table .

can the maker repair what he makes ?

i 'm surprised you did n't come to me sooner .

here 's your check , my boy . thank you .

just thought i 'd ...

no .

he 's not really my friend . i just do a job for him now and then .

dr. tyrell ?

if we do n't find help soon , pris has n't got long to live .

of course not .

nexus - 6 .

what generation are you ?

you 're androids .

oh , no bother , i 'd be glad to .

very good , pris . now show him why .

when ?

okay , here it is . eldon tyrell , his family and half his staff were just massacred . the cat is about to get out of the bag . pressure is definitely on . the nexus program is terminated . when you finish there , locate nexus designated rachael and retire .

who .

yeah .

you got a machine on it yet ?

five . three nights ago one of them managed to break into the tyrell corporation . killed two guards and got as far as the genetic sector before he got fried going through an electro- field .

your customer , eh ?

nexus designated zhora : incept june 13th 2017 , athletic conditioning , highly competitive , special abilities in the entertainment field .

nexus designated pris : incept data december 13 2017 , competitive , programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers .

the umbrella .

and what in your estimation works ?

i think we 're through for the night .

what about a summary then .

the five in question are third generation nexus sixes , constructed of skin-flesh culture , selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought , para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program . are you with me ?

you like to kiss her goodbye .

how long you had these guys ?

ya .

hey , it 's okay . i like to pee . so how are you doing ?

but if you could ?

why did n't you go ?

nope .

your mind kept wandering . that bothered me .

during the road test ...

i did n't say that . your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time .

no rust ?

book the good ones for where ?

and who do i go to about you ?

hey ! do your job but do n't wreck mine , huh ?

jeezus !

have you ever known anybody a long time ?

but then how can you ...

it appears to be dirty -- why do n't you get somebody ?

yeah .

what do people do in the afternoon ?

not too good .

i am . part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out .

i told you i 'd come back .

they probably want to find out when they were made .

so ?

sounds like i 'm an ass-hole either way , but the answer is still no .

is there anything else ?

ugh .

you show the picture to your husband . he likes it and hangs it on the wall . the girl is lying on a bearskin rug .

you 're watching t.v . and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist .

for the responsibility of your power . being a police bureaucrat , you 've got more than your share .

it seems your department does n't believe out new unit is to the public benefit .

bad ?

all pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer , an esper 231 -- i believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced .

discreetly .

if she is , the machine works .

well ?

sitting next to you .

but in your profession that is a risk .

but i understand what you mean .

know what a turtle is ?

a tortoise . what 's that ?

maybe you 're fed up , maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows . so you look down and see a tortoise . it 's crawling towards you ...

but how come i 'd be there ?

does n't make any difference what desert -- it 's completely hypothetical .

what one ?

you 're in a desert , walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a ...

what makes you think so ?

i keep a lot of provisions right here .

beautiful .

you scared me .

what about friends ?

i do n't have one .

eve , i 'm sorry .

adam ? !

maybe . but that 's how it works .

that 's ridiculous .

okay . i like that .

how 'bout this one ?

yes , i have a dictionary . but i ca n't understand for the life of me why you would call her that ! or why cliff would say that about you .

i like her .

i thought i was here to meet women .

would you do it just because you 're my friend ? my very best friend .

yeah ? no kidding . listen , you still want to go girl hunting tonight ?

hey , eve !

yes !

you said it would be easy !

i told you i 've never driven before !

sorry !

the engine is still running .

of course .

could we talk about that a little later ?

when do you need her by ?

no dogs , huh ? okay .

i would n't know . what kind of wife are you looking for ?

it did n't used to be that way .

everybody 's divorced .

bites what ?

i do n't want to be alone .

a wife ?

well ... okay . i would like you to help me find a ... wife .

we 'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry .

night !

what ?

they like dr. pepper .

why not buy them milk or something -- instead of dr. pepper ?

sure .

i 've got to make at least a thousand a week .

why does it never work out ? you and ... men ?

what ?

see , ya .

hey , no kidding ? in color ?

no .

wait , eve , please ! wait .

let me guess something . this is your first visit to la la land . you 're staying somewhere over in hollywood because , like an idiot , you thought that would be an exciting place to stay . right so far ?

well , i guess because i 'm a little psychic ... i have this thing .

i came on a bus .

what 's wrong with you ?

a walking penis capable of intelligent speech . a dickhead .

are you french ?

what ?

is this because of the radiation ?

archbishop melker . we met earlier .

yes .

are you all right ?

uh , i think they have .

uh-huh .

that 's what everybody believes ?

it 's ukrainian . her grandparents immigrated here .

shit is a french word ?

these are really swell ! i mean swell !

no kidding !

your mom made that all by herself .

the nocturnal flying mammal ?

like a painting ?

it 's my entire baseball collection . it 's yours now .

latin exam , dad . it 's tuesday .

yes ! lying is always a very effective dating tool .

ladies first , troy ! that was close .

what ? !

almost all of them .

true .

he 's a windows guy then , huh ?

oh , yes . it would probably kill him .

that would knock my father out .

mt . mckinley . it 's also the highest point in north america .

how do you get through those winters ? well , you 're right . juneau . what 's the highest peak ?

who use to own it ?

she 's right ? !

goodnight .

good night ! sleep tight . do n't let the bedbugs bite ! that 's what my mom always says ... ... who i 'm really beginning to miss . i 'm sorry . it 's my first night away from home .

my father is a genius .

you could have a meat order that big delivered to your home .

help you ?

how do you do , ma'am .

whatcha looking at ?

hi .

no .

no , wait ! at least stay for dinner !

what ?

oh , adam , that would be wonderful if you could find a girl . one who 's not a mutant ... and hopefully comes from pasadena . nothing against valley girls , but in my day anyhow , the girls from pasadena , i do n't know ... always just seemed a little nicer .

i just hope this is still good up there .

oh . a nice one , i hope .

i was frightened and i did n't know what to think ! but you know-i believe him . i think he just wants to go home . wherever the hell that is ...

oh , my god !

good .

well , that 's ... considerably shorter than before . i was wondering , calvin , why set the locks at all . i mean the radiation is gone and ...

yes , dear , i know .

he 's smart .

no , calvin . we 're not going to make do . not me ! not adam . we 're going up no matter what ! we deserve it . even if it 's terrible !

for how long ? we 've just about run out of everything !

yes .

i do n't believe it !

others are ... multi-sexual . it seems ... they can be both masculine and feminine ... simultaneously .

it 's not a pretty sight . some eat out of garbage cans . others are ... cover your ears , son , and hum . i mean that literally and i mean right now !

mutants ? !

i 'm going to give it to you straight . there 's no point in beating around the bush . there were survivors . apparently , the fallout has created ... .a subspecies of mutants .

yes , yes it is !

oh , yes . it just fascinates me how all these things work .

in the generator room again ?

sure .

let 's eat our cake .

one who does n't glow in the dark .

oh , calvin , i 'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps ca n't be kept .

not bad for a three and a half year old ! i 'd like to see the public school system match that ! i do n't care how terrific it is !

jeffrey , honey . your father 's condition is serious . it 's going to cost so much . we just wo n't have the money to keep you in school . i 'm telling you this now , so that you can get your things together and check out of school , honey , or whatever you have to do , it 'll save you another trip back . you 're going to have to work at the store .

nice of you to offer , jeffrey , but certainly not . just relax and enjoy your coffee . i 'm sure sandy will be back soon .

no . no thank you .

yeah , i know .

oh , yes , jeffrey . come in . he 'll be back any minute now . you 're welcome to wait . is it urgent ?

i mean , some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered .

i mean , you do n't exactly have the build for a football . i mean , no offense .

uh-uh .

no . is detective gordon going to be at your house ?

take her to my house . my dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone . do you have anything to put around her ?

i like that idea , that 's a real good idea .

i should never had gotten you going on this . yes jeffrey . friday 's on !

you did n't tell him about me ?

yes . is that so surprising ? yeah i worry , a lot . i got you into this .

jeffrey ? why ?

oh yeah ?

shoot .

you want to go talk to him ?

what am i going to do ?

i 'm really sorry .

you were late .

okay , sandy .

so are you . i mean you 're a neat guy . we better get back .

yeah i guess so . you 're a neat girl .

yeah ?

yeah . i mean a little , you know .

yes .

actually . i 've been in twice .

you saw a lot in one night .

i do n't see how i can , and i ca n't prove any of this . i got all this information illegally . also it could get you in trouble .

you want to tell me about it ?

no way . i 'm about to blow up .

what 's with mike ?

well . maybe we should discuss this somewhere else , you know what i mean ?

what did you see ?

are you sure ?

oh , okay , can i call ?

i 'll drink to that .

two .

yeah , but do n't pick me up . my father may think it 's strange . i 'll walk over to your house . i 'll be there at eight o'clock .

i 'll tell mike i 'm sick . there 's a game tonight anyway and he 'll never miss me . afterwards he can go out with the guys . just so the record is kept straight though , i love mike . what do want me to do ?

yes . i do .

so , what 's next ?

thanks . dorothy vallens . okay , goodluck . three minutes , no sooner .

alright .

let 's just try the first part . if that goes well , we 'll see about the rest . no one will suspect us , because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this .

i do n't know , it sounds like a good daydream , but actually doing it is too weird . too dangerous .

you will be a jehovah 's witness . i have a few `` awake '' magazines for you . you do n't have to keep her very long . a few seconds is all i 'll need . whatiya think ?

what will i say when she comes to the door ?

alright . the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that i could crawl into later .

alright , now tell me . what is it ?

i guess mike 's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon .

i 'd like to talk to you about something .

i do n't know .

i guess i 'll see you sometime .

did they find out anything when they questioned her ?

that 's the building . she lives on the seventh floor . do n't stop to look long , the police are watching .

it 's a strange world is n't it ? do you know what building the woman lives in ?

maybe so .

am i bothering you ?

i just know , that 's all . i remember you from central .

sure , just a sec . excuse me .

i do n't know why we have to watch tv .

do n't start with your shit . do n't you talk to me . oh , hey uncle gussy , thanks for years of service . here 's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys ' shit eight hours a day . what am i , a retired bus driver ?

yes mother .

yes sir .

let him go or i will deliver you , right now .

look again for fuck sake !

what the fuck are you doing ?

meee ! me ! i 'm the guy ! i know everyone , their habits , where they hang out , who they talk to . i know where they fuckin ' live . we could kill everyone !

fuck , man ! i may as well have posted flyers . right out in public , man .

lakeview the deli ? oh , shit !

what did i fuckin ' do ? ... in the middle of the lakeview .

no , no . that 's just not the way things are done . besides , how 's he know i do n't just get in there see there 's too many and just serve em their fuckin ' food and beat it ?

you think they sold me out ? no way .

you sound real remorseful .

yes .

certainly illustrates the diversity of the word .

let 's do him right here .

poppa joe said there was only two . in and out . boy , you guys sure did a good job . you 're good , huh ? cool masks . where 'd you get them ?

all right , i suppose you have the right ta know .

come on , ma . out with it . who came out first ?

what ? ! what are you doin ' ?

i finally found your da 's army revolver , connor .

mother , what are you sayin ' ? you 're talkin ' crazy here .

be careful .

so you 're telling me it was one guy with six guns ? a-and he was a senior fucking citizen ?

well , we could try the bag over the head thing . walk you right out the front .

we paid attention in school .

you guys are not under oath , here . i am assuming you knew these two guys from before , huh ?

hold this shit for us , doc . we 'll be comin back for it when we get out .

what are you going to do ?

that 's the guy that got us off the hook with the `` checkov '' thing .

rocco , this is the real deal . we must kill without hesitation , without guilt or remorse . evil man , dead man .

so what do you think ?

yes .

where are you goin ' ? did you tell him ?

oh , we 're good man .

on tv ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch .

aye .

a bit .

i 'm serious .

i have no idea . maybe someone saw and talked .

do n't c-cross the road if ya ca n't get out of the kitchen .

i gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today .

oh , jesus .

how many ?

how many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb ?

aye .

that 's just fucking weird . i have no idea .

no . this guy is big time . these two are street-walking scum .

three .

can she i.d . them ?

that depends . you either do your job or get ethical .

and number three , dolly .

yeah , well ... i 'm an expert in name- ology .

holy shit . you 're the first one that 's ever got that .

i killed your fuckin ' cat , you druggie bitch !

crime of passion . he just went nuts . he would have shot everyone in here . he just ran out of bullets .

what ?

those doors were down ... which means this . they looked down in through the peep hole , saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside . pop , pop , pop , right through the glass . why ?

and is there an american , shit is there a man seated among us that has n't thought about it many times , let 's just put them all on an island , give them guns and let them kill each other . this is our wet dream come true . you can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law , then bury it from here on out .

yeah . some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead , or silver .

new hitman wants to leave his mark

and the pennies ?

so what are you thinkin ' here ?

why do n't you let me do the thinking , huh , genius ?

who were the victims ?

they were n't related . the guy used a 38. no pennies . totally amateur .

shit ! shit !

respect is earned , greenly , never given . guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table .

sweet-n-low !

that 's one big fuckin ' shoe ! ... and think about it . of all the ways to kill a guy , crushin ' him to death . that 's very particular . you do n't get many of those . i dunno . i feel something big here . i would n't be surprised if we see more of these turning up .

well you tell him ta take it easy with that . he 's got ta learn ta respect women the way connor does .

it 's only 11:00 here boys so i got lot 's more drinkin ' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the anvil .

i ...

we 'll keep going , roc .

we have to go now . we 're on the lamb .

i mean he ai n't here .

well , i 'm sold .

fine ! fuck it ! when we 're done she can i.d . me . i do n't care . just tryin ' to be professional , but no ...

liberating is n't it ?

you sure you killed them ?

yeah . anybody call for me ?

oh , jesus . you 're such a fuckin ' retard !

thank you , father , thank you . whatever . goodbye , amen .

the laws of god are higher than the laws of man .

you 're right .

it is easy to be sarcastic about religion . it is harder to take small hints from god , your feelings and listen to them ... to take a stand .

i guess not .

you feel ? a soul is what gives you feelings . happiness , guilt , right or wrong . it is a conduit through which the lord speaks to us . you felt that your answers would be here in the house of god today . you feel these men are necessary . the lord has spoken to you twice this day .

yes .

why have i come to a church ? i never have before . i guess i just ... felt i should .

y-yes my son .

just go !

do n't do this my son .

i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry . i did n't see .

continue the joke .

yeah . and uh , he 's pissed off . he says , `` why you crackers always got ta find my mother fuckin ' pot ? and he tells him he 's gon na grant all his three wishes but he 's gon na give all the black guys ...

the ... the funny man .

poppa joe , you want me to go now ?

i caught your show down at the velvet room at the holiday inn , loved it when you busted into viva las vegas .

well , it 's the funny man . give it here , package boy .

when we go through the next gate you 'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard .

dignan , i --

how big is it ?

you 're living on a sailboat ?

we 're not sure .

why ?

so is mr. henry going to come by and see me or anything ?

like amnesia .

i 'll get him .

come on .

wait for kumar .

stand by , bird dog .

not at all . the place is totally deserted .

any activity ?

ok. roger .

so do i .

he was a nice guy .

or i might end up with a broken nose .

shit , dignan .

no , dignan . this is n't --

he seems pretty good .

what 's hinckley cold storage ?

it 's big , anthony . real big . it 's called hinckley cold storage .

i want you to look at this .

applejack would of got him anyway . this was just the quicker way .

sure .

ah . couple days ago .

what are you going to do , get married ? have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats ! and go around scrubbing the --

her name 's inez . stop calling her the housekeeper .

$ 383 .

you ca n't just run home every time things get tough . first of all , we 've got enough dough to --

no one to back me up . now i have a good idea . so unless you come up with something better --

inez has a master key to all these rooms , does n't she ? does n't she ?

what ?

i do n't really feel like talking about it . the only thing i feel like is getting the fuck out of this place .

would of been nice .

we 're going over to this bar if you feel like going .

well , the world is a little bit colder today .

i did n't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself , dignan .

if you say so .

so when you were saying bob 's at the store and acting real surprised , that was just an act . you were just --

he told you and you let him do it .

he took his stuff . he 's gone . i should of seen this . i should of expected it . bob does n't have any character .

maybe he just went to the store .

they blamed my family for everything . they always said mr. langston saved anthony 's life .

bob ?

obviously . that 's a given .

which one was that ?

they do n't ?

jerry . and this is my associate cornelius .

hi .

no . we did n't .

dignan , i ca n't get my hair cut . that 's just not possible , all right ?

armored trucks are very difficult to steal , anthony .

i 'll say it .

you were spoiled rotten .

that 's real cool , anthony . yeah , i wore boots . my parents would n't buy me any $ 200 running shoes like yours . i was n't spoiled .

what about them ?

i do n't like to use that credit card , dignan .

like he meant it .

oh , shit . that was scary . in the middle of the robbery . the manager looks at me . right in the eye . and goes , i 'm going to remember you .

we got it . we got it .

unlock that door . check the aisles .

calm down . take a deep breath .

dignan , calm down .

no , dignan . it 's not your gun . it 's all of ours .

you think we 're going to be chased ?

ok. escape route . the most important thing you can have is an escape route . just in case somebody 's tailing us . or even chasing us , as the case may be --

is it back in ?

that 's not bad .

eight dollars .

holy shit . what 'd i tell you ?

i 'm lookout .

where are you going ?

i know about money , anthony . i know the value of money . plus the earrings are worth three times that .

but dignan , do you really know that much about rare coins ?

she 's an attractive older woman .

who knows ? that 's why i filed it down .

as part of his plan . i do n't know why .

yeah .

this is good .

bob . bob . that 's a palindrome . i love palindromes .

the fear of death , the pain of consciousness . did you mix this martini ?

yeah . i mean , i do n't think about it all the time . but once in awhile i kind of go , woah . man .

i do n't want to die .

i 'll tell you , anthony . times like this i get philosophical . what does it mean ? what 's it all about ? are you afraid to die ?

how 'd he do ?

yes , he did .

how does that feel ?

take a deep breath .

the abe henry double-cross test . you just made a perfect score .

you mean a safecracker ?

you mean like techniques ?

thanks .

who 's got the car keys ?

let me see it . did you drop it ?

nothing . i was just asking .

were you adopted , bob ?

yeah , but he still has the aggravation . three days sitting in a cell .

sixty days ?

it took six months of research . i did all the wiring myself . switched ac to dc . doubled the voltage . shorted out the generator . the whole school was shut down .

i know it must of been a bad experience . but it does n't sound like it was your fault .

no , i do n't mind .

cause i 'm not getting any better . it 's a waste of time .

let them fight .

could you grow cinnamon ?

but he 's got a loud bark . that 's the most important thing is a loud bark .

yeah . i 've stolen two cars before . one jaguar . and one trans-am . with t- tops . that trans-am was fun to drive .

future man . you know . cause he looks like he 's from the future .

future man .

cuba .

where 'd they come from ?

abdul-shabazz ?

uh-uh .

uh-uh .

did you ever hear of the s. cooper trust robbery ?

i hear you 're a good thief .

wait . did he see us ?

little richard . trust me . you 're insane . jesus , this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk . you do not want a guy like that loose on the streets .

here we go .

is he breathing ?

that 's ok .

you said 48 hours !

right . it was extremely stupid .

what 's his name ?

just get in the car , bob .

future man would never go to jail for you , i 'll tell you that .

goddammit , dignan ! it 's my car ! if you do n't give me my keys , i swear to god --

i ca n't do that , bob .

not in that car you 're not .

i 'm going back .

bob , that makes no sense .

well , obviously , we got to go back .

what do you mean get back ?

then how come they have n't set the bail yet ? that 's unconstitutional .

the cops say it 's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana .

that could be anybody 's .

i 'm sure he did . we 'll have to get new plates .

he would n't move .

no . all he 'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose .

you really think he 'll remember you ?

no . i was calm .

he electrocuted someone ?

he does n't get it . held never understand what we 're trying to accomplish here . it 's too dangerous for him .

i 'm paying attention . i just want to look at it for a minute .

ok .

i do blame you , bob . and woah . look at her .

as much as i want . when these plants bud i 'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed .

how much could you grow ? realistically .

i 'll just drive my car .

he looks like he was designed by scientists . for desert warfare .

so who 's going to know ?

not even for emergencies ?

i 'm not allowed to drive those .

i 'd appreciate it if you did n't go around telling people lies about me .

how you doing , bob ?

well , i think --

oh , yeah .

is he in ?

what 's the story ?

you got that ?

where is he ? where is rob ?

no . just pool .

si . tecate . you like to fight ?

she is a good looking woman .

where 's your friend ? he go with the chiquita ?

you a good pool player .

she chicano , yes ?

pleasure to meet you , john .

what do you mean ?

she 's done everything i wanted . she bit on conklin so fast it was laughable . she even found his bogus swiss account ...

no . the files are spotless . whatever they find , it 's just going to make conklin look worse .

i 'll say . you killed his goddam girlfriend instead . now they 're onto neski . they 're at the brecker hotel even as we speak .

well , you 're probably right . i guess that 's all that hubris is .

had to be done .

moscow ? what the hell 's he going to moscow for ?

what 's definitive , is that i just lost two people in berlin !

we were throwing money at him . throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark .

excuse me .

i want to know what happened .

that 's not gon na fly .

show me again ...

okay . what if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming conklin and bourne . what if bourne did n't have anything to do with this ?

jesus ...

there were two charges , they were supposed to go off simultaneously . the second one , the one that did n't go off , was down here ... first of all , this is nothing , it 's a sub-line for the breaker above . second , why put the charge all the way down here ? if you 're good enough to get in here and handle the gear , you 're good enough to know you do n't need this . bourne would know .

what do you have , danny ?

sir ...

i should kill you ... if it 's true you should die ... i should kill you now !

it does n't matter . your life is hard enough .

it was my job . my first time . your father was supposed to be alone . but then your mother , she came out of nowhere ... i had to change my plan . you understand me ? you do n't have to live like that anymore . thinking that .

yes ...

it changes things . that knowledge . does n't it ?

what ?

i would want to know . i would want to know that my mother did n't kill my father . i would want to know that she did n't kill herself .

-- my coat -- but we should --

how long ? how long do i have --

i 'm sorry .

pamela landy ?

who sent you to greece ?

shot dead in paris . dead the night you walked out .

i like it here . last time i saw you was greece . you had a good spot .

sorry . old habits .

drop it .

i know it 's a dream .

-- it 's just him ? --

-- not yet --

you drive .

that 's crazy .

so ...

but we were so careful .

no ... how ?

sleep . sleep now .

i 'm trying , marie , okay ?

you 're sure ? we should still -- we should write it down .

no . there 's nothing new .

that 's a lie !

so when was i here ?

conklin ! stuff on conklin !

what was landy buying ? what kind of files ? what was she buying ?

i left a fingerprint ! you fucking people .

it was pamela landy 's op . the guy was going to sell-out a mole or something . i have n't been debriefed on exactly what it was .

a russian ?

i want to hear it from you .

how do they know that ? how can they know any of that ?

is she running treadstone ?

who is pamela landy ?

why you 're alive ? you 're alive because you 're special . because she kept you alive . because we want you back on our side .

sounds like a threat .

are you disappointed ?

why am i alive ?

i want to come in .

but we can relax . we tracked him . he 's on a train to moscow .

this stays between you and i. we finally have an edge . i do n't want to lose it .

-- who ? -- who else is here ? --

this is everything ? is there .

yes , sir -- ma'am ...

felt promising . it 's a start .

i do n't know . he was sick . he wanted out . i believed him .

what do you think ? is he coming in ?

it 's got caffeine in it . that 's all i know .

is it fresh ?

and why is that ?

these were killers . conklin had them all jacked up . they were dobermans .

if you say so .

and what about you , anything ?

are we locked up ?

no . munich 's a bust . he 's loose .

anything ?

they 've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of god 's church , and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation . so please -- do it .

saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans , with outlawed pipes , playing outlawed tunes .

sir william . we come to seek a meeting .

longshanks promised !

he wo n't come .

the crown is that of scotland . and scotland is william wallace .

impossible . how dare you bring a panicky lie .

before he lost his powers of speech , he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know wallace was dead .

you fancy him .

i am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries . all of england shudders with the news of renewed rebellion .

yes . i had thought that ... i was loathsome to you . perhaps i am . if i may be excused , m'lord .

no . one of us is enough .

my dreams of marion are gone . i killed them myself . if i knew i could live with her on the other side of death , i 'd welcome it .

your dreams are n't about freedom ! they 're about marion ! you have to be a hero , because you think she sees you ! is that it ?

we 've lived a dream together . a dream of freedom !

that 's just a dream , william !

we 're here to stay . we do n't care to live , if we ca n't fight beside ya .

hamish , i ... thank ...

i will not .

i still say this is no test . a catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can .

test of manhood .

three , maybe more !

all right , father , i 'll ask him ! if i risk my neck for you , will i get a chance to kill englishmen ?

my greatness is better demonstrated with this .

no . i have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war .

he waits . for you . he says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him .

then why does he stay ? my scouts say he has not advanced .

if he wants his queen to rule , then you stay and learn how ! i will deal with him .

i sent for him -- and the little coward send you ? !

your pardon , m'lord , he asked me to come in his stead .

never , in my whole life , did i swear allegiance to your king --

treason . against whom ?

... tonight !

my parents are growing suspicious ! i ca n't keep meeting you every night !

i 've missed you .

this night is too beautiful to have again .

nor i !

i want ... to marry you !

some nights . i have dreams . mostly dreams i do n't want . i started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when i did sleep i 'd dream only of the ride and the adventure .

thank you for accepting .

your father does n't like me , does he ?

ah , oui ! englishmen do n't know what a tongue is for .

last night i slept with a member of the war council .

when the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes . scotland is in chaos . your husband is secretly sending an army north .

i can not love you for the sake of revenge .

that is not possible .

wife of edward , the king 's son ?

i must ... consult with my father .

i 'm no coward ! i want what you want ! but we need the nobles .

no . but from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself . its nobles share allegiance with england and its clans war with each other . if you make enemies on both sides of the border , you 'll end up dead .

and the common man who bleeds on the battlefield , does he risk less ?

fine speech . now what do we do ?

of course . there is one more thing , mrs. treborn . and i feel bad for mentioning it ...

what is it ?

actually , these tests were n't available twenty years ago .

a journal . just have him write down everything he does .

hold it , hold it , andrea . let 's not jump to conclusions . i 'll run some preliminary tests , see what we can rule out .

how . did you . know that ?

what does that mean for evan ?

okay , doc . what 's the damage ? how much time have i got ?

how 's kayleigh doing ? she all right ?

and then , just before it got so bad that he had to be committed , he said that he could ...

i ca n't help it . i 'm just so proud of you . you 've got the highest grades in all of your classes .

please , mom . people will talk .

my father has a bad memory , too ?

we 've been over this a hundred times . it 's too dangerous for him .

darn it !

marks , scars , i dunno . anything could happen i guess .

jesus himself could n't make me take on the brotherhood . when they come , just put your mind in another place , man . be somewhere else .

are you sure ? not even with my father ?

i ca n't ... the car vanishes and all of a sudden i 'm on the ground in the woods .

i see a car .

where are you now ?

hello , evan . it 's very nice to meet you . he 's as handsome as his father .

sorry , dude . just figured it 'd be okay with you bein ' sick and all .

shhh ! i need quiet for this .

that 's probably why hannibal lecter 's so smart .

just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure , it gets all of the worm 's memories .

like ozzy .

when my folks split , they gave me and tommy a choice who we wanted to live with . i could n't stand my dad , but i knew if i moved to my mom 's i 'd never see you again .

kayleigh ? do you ever think about `` us ? '' i mean , wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us ?

he saved mrs. halpern ? please , the twisted fuck .

where are we going ?

do n't think i 'll need it where i 'm going .

that i did n't leave you there to rot .

i could n't give a shit if you believe me or not , and frankly i 'm too tired to prove it to you .

i 'm the only person you 've told ? that 's a great line . does that make other girls swoon ? do they actually eat up this bullshit ?

what 's happened to you ?

no . just that you need to hurt me with it . i 've been where you 've been .

i get it . you can drop it now .

so how 's tricks ? sorry , occupational humor .

nice to see you , too . can i come in ?

evan . stop it . it 's not the time .

wait . something 's not right . is n't that your jacket ?

what do you mean ?

do n't give me this oprah-book club bad upbringing shit , because you turned out fine .

why are you doing all this for me ?

what do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect ? like , looking back , whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after i moved away ?

hey , uh , do n't go freaking out on me over this , but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera ?

just shut up , evan . you 're wasting your breath .

no , but i think something really bad might 've happened to us .

well , sure . i 'll try to remember . shoot .

they kept him in juvy for a few years . now he works over at dale 's autobody .

god , evan ! i never thought i 'd see you again . how 've you been ?

what are you talking about ? what you deserve is a better brother and father . all they do is make you feel like shit .

i deserve a lot worse .

you really do n't remember anything that happened ?

and i 'll tell the child protective services about your kiddie porn endeavors . one step closer and i 'll shove this up your ass !

... yes .

who -- who are you ?

it 'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father . ultimately , it 'll lead to her suicide . nice work , daddy .

wrong answer , fuckbag . this is the very moment of your reckoning . in the next thirty seconds you 're going to open one of two doors . the first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood .

who 's to say you ca n't make things better ?

but it did n't . and now i need info to make things right again and you 're the only one who can give it to me .

uh-huh . mom says i have your eyes and your --

me neither .

we 'll find out soon enough .

remember , everyone ! only two weeks until your science projects are due .

oh , fine i guess . it 's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up , so i have n't ...

typical psych major . a complete wise ass . and how 's your project coming ? still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation ?

i 'm not sure . i might have gotten some stories mixed up . did pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts ?

it was like tommy was possessed or something . there was a hate in his eyes that i could n't really call human .

you 're kidding . he 's so ... big .

uh , we should be getting to class now .

drop it or i 'll slit your mother 's throat in her sleep .

can ... can ... can i have this ?

i think i 'll go check out the chapel .

oh goody , nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of hava nagila til i puke .

get this `` us '' shit . as if i was gon na lay a hand on my own sister . you 've done nicely for yourself , evan . nice friends , nice life , not to mention you 're fucking my sister . not a bad piece of ass if i say so myself .

hold your horses , man . it 's here somewhere . i saw it when i was a kid .

none taken . hey , uh , does kayleigh miller still work here ?

shut up , tommy !

lenny ? come on !

wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted . you see the way evan 's mom was looking at you ?

just blow something up ? are you nuts ? there 's an art to mass destruction . would you just paint the mona lisa ? no . besides , we 're here already .

you are , silly . he 's a bad sheriff .

i thought i was the bad guy !

maybe it went out . should someone check it ?

the hell you are n't . anyone of us does it , you 'll puss out and narc for sure .

does he know that ?

he did . captain renault did .

how did you get in here ? you 're under age .

yes ?

as you see , it was true every single time . thank heaven i found you , berger . i am looking for a man by the name of ugarte . he is supposed to help me .

mr. berger , the ring , could i see it again ?

i 'm sorry . it is .

good .

yes , sir .

i will . then i am going to the meeting of the --

oh , thank you , herr rick . sacha will be happy to hear it . i owe him money .

monsieur rick !

that 's all right .

-- forget it , emil . mistakes like that happen all the time .

i 'd better be going .

i shall remember to pay it ... to myself .

well , so long .

well , you 're in good company . renault and strasser probably think so , too .

and the carrying charges ?

so could i. and i 'm a poor businessman .

if i could lay my hands on those letters , i could make a fortune .

practically no one .

carrying charges , my boy , carrying charges . here , sit down . there 's something i want to talk over with you , anyhow .

i never drink in the morning . and every time you send my shipment over , it 's always just a little bit short .

hello , ferrari . how 's business at the blue parrot ?

it was gracious of you to share it with me . good day , mademoiselle , monsieur .

rick ?

those letters were not found on ugarte when they arrested him .

it is possible the french authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here .

uh huh . under a safe conduct from me .

maybe not today , maybe not tomorrow , but soon , and for the rest of your life .

but richard , no , i , i --

-- last night we said a great many things . you said i was to do the thinking for both of us . well , i 've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing . you 're getting on that plane with victor where you belong .

but it 's all right , is n't it ? you were able to arrange everything ?

all right , i will . here 's looking at you , kid .

i ca n't fight it anymore . i ran away from you once . i ca n't do it again . oh , i do n't know what 's right any longer . you 'll have to think for both of us , for all of us .

oh , you 'll help him now , richard , wo n't you ? you 'll see that he gets out ? then he 'll have his work , all that he 's been living for .

when did you first find out he was alive ?

oh , it was n't my secret , richard . victor wanted it that way . not even our closest friends knew about our marriage . that was his way of protecting me . i knew so much about his work , and if the gestapo found out i was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me .

if laszlo and the cause mean so much to you , you wo n't stop at anything . all right , i 'll make it easier for you .

-- all right . i tried to reason with you . i tried everything . now i want those letters . get them for me .

i 'm not fighting for anything anymore , except myself . i 'm the only cause i 'm interested in .

you can ask any price you want , but you must give me those letters .

all the same , someday you 'll lie to laszlo . you 'll be there .

you can believe that if you want to .

last night i saw what has happened to you . the rick i knew in paris , i could tell him . he 'd understand . but the one who looked at me with such hatred ... well , i 'll be leaving casablanca soon and we 'll never see each other again . we knew very little about each other when we were in love in paris . if we leave it that way , maybe we 'll remember those days and not casablanca , not last night .

it does n't matter .

huh ! you understand how i feel . how long was it we had , honey ?

no . no , rick . not tonight .

oh , darling !

all right . at a quarter to five . say , why do n't we get married in marseilles ?

no , no , no , no . we must leave .

but be serious , darling . you are in danger and you must leave paris .

was that cannon fire , or is it my heart pounding ?

it 's the gestapo . they say they expect to be in paris tomorrow .

why there is no other man in my life ?

yes ?

a franc for your thoughts .

who are you really ? and what were you before ? what did you do and what did you think ? huh ?

yes . i put that dress away . when the germans march out , i 'll wear it again .

play it , sam . play `` as time goes by . ''

leave him alone , miss ilsa . you 're bad luck to him .

does he always leave so early ?

yes , ma'am .

some of the old songs , sam .

when i was in the concentration camp , were you lonely in paris ?

ilsa , i --

ask me ?

to tell you the truth , i am frightened too . shall i remain here in our hotel room hiding , or shall i carry on the best i can ?

what happened with rick ?

and as far away from major strasser as possible .

goodnight .

i will , do n't worry .

this time they really mean to stop me .

you are very kind .

i 'm afraid major strasser would insist .

here it is .

i understand .

yes .

i 'm going to anyway , because it may make a difference to you later on . you said you knew about ilsa and me .

i brought the money , monsieur blaine .

you love her that much ?

yes , rather .

thank you .

well , this might come in handy .

there is . i suggest that you ask your wife .

i appreciate it , but i do n't accept it .

are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs ?

is n't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog ?

my friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record . you ran guns to ethiopia . you fought against the fascists in spain .

my office .

go ahead .

monsieur blaine , i wonder if i could talk to you ?

i take that as a great compliment to sam . i suppose he means to you paris of , well , happier days .

good evening .

signor ferrari is the fat gent at the table .

any time .

we 'll come again .

what for ?

i believe you have a message for him ?

yes .

-- thank you .

i was in a german concentration camp for a year . that 's honor enough for a lifetime .

very well .

no . please , monsieur , it is a little game we play . they put it on the bill , i tear the bill up . it is very convenient .

thank you . i hope you 'll forgive me , captain , but the present french administration has not always been so cordial . may i present miss ilsa lund ?

yes . what is it you want ?

monsieur laszlo , is it not ?

good day .

do n't be in such a hurry . you have all the time in the world . you may be in casablanca indefinitely ... or you may leave for lisbon tomorrow , on one condition .

not at all . captain renault 's signature is necessary on every exit visa . captain , would you think it is possible that herr laszlo will receive a visa ?

i should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil .

i 've never accepted that privilege , and i 'm now on french soil .

victor laszlo is on that plane .

my dear major , we are trying to cooperate with your government , but we can not regulate the feelings of our people .

perhaps .

you were n't always so carefully neutral . we have a complete dossier on you .

how about new york ?

good evening , gentlemen .

you think of everything , do n't you ?

that is my least vulnerable spot .

i do . we 've got plenty of time to discuss that later .

i suppose you know what you 're doing , but i wonder if you realize what this means ?

put that gun down .

have you taken leave of your senses ?

oh , he wo n't be followed here .

it certainly would . germany ... vichy would be very grateful .

you did n't come here to tell me this . you have the letters of transit . you can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please . why are you interested in what happens to laszlo ?

huh ?

well , they 're all excellent reasons .

well , i forgive you this time . but i 'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde , and it will make me very happy if she loses . uh huh !

as i suspected , you 're a rank sentimentalist .

that was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon . we just barely got cleaned up in time to open .

another precedent gone . this has been a very interesting evening . i 'll call you a cab . gasoline rationing , time of night .

oh , no , rick never --

well , you were asking about rick and here he is . mademoiselle , may i present --

maybe . well , it seems you are determined to keep laszlo here .

louis , whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape ?

i think not . i have seen the lady . and if he did not leave her in marseilles , or in oran , he certainly wo n't leave her in casablanca .

why two ?

done . no matter how clever he is , he still needs an exit visa , or i should say , two .

make it ten . i am only a poor corrupt official .

twenty thousand francs says it is n't .

his escape .

manages what ?

yeah ? what 's his name ?

thank you . rick , there are many exit visas sold in this cafe , but we know that you have never sold one . that is the reason we permit you to remain open .

i stick my neck out for nobody .

if you are thinking of warning him , do n't put yourself out . he can not possibly escape .

my health . i came to casablanca for the waters .

hello , louis .

take your hands off me !

rick , i 'm sick and tired of having you --

hello ?

good evening , mr. blaine .

in this case , you have no sympathy for the fox , huh ?

it 's not particularly my beloved paris .

what is your nationality ?

but think of all the poor devils who can not meet renault 's price . i get it for them for half . is that so parasitic ?

no .

thank you . will you have a drink with me please ?

hello ugarte .

uh , excuse me , please . hello , rick .

and getting closer every minute . here . drink up . we 'll never finish the other three .

this sort of takes the sting out of being occupied , does n't it , mr. richard ?

well , i do n't think i can remember it .

you played it for her and you can play it for me .

i bet they 're asleep in new york . i 'll bet they 're asleep all over america .

sam , if it 's december 1941 in casablanca , what time is it in new york ?

yeah , boss ?

please , boss , let 's go . ai n't nothing but trouble for you here .

sorry .

he 'll double what i pay you .

i like it fine here .

nobody remembers that .

you ca n't make it .

then we 've just got shit .

it 's real .

shut up .

yeah , sure , what ?

that 's death knocking , knocking on your door . crazy little woman come knocking , knocking at my front door ...

use the sail for a sea anchor and you wo n't move .

why do they have to die for me ?

take it , damn it .

you 've had today 's water .

with what ? there 's nothing to fix it with . this rope comes undone , you 're going to drown .

stay calm , identify the problem . problem , rope fraying . solution , fix rope .

save some for tomorrow .

no . that was the last one .

do you ... have any more packages to deliver ?

he was a sorry sonofabitch , and i 'm sorry i ever married him .

well , i do a little drawing --

hmmm . feels like it might have gotten wet .

okay . sure .

you came on a bicycle ? no wonder it 's so late .

i 'm so glad you 're alive .

you too .

not when you have no choice .

your calendar , your cell phone , your whoo pig sooey hat , some pictures of that ketch you wanted .

yeah , well ... could n't be helped .

her name 's hannah .

if i 'd known you were alive --

right back , you said you 'd be right back .

i 'm sorry ... i 'm sorry ...

go on . we 'll be fine . i 'll feed jango to the frogs .

a week , max . okay ? okay ?

chuck , you 're breaking my heart .

i guess i had n't thought through how i felt .

we 're a little emotional here . it 's christmas , maybe we 're over-reacting .

i have to .

you did ?

you know , for when you travel .

and for you --

merry christmas eve .

got to follow the paper path here .

and how was your christmas ?

i need the latest pdrs on st. petersburg .

well , when that iv runs out , you 're through with us . just the dentist tomorrow .

if you say you are .

you 're chuck noland .

sure .

you 're not out of pascagoula , are you ?

true enough . no sacred chickens nowhere , so far as i know .

but chickens ?

i wanted to come here .

there 's settled folks , and there 's nomads . you 're just not a settled folk . you never belonged here .

it seemed like she had such a good time last time .

mom , meet jango .

kamal is not here . we are very defused .

thanks . for everything .

i need to do it .

that 's what it 's about .

what ?

digital laser readers .

that 's all there is .

to life . fuck 'em if they ca n't take a joke .

hallelujah .

this is amber . her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack .

hello .

i beat the odds !

ninety five percent ? just give me the money now .

a hundred rubles st. petersburg hits 95 percent in a month .

i 'm trying to help you here . there 's warsaw , there 's this --

for the third time .

i 'm from arkansas . tell me a story with robert e. lee in it and maybe i 'll pay attention .

you know general mclelland , he would n't attack unless he had everything just right . finally abe lincoln came to him and said , general , if you 're not going to use my army , could i borrow it for a while ? so he gave it to grant and grant just said , let 's go .

forget it .

i 'm touched .

it was fifteen minutes late .

great . terrific . the good guys won one for a change .

how 'd it go ?

as it happens , i 'm headed for frisco myself .

permission to come aboard , sir .

we all know who trained homer -- his credentials are as good as mine are . do n't you be holy to me about the *law* ! what has the law done for any of us here ?

just find him some clothes , wilbur . he could use some clothes .

some new *things* would be useful . i do n't need any `` new help . ''

they just want you to hire some new help .

i was !

i doubt it . she 's just an ...

sometimes i want to meet them so i can kill them . just sometimes .

and that i can drive a truck !

uh ... i 'd like to show them that i can cook , a little .

i 'm *not* a doctor !

i 'm *not* a doctor . i have n't been to medical school -- i have n't even been to high school !

he *sniffs* that ether ! i 've seen him do it !

it 's gettin ' late . i think i 'll pack it in .

i 'm sorry for what i said about wally needing you . it was ... unnecessary .

sure . thanks .

and now that wally 's coming back , and because he 'll certainly *need* you ...

please ... that 's enough . i *loved* you , too -- you know i did .

no , that 's not it -- i just want to be sure i understand you .

what do you want me to *do* ?

i know , i 'm sorry .

stop it ! just cut it out !

no , do n't -- that 's something . nothing is nothing . do n't even look at me . i want ...

no . nothing is nothing . i want wally to come home . i 'm afraid to see him , too .

we 've got to keep her away from that bastard !

i told her ! she does n't feel she can do that . something about her father not letting her go anywhere ...

i 'm just waiting and seeing . like you said .

*what* will be okay ?

it will be okay .

just tell me . do you want me to go ? do you want me to stay ?

the *speaker* . for the movie sound .

sometimes ... movies mostly bore wally .

i did n't say that . growing up in an orphanage , you 're always lonely . you 're just never alone .

she was torn apart ! she died of a broken heart .

she *did* love him ! how many women have you known ?

`` king kong '' . it 's really good .

yes ! i 've only seen one , though .

sure ... i 'll see you around .

i guess i 'll see you around the orchards . thanks for everything .

i understand .

i ca n't have a baby alone . i do n't even know if he 's coming back !

really ?

i 've never seen a lobster .

no . it ai n't muddy . muddy 's just ...

i do n't need no more clothes , thank you .

you 've been giving him a *flying* lesson !

i was just showing homer the orchards ... kind of a geography lesson .

i love you , wally .

well , they are n't .

that 's true .

he probably does n't make much money picking apples -- he must have had to pay to send them , too .

she 's dead now , too . she was a nanny .

it 's almost like flying .

yes . they pick fruit , all kinds . they travel up and down the coast with the seasons . the trick to mr. rose is , you have to let him be the boss .

where are you going ?

sure ! be glad to ! uh ... a ride where ?

so , now , uh ... you 're not ... i mean , do *you* do the --

there 's more than one laceration , more than one cut .

if that was your knife , muddy , i wan na thank you for givin ' it to her -- no girl should be goin ' *hitch-hikin'* if she do n't got a good knife with her .

okay . then you can be of use .

one cervical stabilizer , two sets of dilators -- douglas points . one medium- sized curette , one small ; one medium speculum , one large ; two vulsellum forceps .

what 's that ? what 's it called ?

you 're lying . how can you ... with your own daughter !

i did n't see where you was pickin ' this mornin ' , homer , but you musta worked up a big appetite . you look like you 're serious about gettin ' to your lunch today !

stop it , homer . they are n't our rules . we did n't write them . i do n't see no reason to read them .

right .

it 's your heart -- you ought to take it with you .

i was n't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless -- i expect i 'll find some ways to be of use .

i 'm happy i amuse you .

i thought it was my turn .

you do it then .

nobody 's named this one yet .

where 's the name sheet ?

i do n't know it .

it 's obviously an aborticide .

there 's not a lot of work in the winter , and you 'll have to tolerate vernon -- even wally despises him , and wally likes everyone .

that 's *it* ?

rose , listen -- do n't *do* anything . you know , i mean to yourself . please listen ...

why do n't you just go back to your pickin ' , homer ? i can take care of it myself !

rose , please listen . whatever you want to do , i can help you .

i guess you must like watchin ' me be sick ...

oh , i suppose you is a doctor , homer ?

i 'm not in trouble .

that just ai n't right , jack -- your cigarette 's gon na end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider ! that ai n't right .

who cares ?

four weeks or so , right around halloween .

when will he be home , major ?

because the crew thought he 'd gone down with the plane . they were hospitalized for almost a week in china before they were flown back to india . it was n't until that they sorted through their gear ...

when the plane was hit , the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together . the copilot jumped third . all on captain worthington 's orders -- the captain was still flying the plane . none of the men of the ground could see the sky -- that 's how thick the jungle was . they never saw the plane crash -- they never *heard* it crash . they never saw captain worthington 's parachute , either .

then you pickin ' 'em too fast -- they ai n't no better than drops to me . see that bruise , and that one ? *half* of these is bruised ! look at this one ! it ai n't got no stem ! you might as well *step* on 'em , too -- they only good for cider .

you all take care of yourself , too , homer !

that 's right . i know you understand how i feel , homer -- you is breakin ' them rules , too . ai n't that right ?

well , muddy , we can look at all these angry stars homer 's been readin ' to us about .

you ai n't goin ' nowhere in the middle of the night , girl !

you got ta let me go , daddy . please ...

you just stay out of trouble , homer !

you ever see a palm tree , homer ?

yeah , that cigarette ai n't hard to find when you 're properly undressed .

that candy -- she 's the nicest girl i know !

so , what do you do ?

oh god . i 'm overbearing and rude . lily . lily finn .

my name 's grant . grant ashby .

same thing with playing a con . you have to be able to see that deep .

you 're worried about recouping the loan . i already told you .

and you have this letter of intent ?

right . the guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the valley do . they get a good idea , shop it around , raise some capital , then sell it off to a bigger company . microsoft , intel , oracle , whatever . the beauty of it is , they 've pretty much sold the company before they 're even real . the bigger company is already set to buy it , all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works . so they get some start up capital , make it work , then sell it for like five times the initial loan .

listen , what i 'm about to tell you , i 'm telling you in confidence , okay ? have you ever heard of a company called big.com ?

banks need to know how they 're going to get their money back .

uh , right ... and that was it . that 's when we decided to start our own business . no more shithead bosses .

it 's alfonse . i want to settle up . i have n't been ducking you . i told you i 'd get it .

guess so .

probably safe in the hands of the federal government .

alright ... turn around . she does n't get shit , unless i get that money . where is it ?

alrlght , alrlght . what happened today ?

we were back on .

yes it is , jake ! yes it is ! they were right there for you . she was right there for you ! look at her !

i was doing it for them .

you know when the first con was ever played ? it was when adam fell for eve in the garden of eden .

my father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy . the same numbers everyday for sixteen years . one day he gets pissed off , tells them he 's out and plays his own numbers . they hit the lucky seven for one point two million .

she had you tempting fate .

luck 's a funny thing . especially the bad .

thanks . did you know you should n't light three cigarettes with a match ?

he 's just as crooked as the next guy . you 'd think he 'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars .

grifters ...

your life flashing before your eyes ?

the anti-christ ?

and i think it 's because of this redhead ...

ten is standard , sir .

and how much did you say you wanted for this ... what did you call it ? a finder 's fee ?

we 'll take care of it .

let 's see ... let 's suppose he gets to customs and he gets caught . we get our money back , but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation . i do n't much like that idea . then again , let 's suppose he actually gets through customs . now , that 'll be something . we recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud . we double our money .

i got ta work off some of this adrenaline . i got a line on this pawn shop guy over in brooklyn . anybody want in ?

fuck that . we 're going too .

big al gets whacked mid-egg foo young . the whole thing took about two and a half hours . that 's how good he is .

what are you ? new ? let me tell you how good this guy is . last night , al calls this bookie to settle up . apparently he 's been ducking him for like a month . so the guy asks him where he 's got all this money all of a sudden , right ? what does al do ? does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking bar mitzvah bond ? does he tell him he 's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop ? no ... he starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some wall street asshole-type ... how he fleeced .

independent . same shit , just independent . they call him the king pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book ... big . fat . bald .

who 's that ?

let 's go , jake ?

what ? no . use the bathroom on the plane !

you ever use the bathroom in kennedy ?

jake --

and all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow .

so then miles walks straight into the creative director 's office and says `` the code 's fine , the program 's for shit '' and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy 's desk !

she up for this ?

you laugh now , but wait until you need a clean place to powder . this is new york city , sister . public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda . you know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob ? let 's do the list ... hepatitis , influenza , the flesh eating disease --

we meet him with corporate papers , inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital . the corporate papers are in order , but we need things to happen fast . our guy fudges numbers in the right places , moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom , depending upon what we need .

we only owe the king a hundred and fifty .

yes , her . where 's my wallet ?

it gets worse . now i know why he was such a good rope . i mean , cash ... that much and we never had to put him on the `` send ? '' turns out this ducking moe was an accountant for the king pin .

what ? i can feel you looking at me .

look at you , you skinny prick .

nothing ventured , nothing gained .

what do you need from me ? permission ? go ! if you can fleece him for two million , then do it , kid .

you know , back in the day , grafting was considered a gentleman 's racket . good suits , good food ... the underworld of the underworld . a grifter had to survive on his wits , his instincts ... i like that . i like the idea of that . these days , things being what they are , guys like me got ta stay low . it 's all take , take , take . you ca n't just be fucking witty about it .

minus one .

here and there , scooter ? here and there like boston , chicago , houston ? the bay area ? some action in london , 'til it turned nickel and dime . or how about that little stint down in miami ? heard you actually got into some trouble with the feds down there . you guy 's pretty good ?

kennedy . international terminal . gordo with a black suitcase . you got moonan under control ?

good boy .

something stupid .

oh yeah . moonan . i remember now . thanks .

that tip not work-out for you fellas ?

yeah well , sobo 's kid needs braces .

what are you talking about ? ten 's standard .

listen to me ! we do n't have much time . we can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me !

y-y-you fucking shot him ! that 's what happened !

i lost my head . i 'm ... sorry . i do n't know what happened .

your friend , big al ? it should have been you .

what about the money ?

everyone 's working an angle , right ?

no . you trusted him ... you were just getting square .

did , uh ... did you kill him ?

shit , what was that guy 's name ? i really liked him .

then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor , that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off . he said he was going to `` fuck some sense into me . ''

he was looking out for you .

you want to talk about an old boyfriend right now ?

what ?

you have really soft hands . like a baby 's .

so that was my part ? smile and shake my ass ?

i 'm good at it . lying , cheating , manipulating ... i 'm good at it .

it 's what i do . it 's my job .

for what ? a couple hundred bucks ?

off the record , i 'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it 'd help .

you just put a mother of a jinx on us .

he 's gone .

honey , this is mr. lewis . carolyn lewis 's father . mr. lewis , this is my wife , lily .

what ?

take a deep breath . you sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something .

you get an equal cut .

gee thanks . now i do n't have to find that bridge to jump off .

but the best part was that he could n't find gordo ! he was in the bathroom . so he finally goes in there , kicks in a stall door and starts yelling ! and there 's gordo , pants at the ankles , holding a pc world magazine !

where the hell is she ?

it never worked before because a , they did n't flush the bank enough ; b , their corporate papers were for shit ; c , they did n't have someone on the inside with customs .

breasts .

you better hurry . the police will be here any second . i do n't really understand my motivation with this . why am i washing glasses ?

meet me at my place later .

i was supposed to meet him for breakfast . he likes that new ihop they just opened , you know ... he likes to order that thing . the rutti- tutti-fresh and fruity thing they got .

you better get over to al 's . now .

then shut up .

with identification .

a ring for my wife . a lot like that one . in fact , it was that one .

you 're sure ? this is ... just a complete disaster .

no offense , but i 've seen you fight . you got ta be kidding m-

what ?

what 's up with you ? bladder infection ?

what 'd he say ?

point is , you do n't go through with this , he 's going to go after you next . and he do n't even like you , jake .

point , lupus . give us a point .

your buddy . that fat guy . the king could n't wait to have that guy whacked . he did n't even know who the guy was , but he was so pissed off at him , he gets him drilled . it ai n't personal . it 's business .

my fucking heart bleeds .

do n't worry , i 'll settle up with your boss . we have n't skipped town yet .

i can handle it .

ca n't say .

huh ? oh . she 's alright .

pretty much .

what are we gon na do with this stuff anyway ? heroin ? what the hell do you do with heroin ?

we got a good thing going here . you want to blow it over an overbite ?

confidence . it 's just confidence .

what ?

we 're here .

did he buy it ?

if you feds are so hot for him , why do n't we just bring him in right now ?

that 's what i 'm talking about .

it 's just insurance .

i do n't trust anybody . you see how bad this guy wants vig ? it 's like a sickness . i say we collar vig ourselves . we got vig , then we got leverage . and we trade ; vig for that tape . i want to see it right in front of my face .

it 's cosmetic . they do n't cover cosmetic . last year i had a tooth capped . the dentist tells me i 'm not covered for caps . it 's cosmetic .

do n't be an idiot . how hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer 's drugs to another drug dealer ? if vig 's right , we might be looking at a hundred , maybe a hundred fifty grand ...

ouch .

now he 's a real shit . do n't get friendly with him . i 'm sure he 's got his hand in the till . you know what he said to me once ? `` i want to fuck the whole world over . that 's my mission . '' the shit !

i 've been watching you work . you 're the best in the place . but you know that .

i can imagine .

it 's the tension .

goodnight .

jack . do you need a ride ?

hi , jack . welcome to the cesspit .

what 's the blue book price ?

not entirely .

good night ?

good god , no . but with skill like that , what do you want a job for ? you do n't need to work .

i get it .

she 's a dab hand with a racquet , your friend .

i 'll try and make it .

jack , look , next weekend i 'm having a house party . here ... it 's near oxford . why do n't you come ? it 'll just be social . no business . bring a friend . i 've plenty of room .

my author . he 's a terrorist . he 's written a kill-and-tell book . take care .

i 'm working on that soccer story .

i thought it was you . it 's the hair !

all right . as what ?

give up being a croupier , jack . or i 'll shop you . all you have to do is keep your word . it 's that simple .

i do n't want a criminal for a boyfriend .

you were talking in your sleep .

you will ?

i 'll leave the casino soon . i promise .

crap . it 's not relative . it 's unfair . like your casino . it 's designed unfair . and your croupier 's a little shit because he goes along with it .

-- it 's because of the sex , is n't it ? you do n't like the sex in it .

i do n't like it at all . you had a wonderful character before , the gambler . he was so romantic .

why not ?

well , that 's our life now , is n't it ?

i do n't finish till eight . make it nine and you 're on .

i love you jack , you know that .

there 's no third thing . do n't be superstitious .

you were a croupier there ? you never told me that . i thought you just knew some gamblers .

it came my way . 450 a week .

how did you land that ?

i 've got something to tell you .

of course they will . you just have to be patient . i 'm betting on you .

come on , marion . let 's face the truth . nobody 's going to publish it .

take it back . till you sell your book .

i owe you for the rent . it 's only a car . i can get another .

it 's not just inner beauty , is it ?

do n't let yourself down .

all right , dad . yes , i 'll call him .

it 's not that .

no .

jani ! where are you ?

i 've still got mine .

do you ?

thank you .

i have to take the car .

i told you , all bets are off .

let it go .

wait a minute ...

you keep the ten thousand pounds .

you 're serious .

then you 're not a pro .

that trick tonight , i do n't think i 've ever seen that before .

toss you for it .

absolutely not .

now there 's a coincidence . my father used to gamble there .

i was at a loose end . a friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership .

so why did you come to my casino ?

there 's a casino in this hotel .

impossible to calculate .

it 's against the rules . dealers are forbidden to talk to punters .

detective inspector ross .

turn left at the lights .

have i ?

mostly people in the casino business . a few drug dealers .

you 're talking about complicity .

so it 's mr clean . wise up , jack , this whole business is bent . the casino is nothing but legal theft . and that 's ok. it 's the system . half the punters who come in are using stolen money , drug money , they have n't earned it . we earn our money . i 'm on your side , jack . i do n't need an enemy .

what the fuck are you talking about ?

you 've done pretty well .

how long have you worked at the casino ?

nice car .

a pleasure . pity about bella .

does he win ?

mr tchai always likes to play at that table , and only with bella .

i just want the job .

fine .

we have tapes in here that go back six months . let me show you something .

no .

yes .

how ?

does know ? or does report ? what would happen if i knew something like that and did n't report it ?

have n't you forgotten something ?

they 've been tested .

give me 365 .

stacks of 20. rows of 5 .

there are three types of casino in the u.k. high volume . small faction . and motr . that 's middle of the road . us .

i was at beadles .

what the hell ?

what was that , i did n't hear ...

doolittle , are you there ?

it did n't go off .

where is the key ?

the key !

i think he 's talking to it .

remember when the artificial gravity , went out in the toilet ?

i 'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels .

talby , talby , can you read me ?

so do n't give me any of that sentient life crap . find me something i can blow up .

fuck that shit .

pinback , i have a computer reading of nine five seven seven .

all right , i have detonation time at ... wait a minute , something 's wrong with the clock . all right , i have detonation time at ... no , that ca n't be right , it says three years . okay , i have six minutes exactly . does that check out down there ?

huh ?

you are false data .

you wo n't consider another course of action , for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you ?

you have no proof that it was correct data .

so if you detonate in ...

that 's all beside the point . the concepts are valid , wherever they originate .

so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate .

yes , well ...

well then , you 've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe .

and you would n't want to explode on the basis of false data , would you ?

and you can only do it once , right ?

my sensory apparatus reveals it to me .

hmm ... well , i think , therefore i am .

intuition is no proof . what concrete evidence do you have of your own existence ?

well of course i exist .

are you willing to entertain a few concepts ?

this is lieutenant doolittle calling bomb # 20. i repeat previous order , you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay . do you understand ?

talby was in the air lock . you blew him out of the ship . i 'm going after him . turn on his helmet radio so i can contact him .

hello , pinback , are you there ?

5-4-3-2-1-drop , drop , drop !

-- remove thrust drive repellant --

who cares ?

commander powell would have named it .

yeah . eight , it says here .

new star . hey , guess what ? i got a new star on the readout .

pinback ...

phoenix ?

oh yeah ?

when you fall , doolittle , if there 's anyone down there on the planet , somebody may see you . they may see you coming down . what a beautiful way to die ... as a falling star ...

what happened , doolittle ?

not now !

sounds good , talby . let me know if anything important comes up .

sorry to interrupt your lunch , sir , but i 'm in the computer room , and i think i 've located the malfunction . the scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser , down by the emergency air lock . ca n't pinpoint it exactly , but i 'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it .

ah , doolittle , i do have a malfunction on this readout , but i ca n't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is .

the waves at malibu and zuma were fantastic in the springs talby . i can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit ...

i ca n't talk to the others , but with time to myself , i think about back home , back home at malibu . i used to surf a lot , talby . i used to be a great surfer .

i do n't like to go below since commander powell died . i feel enclosed down there . if it were big enough , i 'd sleep up here ...

men ... men ... what happened , men ?

no , no , doolittle , you talk to it . teach it phenomenology , doolittle .

talk to the bomb .

ah ... it seems to me , doolittle ... sorry , i 've drawn a blank . hold it . i 'll have it again in a minute . i forget so many things in here , so many things . hold on , just a minute , let me think ...

sorry , sir , you faded out there for a minute .

ah ... pity , pity ...

commander , sir , we have a big problem . you see , the veil nebula bomb , bomb number 20 , is stuck . it wo n't drop from the bomb bay . it refuses to listen and plans to detonate in -- -- less than eleven minutes .

how i make my living , what 's your point ?

yeah .

oh , yeah ?

who are you ?

this wo n't hurt . triple dose of insulin , you 'll go into a coma , couple minutes you 'll stop breathing and on a busy night , the coroner will probably mistake it for an o.d . plus , it 's way classier than blowin ' your brains out .

none of your business .

this is what your life 's worth , bruno .

how come i never hearda you before ?

security camera got you coming outta the stairwell , weapon in your hand , going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient . it 's embarrassing to the professional community , is what it is .

that 's a lotta crap .

you 're in the last two seconds , you do n't cut the crap .

actually , that 's not gon na be necessary .

or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is .

now that that 's out of the way ... you want the woman , here 's how it works . you pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever , and i make a call to bring her in .

move it .

you know each other ?

'cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend ? who would take offense to that ?

but i 'm afraid of --

out there .

lem me put some clothes on .

i 'm really glad we 're having this conversation . you 're right . i was angry at you . but talking about it -- the scales have fallen from my eyes and i see now that it was all my fault . can you ever forgive me ?

why would i be pissed ?

so max , what do you do with all your money ?

am i ?

which means i got ta fence it for two . who 's got that kinda scrilla lying around , these being the worst of the times .

thought i 'd let you have first crack ... later .

same old story . not interested .

you did n't ...

and for all his cattin ' around , not much of a stick man either .

yeah , me too .

look , we got ta keep the momentum up here , not give her a chance to think . if she hears her kid 's voice ...

we 're not going that route . sonrisa 's not someone you make deals with .

can you help me get her back ?

damn ... are you alright ?

when ?

sophy ? are you okay ?

then how come last night i heard you talking to logan and you were crying ?

are we in some kind of trouble ?

i know , honey , but just think how exiting it will be -- new house , new school , new friends --

goodnight bears . goodnight chairs . goodnight kittens . goodnight mittens . goodnight clocks . and goodnight socks . goodnight little house . and goodnight --

that was taken nine years ago ... i.d . 'd as michael hanover . sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at rawlins , wyoming for armed robbery . he escaped from custody after 4 days . has n't been seen or heard from since .

and you still think you can do something to change that .

and i feel real bad about all that but it does n't mean i need to get involved .

on accounta you , sonrisa did n't get to buy off the jury , or kill the judge . he 's gone . once and for all . it was war , max , and you won .

i 've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen , i just know they do . so the job 's to figure out how to deal with the consequences . which you did ... you took that sonuvabitch out .

they want me ... bad . or at least they do n't want me grabbed up by the chinese or whoever . best case , i wind up back in that facility . more likely , it 's a long drive out in the country , if you know what i mean .

i did n't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention .

so , you know the lengths he 'll go to keep her from going public ... i 'm turning lauren over to canadian law enforcement tomorrow . they 'll put her in witness protection , but if you 're with her the risk of her safety goes way down .

that 's low , but this effects me how exactly ?

the woman you met , lauren . she supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar . the real drug was shipped out of the country . the placebos were distributed to county va hospital and six veterans ' clinics in the area .

i need to find this technician , or anyone else who knows about project manticore . they would 've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work ... if i can track down one of them .

a girl .

i remember fine . i just did n't understand what was going on . they never told us anything except what to do . it took me a long time afterwards to figure things out .

we got separated right away . i never knew how many made it .

c'mon , max . first i watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you 're rocky the flying squirrel . then , i found this in your apartment .

you lost me .

the other one like you ...

only when i meet someone i have to know everything about .

gold leaf , art nouveau , french , early nineteen hundreds ... i could probably fence this for three or four grand .

look , if i made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out --

whoa there , tex ! we 've been through all this .

how 'm i s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo 's probably touched everything i own ?

you make it sound i pawed through your priceless collection of underwear .

completely different situation . i steal things in order to sell them . for money . it 's called commerce . but some stranger sneaking into a girl 's bedroom is ... bent .

you got a lotta nerve .

i 'm not a half bad cook .

yeah ...

personally , i 'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the trans american building with my pals . instead of giving myself a headache over stuff i ca n't do anything about .

what 's your shot in all this ? being a famous , anonymous , underground , pirate , cyber-journalist ca n't be much of a payday .

lauren 's not my wife .

lem me get my coat .

original cindy , say hi to my good friend --

who is ...

ca n't help you .

i understand .

help ... lem me go ... no , do n't let me go ... help ...

let go of my hand .

i think you should go now .

i thought it was important for you to know the facts .

how do i know you 're telling the truth ?

my name 's lydia . and it seems you and i have a lot in common .

just give it to me . i 'll remember .

got a pencil ?

you 're crazy .

here 's your money .

as long as you 're okay .

more money ... like i 'm shocked to hear you say that .

nothing so far from arrests , hospital admissions or coroners . this kind of search ... it 's heavy spadework . i 'm gon na need --

you were gon na run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks .

he got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food ... no bill of sale or nothing . it was right after the pulse so all the dmv records were wiped . so we do n't get anything on the seller . except i actually managed to find this guy , six hours on the phone ... say thank you .

right here someplace .

my name 's not kid . it 's client . as in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle . now , you got something for me or not ?

yeah , does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin ' on here .

you did .

but , of course , there 's nothing self- serving in that scenario .

please ...

and because i actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes .

and because he 's my friend .

yeah , 'cause maybe he 's learned his lesson .

more like a mystery ... which is n't bad . it 's just kinduv ... mysterious ...

long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book , right ?

yeah .

he was just trying to blame you 'cause he 's a slut .

no .

you 're not seriously buying into darren 's nonsense .

now , why ca n't i find a girlfriend like that ? brings him lunch everyday , thoughtful , sweet , legs from here to there --

no , but i broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day , know what i 'm saying ?

at least he did n't swing with your ride .

make the call .

i have sincere eyes .

so , how do you get the woman to come to me ?

not right now ? okay , when ?

do n't believe everything you hear on tv .

you 're the best , maxie .

say the words , `` i understand . ''

okay , okay , okay --

you were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish . and if i ever find out you 're going out the back door on natalie again , you 're the one who 's gon na be hanging by your ankles three stories up . understand ?

none of this would 've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint , which you did n't .

you rock , max . you ... rock ...

convinced her she needed to visit her mom in san mateo .

how 'd you get her out of town ?

i just do n't want natalie to ever find out . she deserves better .

you set up on lydia . when she 's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up . i answer the door and pretend to be natalie .

fight fire with fire . threaten to go to her husband .

hear me out . this person i 've been seeing is a jam pony client who happens to be married --

lame , self-serving , arrogant ... guilty as charged .

or do you think we 're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we 'll look the other way , which is arrogant and condescending .

do guys actually believe their lame , self- serving excuses ?

i know what you 're thinking . but the truth is , this other person is not someone i 'm in love with . as a matter of fact , after what she just did , she 's not even someone i like much . so in a technical sense , i 'm not sure you could call me and her cheating ... officially .

i got ta meet natalie for dinner .

later .

i do n't sleep ... theo asked me to pick up his check .

this is a hot run . beat it . you 're late .

you love him ?

well , amanda , this has been quite a night . so far you 've seen me and my dick throw up . what 's next ? projectile diarrhea ? man . what a stud , huh ?

huh ?

do n't be so glum , hawk . the night 's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities .

sure , i have . but not one with ice in it , that 's all .

you kidding ? this is detroit . drink ?

nah . once i get my own wheels , i could come up all the time .

my dad 's company is relocating him . we 're moving . that 's why i was acting so freaky in school today . i thought it was the last time i 'd ever see you . anyway , open the box . i would have given it to you this morning , except ... like i said , i was freaking out .

i have all your notebook doodles memorized , jam ... here .

so . is it true that gene simmons had a cow 's tongue grafted onto his real one ? y'know , to make it so long ?

beth , i ca n't believe you just said that because that 's exactly how i 've always felt about you ... call me jam . it 's my band name .

i 've loved you ever since i first laid eyes on you , jeremiah . i 've just always been too scared to show it .

believe it .

beth ? i ca n't believe it .

yeah ?

jeremiah ?

you got in the car , did n't you ?

what ? that 's disgusting !

so , are you , like , gon na polish our nobs , or what ?

for the next hour and a half it 's every dude for himself . try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 p.m. we 'll meet over there .

really , jam , you tryin ' to make us barf ?

oh , i 'll remember it till the day i die . his name was ... simpleton the simian ? no , samson samoan ... no , simply , similar ...

what was that d.j . 's name again ?

totally . all i 've had for chow was a packet of pop rocks and a yoo-hoo .

i 'm starvin ' and it 's way past lunchtime .

namely ?

maybe some tunage 'll chase those blues away .

no ... you do n't think ... ?

still too risky for my money . we 're running out of time here . this is kiss ! a victory for one is a victory for the team . i 'm sure i can barter with a scalper , but if you dudes think you got better plans , go for it . we 'll reconvene at that intersection ...

okay , shut the fuck up , lex ! now , then , step number one , we find us a scalper . i got ... twenty-five .

now listen up . here 's the game plan .

wake up , lex . this is detroit . the cops are n't gon na waste city dollars looking for a swedish car . face it , the volvo 's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced , diced , and julienned by christine , the chop shop gourmet .

now there 's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood .

jeezis , hawk , can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit ?

gim me a second , dudes . lem me think .

ok , dudes , follow my lead .

very funny , hawk . okay , i 'm in on this hare-brained scheme , but if anything happens to my mom 's car , i 'm blaming you . i 'll say you drugged me or something .

then lighten up . she 'll never know we touched it . alright , here 's the plan . we bus it to chez lex , grab the volvo , bail jam the hell outta st. bernard 's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to detroit .

too bad we 're stuck in electronics or ...

i have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life .

okay , enough . enough . gim me the tickets . i wan na hold onto them .

yo , doofus !

stellas . i hate stellas almost as much as i hate dogs .

okay . ahem ! you . are . a. dick . with . ears . and . a. really . bad . haircut .

no , i 'm dumber than a goddamn slug . now can i please clean your windshield and leave without further ado ?

and if it ai n't cleaned off ?

could be .

chief , here 's a little secret . drink heavily , your feet will know what to do . now shit or get off the pot . do you wan na dance or do you wan na see kiss only on their album covers ?

yeah , you 're probably too young anyhow .

guess you do n't want to see the greatest show on earth . and in detroit no less . well , take care , chief .

the easy way .

what ? ! are you mentally deranged , jam ?

do n't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off ?

if he offers you a slice , you 're not the least bit hungry , check ?

all right . after school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to detroit rock city .

cool .

gone ! ? why would i have the kiss tick ... ?

it 's my bullworker .

just keep your lying , heathenous trap shut , jeremiah .

i said , i 'm sorry !

what ? !

if i 'm anything like you , i 'll deserve him .

you mean , you 're sending me to ... b- b-boarding school ?

i made an appointment with father phillip mcnulty at st. bernard 's . we 're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot .

besides , those jeans are so tight i can see your penis .

you 're going to be late if you do n't hurry up and change soon .

ahh , sunshine .

uhh ... nothing .

splendid ! i love a good game of name that nightie .

okay ... when she peeled off that gown , you 'll never guess what she was wearing underneath .

well ? continue ! continue !

well , she was a very tempting siren , father . built like you would n't believe . so i gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour .

no .

that 's it ?

okay , i 'm just a little mad now ! jam , why 'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place ! ?

damn , she musta hot wired it . we picked up a professional car thief in the shape of olivia newton-john !

but we took the keys ?

let 's lift up her shirt .

simplicity , hawk .

waitaminit , dudes ! i got it ! maybe we can glue the tickets back together !

shrooms ! and even if it was lsd , i can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day .

jam has yet to do an overnight with us .

please , sir , do n't kick my ass ! i 'll do anything to get out of a beating !

it 's not nearly enough , punk .

what do you want ?

the kiss army !

i should hang up on you right now , but you 're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk . what are the names of the four members of kiss ?

hello ? is this me ? i 'm trip . am i on the air ?

now that 's what i like to hear ! because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears . they give in to their feelings of self-doubt ... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs , alcohol and premarital sex . empty solutions . these are toxic chemicals ... and disease-spreading behaviour .

hi ... what 's going on here ?

donnie , i 'm afraid i ca n't continue this conversation . i could lose my job .

not if you chose to stay within god 's channel ...

beg pardon ?

well ... the thing is , nobody remembers their infancy . and anyone who says they do is lying . we think that this would help develop memory earlier in life .

like a delorean .

i know that this is gon na sound kinda weird ... but do you know anything about time travel ?

when you fall asleep tonight , i 'm gon na fart in your face .

dea ex machina ...

you know what ? i think that you did it .

well , if you 're innocent , then you have nothing to worry about .

i did n't say shit .

you should already know that . watch the movie , donnie . i have something to show you .

how much longer is this gon na last ?

what happened to your eye ?

take it off . i want to see you .

i want to show you something .

where did you come from ?

i can do anything i want ... and so can you ...

who 's frank ?

there 's something you have to know , gretchen . everything is going to be just fine .

did you call the cops ?

will you please talk to me ?

the whole movie . let 's go .

yeah . so the idea is that ... you buy these glasses for your infant , and they wear them at night when they sleep .

oh , yeah . `` the philosophy of time travel '' . what is this ?

they suspended me for two days .

no ... donnie , wait . i 've never ...

that 's alright ... i understand .

well ...

like ... a hawaiian sunset ... the grand canyon . things that remind you how beautiful the world can be .

so when you sleepwalk , you go somewhere familiar ?

it 's like this big force ... that 's in your brain . but sometimes it grows bigger ... and it spread down into your arms and legs ... and it just sends you someplace .

where are you going ?

sure .

we never would have had this conversation .

until it withers away .

that 's easy . antiseptics .

i 'm sorry . i was in jail once . i accidentally burned down this house . it was abandoned . i got held back in school again . ca n't drive until i 'm eighteen . i think when i grow up i want to be a painter . or maybe a writer or maybe both . then i 'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book . you know , change things .

he stabbed my mom four times in the chest .

school 's cancelled .

well , yeah ... ok , but you 're not listening to me . there are other things that need to be taken into account here . like the whole spectrum of human emotion . you 're just lumping everything into these two categories ... and , like , denying everything else .

fear and love are the deepest of human emotions .

just place an x in the appropriate place on the lifeline .

i have to take the girls to los angeles tomorrow .

he ca n't , samantha . he 's been suspended from after-school activities . donnie ... are you still with us ? how was your therapy session tonight ?

i know i 'm not the best ... communicator . but whatever happens in your life ... whatever obstacles you come up against ... you just say ... and do whatever is in your heart . you be honest ... and tell the truth ... even if they look at you funny ... and they will . they 'll tell you that you 're wrong . they 'll call you a fool . but what you 've got to understand , son , is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit ... and they 're scared of people like you . because you 're smarter than all of them .

you 're right . roberta sparrow was famous for her gem collections . kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time . over the years ... as she got older , she became more and more of a recluse ... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself .

you know , roberta sparrow . we almost hit her with the car the other day .

grandma death .

no ... apparently they ca n't tell us what happened yet . something about a matching serial number that got burned . but i had to sign a form saying i would n't talk to anyone about it .

then go find her , donnie . do n't let her get away . she was right about the rabbits . go .

what 's `` cellar door '' ?

i do n't know . that 's a good question ... but suffice to say that i am no longer your english teacher . they fired me .

ms. pomeroy ... what 's going on ?

is the death of one species less tragic than another ?

donald , an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a god . you are an agnostic . an agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of god ... but does not deny the possibility that god exists .

it 's too late . i 've already ruined my life .

soon . time is almost up .

then how is time travel possible ?

where are we going ?

i think now that he might ...

i have to obey him ... because he saved my life . he controls me and i have to obey him or i 'll be left all alone ... and i 'll never figure out what all of this means ...

what else makes you feel regret ?

what did you want for christmas that year ?

do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead ?

people get hurt . i do n't want to hurt anyone .

but it was an accident . the house was under construction .

is it frank who wants you to destroy the world , to set the world on fire ?

have you ever made love , donald ?

are you embarrassed by these things that you see ?

no . that makes you keep searching .

it reminded me of my dog callie .

how does that make you feel ?

how are things going at school ?

so , tell me about your day , donald .

yes .

into the future . then he said that the world was coming to an end .

a jet engine fell on my house ... landed on my bed . while i was talking to frank on the golf course .

how so ?

all of this ... certainly is n't your mother 's fault , donald .

i 've been taking it . i just like to make her feel guilty for all of this . you know , abuse her . psychologically .

your mother said that you 've been skipping cycles of your medication .

everything is going to be just fine .

it 's not that . i mean mouthing off to your teachers . i 'll admit ... when dad told me what you said to ms. farmer , i laughed my ass off .

well , do n't worry ... i 'm taking my medication .

what 's her name ?

well , you know about his past . and when you said to look for signs of aggression ... he was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher .

frankie feedler . you remember him from high school ?

what ?

our son just called me a bitch .

how did you know --

i have n't been accepted yet , mother .

what else ?

i got twelve classrooms full of water . all coming from a busted water main .

oh , kitty , i do n't know . this is so last-minute ... eddie is in new york ...

beg pardon ?

rose , we have a crisis . i am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against jim cunningham .

and how do they do this ? they flood the house ... by breaking through the water main !

the bottom line ... mr. cole ... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour .

kitty ...

what is this shit ?

there 's no rule !

maybe martha moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus .

i got ta work with these women .

what ? for chrissakes , spit it out .

i never liked her , but she did n't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that . the whole thing 's just kinda sad and lame at the same time .

... yah -- well , at least , y'know , i got to perform . and mom got to see me . i guess number eight only worked for diane sawyer ...

you-betcha .

i heard you , i was just tryin ' to scare you into changin ' your mind . oh for chrissakes , amber , the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin ' through the air like a goddamn lawn dart !

i -- i 'm quittin ' the pageant .

do n't let that worry you , annette !

where is she ? !

yah ?

oh c'mon , i love 'em , but you know they only had me 'cause peter needed a kidney .

shut up , yous guys . look , amber , i 'm not gon na win . and let 's be honest , a family only needs one `` liza '' and you know peter 's got much better legs than me .

amber ? here .

it 's okay .

it 's me ... i just do n't want this to be the thing you 'd do over . this pageant 's your ticket outta here . i know you can win , amber .

god i hope that 's you and not your concussion talkin ' .

mom !

that 's my mom . i 'll get 'em in a sec .

good , 'cause this is n't an american teen princess pageant -- it 's , it 's nazi germany !

bitch !

if you 're gettin ' at somethin ' , you better just say it .

oh , amber , like you 're the only one who visits mary .

here , have some .

bye .

well , uh , i 'm cuttin ' out early today to do a little duck huntin ' ... but , uh , maybe i could call you tonight .

i know .

i got a hairdo .

i 'll be right back . see ya later .

y'know , if you have , you got all the pictures of the winner you need .

say , yous boys been to the leeman 's ?

oh , naw . hi .

you could be quiet .

my dress 'll reek .

the bitch .

ohio ...

we 're also the co-founders of the minnesota modeling academy . applications are at the tiki bar . we 'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address .

can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant ?

oh yah-sure , i know what some of your big city , no bra wearin ' , hairy- legged women 's libbers say , `` pageants are old-fashioned '' and , uh , and `` demeaning '' to the girls --

i wonder how she 's gon na fix that one .

gladys ! stop it !

lester ?

we 're not in the showroom , dear .

... you betcha . s'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight ...

i swear to god she ca n't do anything by herself .

we need more bars !

you know that sometimes it 's hard to understand god 's great plan .

it 's always hard to see the young ones called home , especially on an exploding thresher . it 's just so odd and gross .

well , you know , i think everyone 's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young .

`` proud ... to be ... an ... american . ''

i want to have the big bag of little donuts .

come on ! hankey here ca n't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat !

i will if you shut your piehole .

well , mom 's dead , so shut your fly trap .

ow , harold -- mom said not the head .

mom , i just finished the third movement of that concerto i was working on . i put , like , this techno beat on this japanese folk tune -- wan na hear it ?

i 'm sorry , dad , but with all due respect , my name is n't `` tina , '' it 's seiko .

king solomon was game he gave each girl his name to number them would make a list that long i 'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong .

of course you 're all aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where i 'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong

he should be king !

yes , sir .

they 'll know i mean business then they get that letter ... see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too .

eureka ammunition company , gentlemen . your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight . gloria , i could go for you in a big way . however , the rifles you sent were a little rusty and i do n't say that to everybody . have not received last month 's drawing account ; how come your neck is like a swan . yours very truly ...

eureka ammunition company -- gentlemen -- your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight -- gloria , i could go for you in a big way -- however , the rifles you sent were a little rusty -- -- and i do n't say that to everybody -- have not received last month 's drawing account . how come ? your neck is like a swan ... yours very truly . now read it back .

we 'll start a fire -- -- and get rid of these microbes .

here i am , father ...

my dear president ... read it back ...

the president of the united states .

yes -- why ?

never mind his excellency -- you got ta your pocketbook ?

fine . we got ta him .

anything else ?

with a gun like that you can kill some of your own men .

we got ta two battalions and one frenchman .

i ca n't do it ...

you no got ta no gun .

you 're right about that guy -- i think we 've got something .

you 're lucky i do n't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself . where did you hear that story ?

she did .

why did n't his niece slap your face ?

my card .

let 's see -- what 've i got in my cabinet besides mice -- i 've got it -- how would you like to be secretary of the interior ?

oh , no -- nothing doing . i had a brother who was a vice-president once and that 's the last we ever heard of him .

no , but i shot some ducks .

did you shoot the rapids ?

you would n't consider going over niagara falls without a barrel ?

i can use you in the house of representatives . we need a man who understands dogs -- and that 's where this country is going to . step inside .

i do n't want him .

what kind of a dog is he ?

have you got a license ?

hey you ! !

all right -- i 'll go out and find one .

the husband steps outside ; relinquishes his bride ; we stand him up against the wall and take him for a ride .

if any man should come between a husband and his bride , we find out which one she prefers by letting her decide . if she prefers the other man , the husband steps outside ; we stand him up against the wall and pop goes the weasel !

are you sure you 're not tired ?

i shall dance for you tonight as i 've never danced before .

oh yes ! -- upstart !

was it -- swine ?

i am willing to apologize ... i 'm willing to do anything to prevent this war .

how 're ya fixed for ammunition ?

then it 's war ?

you worm !

give me that again !

this has gone far enough ! this interruption is humiliating , to say the least ...

ca n't we go some place where we can be alone ?

excellency , may i present my niece .

your excellency , have n't we met before ?

this is treason ! ! what a fool i was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --

do n't bother me - i 'm thinking -- what was that ?

take a seat -- you 're next .

your excellency , you must n't forget your appointment at the house of representatives ... have you got your speech ready ?

you 've made a wonderful impression . your views are liberal ... it is easy to see you have an open mind .

these are the laws of my administration : no one 's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- and whistling is forbidden ...

if it 's not asking too much -- for our information just for illustration tell us how you intend to run the nation .

you 're not so bad yourself , mrs. teasdale , when i look at you i can see that we 're facing a crisis . we 've got to balance the budget -- we 've got to cut down everything including , you .

the future of freedonia rests upon you . promise me you will follow in my husband 's footsteps .

you can keep it -- i 've got a whole pack ... now what were you saying ?

ambassador ! i am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator .

what is money ? mrs. teasdale , for you -- i would do anything .

perhaps he will listen to you ...

i thought everything was working out fine .

maybe it 's not going to be so easy . from what i 've heard , mrs. teasdale is rather sweet on this rufus t. firefly .

how lovely .

oh frederick .

frederick , just what is it that you are saying ?

oh ... i 've just been thinking about something that man bytes said .

you stay with me .

i 'm sorry ... i do n't know either . i just do n't know .

i should n't be . we made great progress today . i taught him to repeat a few basic phrases . he did rather well , too , but i had to lead him every step of the way . though frankly , at times i was unsure of who was leading whom .

i 'll join you shortly .

you wo n't be long ?

our man is sick . come right away .

did you see it ?

aw , bytes , he 's sick .

you sly bastard . you 're doing this to spite me , are n't you !

now i think we really do understand one another .

so you can beat him ? so you can starve him ? a dog in the street would fare better with you !

all you do is profit from another man 's misery !

he 's still very sick . please come downstairs with me . i 'll explain the situation .

that 's the way he sleeps . if he lays down , he 'll die . head 's too heavy .

why is he sitting up like this ? he needs rest .

he 's a clumsy git . never watches where he is going .

he was fine when he left here , and now look at him .

what did you do to him ? he 's been like this all night !

steady on , treves . have a seat .

well ... i 'll let you know if there 's something in the afternoon post .

no , we do n't . their committees have informed me that they 're unwilling to take mr. merrick , even if they were supplied with funds . they do n't want him .

no you ca n't . you ca n't begin to know , no one can .

treves . well done .

i do n't understand .

how did you , know the rest ? i never taught you the rest of it .

i 'm sorry too . he simply does n't belong here . he 's be much happier somewhere else , where he could be constantly looked after . believe me , frederick , it 's better that it worked out this way . good day .

and what was that , john ?

yes , i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for incurables . i 'm afraid that they were n't very encouraging , but they said they 'd bring it up at their next committee meeting , so we should have their answers shortly .

... as i said , it 's only a physical problem ... but i do feel that mr. merrick is very flattered that you 're taking the time and trouble to meet him , and he 's most anxious to make a good impression , so he might seem rather nervous .

then will you meet him , as a representative of the committee .

i really do n't think that 's necessary treves . i 'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case , such as they are .

a few words ? i thought he was imbecile ?

ah , no sir . i had planned to see them in the morning .

i certainly sympathize with your problem , treves ... why do n't you try the british home , or the royal hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him .

oh , is he a friend of yours ?

yes sir .

well sir , he 's quite seriously deformed , and i fear the other patients would find him ... rather shocking .

why is n't he in the general ward , then ?

indeed !

i hope we can talk together again sometime . good day .

what is it , treves ?

he 's imbecile , no doubt from birth . he speaks , but ... it 's all gibberish . no , the man 's a homeless idiot ... i pray god he 's an idiot .

you 'll know presently . at the meeting of the society . but until then , i beg of you fox , keep it to yourself .

how long has this man been here ?

o bon dieu ! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies .

ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .

well you must go . it is one of the most beautiful places on earth . of course , i 'm rather partial .

oh no , mr. merrick . i just work there .

yes .

how awful for john .

oh , yes .

wo n't be a moment .

yes .

y-y-yes --

yes ... well , good day , mr. merrick .

... i learned a long time ago .

it 's alright , it was thrown away . no one wants it . it 's just that it 's a little dirty , that 's all .

i meant no harm , it was the only place where i could find cardboard . i thought it has been thrown away .

good morning , mr. merrick .

well , if there is nothing more , i suppose we 'll be leaving you now .

goodnight john . sleep well .

no , john , not one that i can see .

i 'm glad , john . goodnight .

mr. treves . thank you my ... friends .

oh , mr. treves . mr. treves .

you want a dressing bag , john ?

oh no ! there is nothing ! i have everything , you have given me everything i could possibly want . i am happy every hour of the day . i only wish there was something i could give to you .

never , oh ! never , nothing will die . the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats nothing will die .

who are they of ?

you look splendid , john .

you did not ask me .

hello ... my name is john merrick . i am very pleased to meet you .

righteousness ...

well , that 's alright . i understand you . now , say the whole thing again , hello ...

mmmerrick .

hello ...

welcome home , john .

so you see , john , there 's no need for a lighthouse . all your friends are here .

you do n't think it 's too gaudy , do you .

oh ? ... well , quickly please , mothershead , i 'm overdue .

excuse me , sir . i 'd like to have a word with you .

incredible , is n't it ? well , i think john has had enough visitors for one day , mothershead . i 've got a lecture at the college , i 'll be back this evening .

we 've made tremendous strides today , mothershead . he listens and repeats with great attention , and this certainly is n't easy for him .

good morning , mr. treves . it 'll be his bath-time soon . has he eaten ?

yes ... well , i want you to clear up a little mess , a breakfast tray was spilt . and bring up another breakfast . when you 've done that , you and i shall give the man a bath . but , mothershead , i 'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this , above all , do not scream , do not cry out , or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him ...

you 're the monster ! you 're the freak ! get out ! you 're finished !

where is mr. merrick ?

i 'll send a cab . here is my card .

pardon me ?

handsomely ? ... who sent you ?

it 's sinking ! hy-brasil is sinking !

it 's all right ! it is n't happening !

ah ! it 's my father !

blow the third note ! the note to take us home !

not quite ...

the second note .

yes -- i believe you do .

that 's right !

just give me a hand .

i 've never loved anybody !

what was she like ?

it was different ...

what ... you mean `` got into bed with '' them ?

put them down ! please make them put them down .

please ! please ! what are those ?

what did you say ?

but ... how is it you can see me ? you can all see me ?

that i can not tell you .

he wants to kill us !

do n't talk nonsense .

i 'll tell you what ...

your majesty ! we come from a world where there is no music . where men live and die by the axe and by the sword ...

no .

now i want you to be absolutely , totally , genuinely honest with me . did you really , truly , honestly like it ?

i 'll ask the gods to give you life again !

oh , thanks .

ah .

i just said i did n't feel like raping you .

oh ! stop talking as if we were married !

oh well -- you 've got to do them .

i do n't suppose you ... you do like me at all ?

it 's obvious you have n't raped anyone in your life .

looting and pillaging , eh ?

me ? of course ! i 've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast .

i know . i know .

i know !

you mean if just one person gets killed ?

i know . snorri ! get your oar out !

who have you been talking to ?

what did he say ?

you may need a real berserk .

what are you doing here ?

but you 're the gods !

fenrir the wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time .

we do n't have to help anybody .

you must help us .

were n't we supposed to ?

first we 're flying -- now we 're sinking !

you ca n't have sven 's father sitting next to sven . they 'll argue the whole time .

oh ... right ! well ... cheers everybody !

what are you talking about ?

keitel blacksmith ?

wait , erik !

i have to go ...

we must blow the first note ... he note that will take us to asgaard ...

yes it does ! we could be at sea for months .

but how ?

nobody 's ever crossed the rainbow bridge to asgaard .

and you , sven , are n't you afraid of crossing the rainbow bridge to asgaard ?

please .

it ca n't do you any harm ...

same thing , is n't it ?

there was thorbjorn vifilsson 's wife . you converted her .

and a sort of slightly sick feeling ?

you do n't need to feel bad about being sea-sick , you know .

no , i 'm not .

aaagh !

what have you got there ?

oh ...

i ... i ...

i should have got rid of you long ago !

you 'll drown us bo ...

relax !

how can we stops him now ?

are you going to let erik wake the gods ?

well ... i ... i thought ...

they chase fenrir the wolf from the sky ...

ca n't make enough swords !

sh !

death to dragons !

it 's no good going berserk against a dragon !

i know ! i 've heard it all 1 thousand times !

but it 's a responsibility being a berserk .

i went berserk in every battle i ever fought for king harald ...

no ... he 's not ... not ... there ...

erik 's right ! we 'll all meet in valhalla .

you liar !

i never do ...

yes , mother .

no one .

i did . you said , things were fine .

just a little overworked , maybe .

i 'm sorry naomi could n't make it . you okay ? you seem quiet .

maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on . just make a clean break .

she 's punishing me for being honest . i should just go to her house .

but i thought , i do n't know , i thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what i was feeling and that you were attracted to it .

in the room ?

i really want to , but tonight 's important . test tomorrow .

come over after i 'm done here ?

what ? no . i do n't like the term boyfriend . it 's so gay .

well , why do n't you tell me what 's going on ? do you mind if i turn this on ?

how are you today ?

did i use the term `` sexual conquests '' or is that your way of putting it .

well , sounds like me . sorry , man . says you were jealous and suspicious .

says you were a bully ...

says you were closed off , non communicative , never told me what you were feeling .

i 'm nervous because i have and enormous crush on you .

-- and i 'm just too nervous around you right now .

listen , did you want to make love ?

i love you .

what if you stay this time ?

no , it 's our house ! just tonight -- -- we 're david and ruth laskin . which one do you want to be ? i prefer to be ruth but i 'm flexible . alcohol ! you make drinks . i 'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more ruth . i 'm ruthless at the moment .

yeah . what 's your girlfriend 's name ?

what are you doing ?

at least i have n't been barking up the wrong tree .

female .

um , no .

and you picked it out of my plate before i could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers .

hi .

hi there .

remember me . try your best . maybe we can .

so make your domestic decisions and maybe we 'll talk again .

okay .

yeah ?

sorry to track you down like this . i 'm not a stalker . but i needed to see you .

i did n't think you 'd show your face around me again . i figured you were humiliated . you did run away , after all .

i did it . i guess that means something .

come up and see me ... now .

i dropped you off after . you said --

i was so nervous . i remember i could n't think of anything to say . there were long silences .

i 'm sure , i said .

yeah .

do you remember what we talked about ?

i scoured the city for it .

thanks , joely . a present ! oh boy !

i do n't like it either , but i 'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --

this kid , joe early , is going to beat the shit out of me .

gross ! you must remember to tell me this in the morning . i 'm , like , so freaked out now .

joel , joely , look ... it 's not fading . the memory . i think we 're hidden .

what do you mean ?

what if you hide me ?

wow . um , well ... ca n't you just force yourself awake ?

oh ?

no . thanks .

you do n't tell me things , joel . i 'm an open book . i tell you everything . every damn embarrassing thing . you do n't trust me .

you 're a whiz kid . so perceptive , so --

i 'd make a fucking good mother ! i love children ! i 'm creative and smart and i 'd make a fucking good mother !

let 's talk about it later .

let me drive you home .

you did n't say anything about my hair .

so , i enjoyed meeting you .

yeah ? oh , great !

oh , yeah .

no , not at all .

i 'm nervous . you do n't need to be nervous around me , though . i like you . do you think i 'm repulsively fat ?

you 're really nice . i 'm sorry i yelled at you before about it . god , i 'm an idiot .

oh . does that make you sad ? or anxious ? i 'm always anxious thinking i 'm not living my life to the fullest , y'know ? taking advantage of every possibility ? just making sure that i 'm not wasting one second of the little time i have .

i know a man who needs a refill .

i do n't know .

hey , do you want to have a drink ? i have lots of drinks . and i could --

well , i would n't want to be --

remember ? `` and you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/and i 'm lost in the window/i hide on the stairway/i hang in the curtain/i sleep in your hat ... '' oh , shit . i 'm so stupid . sorry .

sort of , um ...

i like to read .

look , i 'm very sorry i came off sort of nutso . i 'm not really .

where do you live ?

unless i get that hair-color-naming job .

that 's okay .

i 'm sorry i ... yelled at you . was it yelling ? i ca n't really tell . whatever , i 'm a little out of sorts today .

yes ?

okay .

now i 'm nice ? do n't you know any other adjectives ? there 's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative ... mumpish .

oh . i do n't know . i was just ... i do n't know . i was ... you seemed nice , so --

oh my darlin ' , oh my darlin ' , oh my darlin ' clementine ? no ?

well , you do n't know me , so ... you do n't know , do you ?

i think . anyway , i 've tried all their colors . more than once . i 'm getting too old for this . but it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality . i apply my personality in a paste . you ?

anyway , this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names . red menace , yellow fever , green revolution . that 'd be a job , coming up with those names . how do you get a job like that ? that 's what i 'll do . fuck the dole .

i ca n't remember .

i 'll go on the dole . like my daddy before me .

-- because i go there all the time . i do n't think i ever saw you before .

really ? because --

the weirder part is i think actually i recognize you . i thought that earlier in the diner . that 's why i was looking at you . you work at borders , right ?

jesus .

i do n't know . panties and --

i know . i spoke to my friend magda .

it 's true .

did you send this ? is it a joke ?

hmmm . do you miss me ?

i know . i had to take the day to think .

so you 're still on the zoloft ?

but i went back to my food . the next thing i remember , i felt someone sitting next to me and i saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye .

your back to me . in that orange sweatshirt i would come to know so well and even hate eventually . at the time i thought , how cool , an orange sweatshirt .

how 's the chicken ?

any messages , carmen ?

got ta get home . how could she do this to me ? how could she not care about what we meant to each other . what a fuck ! what a fucking monster she is !

maybe if i just explain what happened , i would n't have to go through this and i could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and ...

it was snowing .

yes , but ... i 'm just something you 're imagining . what can i do ? i 'm in your head , too .

so i 'm going to get some sleep . i 'm glad you 're okay .

i had a good time last night . i really did .

i do n't know . i 'm not sure there 's a big public demand for books on calvinism and misogyny .

so you think the dissertation will get published ?

i 'm sorry . i really should n't have --

well , it was my fault -- the break- up . i 'm sorry .

it 's been a pretty lonely couple of years .

i hope you get your work done .

do n't say `` we '' when you mean `` you . ''

y'know , we 've been , i do n't know , sort of , unhappy with each other and --

i do n't know , i 've just been thinking , maybe we 're not happy with each other .

so what 's going on , joel ?

yours ?

nah , i do n't know .

mary ... please . this is hurting people .

what 's this ?

can i ... i brought some --

hi .

oh .

do you remember anything else ? what i was wearing ? was i standing close to him ? was i leaning against his car like i owned it ? how did he look at me when i giggled ? tell me everything .

i never saw you together like that again . so i figured i was imagining things .

and you never even suspected ? never saw us behaving in any unusual way together ?

he 's coming ?

no way . i can handle this .

i do n't know . he 's not on the map .

listen , it 's not erasing .

you love him , do n't you ?

to let people begin again . it 's beautiful . you look at a baby and it 's so fresh , so clean , so free . and adults ... they 're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness ... hopelessness . and howard just makes it go away .

it 's a good one all right .

yeah . poor guy . have anything to drink ?

hey , if you 're ordering lunch for mierzwiak , would you --

i know . anyway --

it 's just ... y'know ... i mean ...

hi .

thanks . so ... do we talk about this ... or what ?

no you 're right . once again . you 're a decent man , howard .

i 've loved you for a very long time . i 'm sorry ! i should n't have said that .

really ? i thought it was appropriate maybe . that 's all . i really admire the work that you do . i know it 's not proper to be so familiar but i guess since we 're outside the workplace i feel a certain liberty to --

oh . well , i 'd love to hear some .

okay , we 're back in .

thanks .

order me a pastrami for after ?

jesus . all right , what 's the address .

i was away from the monitor for a second . i had it on automatic . i had to go pee .

okay , what happened right before he disappeared ?

stan ? what 's going on ?

thanks , stan . thanks .

howard , they 've disappeared again .

i tried that already .

maybe after the holidays then .

this book -- it 's essential that people read it because -- -- it 's the truth . and only i know it .

oh , hi .

what 's your bartlett 's ?

mary hates me . i 've never been popular with the ladies .

she was beautiful . so sweet and funky and voluptuous . i kind of stole a pair of her panties , is what .

the thing is ... my situation is a little weird . my girlfriend situation .

did i tell you i have a new girlfriend ?

she likes you okay .

yeah ?

not a dump , then , but kind of plain . uninspired . and there 's a stale smell . sort of stuffy . i do n't know . stuffy .

then check the connections .

the voltage looks fine .

suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics . all in siwash cave . in a postcatastrophe world , your offspring would of necessity intermarry , forming in time a tribe . a tribe every member of which had giant thumbs . a tribe of big thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways . it could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools . it would have to rely on its wits and its senses . it would have to live with animals -- and plants ! -- as virtual equals . it 's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants , learning their languages , perhaps , and paying them the respect they deserve .

you mean she 's dead ?

the countess has come to our aid . the rubber rose ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls . and i have been asked to oversee the ranch . for $ 300 a week . and as it turns out , the countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was ... here 's a picture !

siwash , huh ?

save your breath for the climb .

oh ? well , there 's been some trouble on the ranch . i came up here to get out of the way . it 's so dark now i doubt if i could find my way back down . if you could help ...

i know who you are .

i 'm staying with the countess .

if i flinch when you say you love me , it 's both our problems . my confusion becomes your confusion . students confuse teachers , patients confuse psychiatrists , lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts ... .

i would n't say that . i expect she 's right , ultimately . but i 'm with delores when it comes to fighting for what 's mine . i ca n't understand why delores is so uptight about the chink ; he could probably teach her a thing or two . ee ! that grass tickles , does n't it ? god knows i love women , but nothing can take the place of a man that fits . still this is cowgirl territory and i 'll stand with delores and fight any bastards who might deny it . i guess i 've always been a scrapper . look . this scar . only twelve years old and i was felled by a silver bullet .

about being a cowgirl . what 's it all about ? when you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl .

chink 's the guy 's name , for christ 's sake .

she always leaves town , you dummy . that does n't mean anything . what about in bed ? how does she like it in bed ?

oh , you ! i 'm not talking about her hands . they 're difficult to ignore , i confess , but i 'm speaking of her whole being . her whole being is extraordinary . the way she talks , for example . she 's so articulate .

extraordinary !

here . i 'll turn down the air conditioner .

when i was younger , i hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping , without food or sleep , crossed the continent twice in six days , cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways .

you 're the best ?

for magazines ?

i ca n't be certain that you would . but what have you got to lose ?

but countess ...

if you do n't want me to pose for him , why do you want me to meet him ?

the food and drug administration said wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters , burns and rashes . although the fda judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market , they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings .

what ? oh yes . tee-hee . jellybean .

shit o goodness , you wo n't be thirty for another year , and you 're more beautiful than ever .

i 've always been proud of the way nature singled me out . it 's the people who have been deformed by society i feel sorry for . i 've been steady moving for eleven years and some months . maybe i should rest up for a spell , i 'm not as young as i used to be .

tired ...

to my own special sissy . cheers ! and welcome . so my letter brought ya flying , eh ? where were you ? salt lake city ? la conner ? well , i may have a little surprise for you . but first , tell me about yourself . it 's been six months , has n't it ? in some circles that 's half a year . how are you ?

uh , yeah coop , i 'm still here .

so if the ship did n't blow up , what happened ?

on my way .

this is cooper , what the hell do you do on this ship , anyway ?

time to play spam in the can .

saw what , mr. cooper ? what did you really see , because what you 're describing is not physically possible ...

no , he did n't .

it was like ... nothing was there ... and then justin appeared and the core ... became metal ...

i 'm gon na activate the emergency beacon .

weir . he used one of the explosives from the corridor .

no . i do n't believe in that sort of thing . but if dr. weir is right , this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe , of reality . who knows where this ship has been ... what it 's seen ... and what it 's brought back with it .

`` another man ? '' who ?

he 'll live ... if we ever make it back .

his vitals are stable , but he 's unresponsive to stimuli . he might wake up in fifteen minutes . he might not wake up at all .

how is he ?

we have n't tested the air yet . it could be contaminated ...

his peritoneum has ruptured ...

intubate , pure oxygen feed , get the nitrogen out of his blood ...

pressure ?

what 's wrong ?

what 's happening ... ?

what 's wrong ?

he does n't belong on this mission . responsible or not , he blames himself . he 's too close to it . and then there 's his wife .

what does ?

i 'm going in .

justin . i wo n't let you die .

but i ca n't ... i got ta get out of here ... skipper , please ...

justin .

patch me through to him .

everything green on my boards , skipper .

dr. weir , you have no experience with salvage procedures .

this is weir .

thanks .

that 's a negative , starck .

do it .

peters ...

there 's no one here , skipper .

peters is right , no one 's here .

jesus its huge .

we 've got pressure .

no , no , its alright . i talked to my ex , he 'll keep denny over christmas and i 'll get him this summer . goddam it , skipper ... i have n't seen him in two months .

what 's the hold up ?

nooo !

you 're lying ... !

there is no devil . there is no god . there is only ... nothing .

i 'm not the devil .

do you know what a singularity is , miller ? does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is ? it is nothing . absolute and eternal nothing . and if god is everything , then i have seen the devil . it 's a liberating experience .

you ca n't leave . she wo n't let you .

i do n't know ...

where has it been for the past seven years ?

to what ? where did this ship go ? where did you send it ?

what do you want me to say ?

we 're a long way from home and we 're in a bad place . let 's not make it worse . if anyone has any constructive suggestions , now is the time .

we do n't get the power back , our air 's gon na go bad .

the core ... !

the date .

there 's no danger . the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields , it 's under control .

one of my men is down . i want to know what happened to him .

dr. weir 's right . get on board the event horizon . i 'll meet you at the airlock .

they 're empty , dr. weir . moving forward .

easy , peters , we 're okay , we 're okay . let 's finish the sweep .

that 's the engineering containment . and there 's the main airlock . we can dock there .

where has it been for the last seven years ?

it was the ship 's maiden voyage , to test the drive . the event horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters . they received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive . and the ship vanished from all our scopes . no radar contact , no enhanced optical , no radio contact of any kind . they disappeared without a trace . until now .

captain miller , i just want to say ...

get out of there now !

no , no , we just got her back together ...

i just saw weir , i think he was messing around on the clark .

they 're gone .

captain miller ...

yes , sir .

bring us in tight . starck , get on the horn , see if anyone 's listening ...

what is that ?

weir .

... repeat , we 're armed ...

i 'll do it --

we blow the corridor . use the foredecks as a lifeboat , separate it from the rest of the ship . we stay put ...

five seconds .

stay here ! do n't stop working !

... i ran the bio-scan with the dna/rna filter . the results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin ...

what is it , starck ?

dr. weir , you were right there , you must have heard something , seen something ...

we can take the filters from the clark ...

it 's building up with every breath we take . and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot .

oxygen is not the problem .

crossing the horizon . optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees .

there 's no one here .

you 're at the bridge , ms. peters . you still have n't seen any crew ?

they attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for titan . the shuttle 's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue , flooded both ships with pure oxygen . there was a spark and both ships were incinerated . the skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat . captain miller was able ...

he served on the goliath .

he 's been past mars ?

first time in a grav couch ?

it 's cold .

you got any coffee ?

we have to do something , oh god ...

yes . yes , justin , we heard it .

what the hell is that ?

dead ahead , 5000 meters .

get them back --

range 500 meters and holding . turbulence is dropping off ...

1000 meters ...

if they are , they 're screening their calls .

matching speed ... now . range to target ten thousand meters and closing ... skipper , i got a bad feeling about this ...

30 hours to neptune orbit .

smith 's right . neptune ? there 's nothing out there . if something happens , we 'll be on our own .

i ca n't believe this , i have n't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit . why not mars , cap , mars has women ...

it means nothing .

no , there 's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind . it 's as if time just ... stopped for seven years .

it must be hard , being so far away from her .

hmmm . claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her . i told her that was n't true , i just knew the event horizon better , that 's all .

that 's how the gravity drive works , you see : it focuses the black hole 's immense gravitational power to create the gateway . that 's how the event horizon travels faster than light .

affirmative . the hull 's intact ... but there 's no gravity and the thermal units are off line . i 'm showing deep cold . the crew could n't survive unless they were in stasis .

do they have pressure ?

we 're going to have to work on your touch .

my step-dad 's . i 'm strictly into stone . i was wondering when you 'd walk by .

relax , it 's casual .

trust me , this ai n't one of those times .

you would n't say that , if you could see me .

you know , you could ' a run an ad in the personals .

it 's not him . it 's them . i ca n't live like this .

you look like an eighties rock band .

victor did .

i can handle the ship . i can even handle mr. blonde ambition . but i do n't know if i should be flying or playing vegas in these suits . who the hell came up with them ?

and you can ? power it up ?

i 'm worried about you .

i already got it . everything i want .

baby , you 're scaring me .

do n't come any closer for a sec . this is gon na be kind of a shock ... you remember when we said `` together forever no matter what '' ?

ben ?

i 'll be watching over you .

ben , i 've been crunching the numbers on the machine . i think if we can rework the power settings ...

got it , teach .

ben , i do n't know if this thing 'll change us back or make us worse . i need you to be patient for a little while longe --

yeah . i can tell . victor was right .

we 're working as hard as we can --

it 's about to be a broken face .

okay . i 've uh , got some questions , from sue . that she thought might be better coming from me ... can you , you know , go to the bathroom ... like normal ...

what the -- !

are you alright ?

well maybe you should date him .

reed , i 'm not talking about debbie .

i should have done more , run more tests --

five times .

i 'm sure he 's matured since then .

they crashed it into a wall . a flight simulator .

ca n't do it . i can not do it .

ben , the money 's not important . we could save lives .

hey , i 'm mr. sensitivity now . clear the way , wide load coming through .

go back to the drawing board .

give me the god damn mirror !

'course not . strictly business .

what the hell you smiling at ? just keep your mouth shut , and your mind on those smbs --

that 's terrible news ...

what ?

and they 're changing into ...

not this again --

you 're hot !

he 's right . these costumes are ... missing something . i ca n't put my finger on it --

oh , well that 's easy : i 'm hot . you 're ... well , you 're a little limp . sue 's easy to see through . and ben 's always been a hardass . why are n't you writing this down ?

back it down , johnny !

this is wrong in so many ways .

oh , you dawg you . better not be my nurse !

the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna .

you 're gon na pay for that , pebbles . what ? !

uh , we call my sister the invisible girl ... the invisible girl .

front page ?

yes sir . you 've got the mayor at eight , then a nine-thirty interview with the journal --

sir , i 've always wondered ... why sue ? you could have any woman in the world but --

and that 's a good thing ?

stable . we 're looking at low twenties . it 's a good number , considering the fallout from --

recording , sir . we see you perfectly .

leonard , how 's the feed ?

it 's not just the money . i could make money in my sleep .

they 're ready for you , sir .

i 'm sure i can come up with something .

reed , stop , you need to rest your --

why did n't you say something ?

remember our first date here ... ? god , i was so nervous .

and you sure you can control this thing ? last time did n't work out so well .

but we 're the focus , right reed ? reed ... ?

curing countless diseases , not just ours .

i just wanted to share an apartment . what was so complicated about that ?

reed . i was ready for the next step , you were n't , ergo , i walked .

i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry , i did n't mean to do that ... you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --

anger . rage . frustration .

i 'm saying , if you had a little more self control , you could locate the trigger . can you remember the exact emotions when --

if it happened to him , then it could ...

what ... ? oh .

sue ... look at your hands .

you are such a dork , reed ... you never got it and never will unless it 's explained to you in quantum physics .

for science .

which was ?

you always had a way with words . i should be getting back .

victor , if we could understand what happened to us --

reed , we 're running out of time .

get a grip . reed . we did n't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch . just close the shields ...

sure .

not at all .

victor , we ca n't do anything until the research is ready .

i 'm sorry i did n't get a chance to --

victor , your scar --

raising the shields .

it 's been a good two years , victor ... the company 's accomplished so much .

well , when you 're looking at your future , it never hurts to find closure about the past .

i understand the business reasons .

i 'm just saying , i know what it 's like to lose something you love . to see it slip away , and know it 's never coming back .

'scuse me .

i 'm just glad we 're still together , lisa , because i need you this year .

apologize to that wimp ? no way . fuck dennis taylor .

if you 'd apologize i think dennis would take you back .

man , i do n't even want to see those guys from carl 's again .

later .

first door on your left !

i ca n't find it , mon !

come on , spicoli . why do n't you just put your shirts back on ? see the sign ?

something happened to them , mon .

this is how i dress all the time .

see that sign ? it says 100 % money back guarantee . do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee ' ? do they teach you that here ? give me my money back .

well , that 's not the way it works , really . and you ate most of your food already , too ...

all right , then . it 's your secret .

thanks a lot , brad . i really appreciate it .

see you later .

maybe yes . maybe no .

maybe yes . maybe no .

everybody loves lisa . everybody loves lisa . but everybody does n't have to be her boyfriend .

i do n't care it you tell me or not . i got problems of my own .

do n't worry about it . who sent the flowers ?

i 'll explain everything later .

do n't strain yourself .

your friends use the pool too .

hey-yo .

u.s. history . mr. hand .

you 're fired .

did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way ?

no , just a couple of surfers with no shirts on . i took care of it , dennis .

any problems ?

jeff you have company !

dad says !

dad says you 're late again , you butthole !

why do n't you call me up tonight ?

i think we 're making a lot of noise .

what ? are you all right ?

let 's continue .

no . are you crazy ?

he 's my friend , too .

listen . i feel pretty strange here . because mark really likes you , and he 's my friend .

oh , really ?

it 's a way , damone . it 's a vibe . i put it out , and i have personally found that girls do respond .

what do you read ? what 's the last book you read ?

so what makes you so sensitive ?

sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking .

whatever you say , rat .

damone . it 's mark .

you wuss . it 's no problem . one person says something to the other and that 's how it starts ...

hey , rat .

there used to be three or four of those guys . now we see 'em every time we come to the mall .

do n't talk to her . let her know . use your face . use your body . use everything . this is what i do . i just sent out the vibe and i have personally found that ... girls do respond . something happens .

well , what do you want me to do ? go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say , 'hello ! i 'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me ? '

it 's never too soon ! girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes .

what do you mean -- wuss ? this girl is my exact type . it 's her . definitely her .

you ... are a wuss . part wimp . part pussy .

and they do n't call my parents ?

all right , what you want to do is go to the free clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need nornel one plus fifty 's .

i 'm carrie frazier from toys ' r us . judy hinton from may company told me i could ask you something .

well , it pretty much speaks for itself . peter , you want to run with it ?

i 've been swimming , merv .

you ca n't fix this car , spicoli .

my brother 's car !

seen the new playboy ?

he is .

hey , slow down . this is my brother 's car .

there 's a world of guys out there . i just wish i did n't have to date any of them .

i ca n't believe it ! but what about doug ?

he says he 's got to stay in chicago . he says i should visit him sometimes .

he 's not coming .

i want romance .

stacy , he 's not a guy . he 's a little prick !

there goes your stereo for another year . mike damone is a no-brain little prick . i 'm not letting him get away with this .

that little prick .

i really thought he would show up . i waited ... and waited ... and waited ...

what ?

what do you think it is ?

god , i do n't think so . better look in the house .

god , he hardly even talks anymore .

what 's doug do in chicago ?

no . but it 's a nice idea .

okay , penis , that 's one , balls ...

oh , come on . what is he ? fifteen ?

thanks a lot .

stacy . how many times do i have to tell you ? you are really going to be beautiful ... someday .

if he ever calls again i 'll say i 'm eighteen .

come on , linda . it 's just sex .

so tell me , do you like ron ? is it serious ?

you 'll always remember your first time .

oh ! that 's where that group got its name from .

just kidding . about 10cc .

what do you mean 'better in bed . ' you either do it or you do n't .

oh , give me a break , stacy . you 're much prettier than them .

linda . that girl looks just like pat benatar .

i ca n't believe i start high school tomorrow .

i ca n't do that .

so what did you do ?

come on , stacy , it 's your section and your man .

if you graduate .

no way , mon . when i graduate u.s. history i ai n't even coming over to your side of the building .

well , then , i 'm glad i remembered to bring an extra copy just for you .

yeah . the graduation dance mr. hand . it 's the last school event of the year .

you better save some for me , you swine !

mr. spicoli , you 're on dangerous ground here . you 're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time .

learning about cuba . having some food .

i do n't know .

hey ! wait a minute ! there 's no birthday party for me here !

you just ripped my card in two !

what class ?

i think i better take you home .

i know , everyone says that .

i 'd like that .

hi , mark .

i 'll get you the notes .

john bonham ?

it 's john bonham 's birthday .

do you really have to go ?

... i 've got to go home .

sure .

naw . i do n't mind .

no , they 're away for the weekend . brad and i are watching the house .

i had a really nice time tonight .

two more cokes .

joey at cinema four said this is a pretty good restaurant .

oh ... yes .

are you sure there 's nothing else i can bring you ?

two cokes .

anything to drink ?

do n't worry . you 're protected . just treat this poor woman like you 'd treat any other human being in trouble .

the woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed . i think she was crying ...

what ? what was that crazy bitch said to him ? there 's a war on , man ! people are being killed !

ah , yes . mr. duke ? you have one message : `` call lucy at the americana hotel , room 1600 . ''

there 's no hurry ! the race is over !

well ... the manager , mr. heem , would like to meet him . nothing unusual . mr. heem likes to meet all our large accounts ... put them on a personal basis ... just a chat and a handshake , you understand .

you did the right thing . never try to understand a press message . about half the time we use codes -- especially with dr. gonzo .

what ?

cut their goddamn heads off . every one of them . that 's what we 're doing in california .

they 're everywhere . nobody 's safe . and sure as hell not in the south . they like warm weather ... you 'd never believe it . in l.a. it 's out of control . first it was drugs , now it 's witchcraft .

rum and ice , please .

you know what i mean . we 've done it before and we can damn well do it again !

you 're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum .

hell , i really hate to hear this . because everything that happens in california seems to get down our way , sooner or later . mostly atlanta . but that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful . all we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance . they did n't roam around much ... but now jesus , it seems nobody 's safe .

that 's how he got so big . when he quit the marines he was just a little guy .

naw ! not a major .

and nobody did anything ?

this is my granddaughter ...

never mind . let 's get right to the heart of this thing . twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the pogo lounge of the beverly wills hotel ...

i did n't think so . because in spite of his race , this man is extremely valuable to me . hell , i forgot all about this beer . you want one ? how about some ether ?

why not ? but for christ 's sake , just do it fast !

i was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing .

two glasses of ice water with ice .

so do we , lady .

sure . that 's a good idea . one whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia .

why not ? we should get some of that . just eat a big handful and see what happens .

jesus ... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time ? there 's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body !

where 'd you get this ?

hi , lucy ? yeah , it 's me . i got your message ... what ? hell , no , i taught the bastard a lesson he 'll never forget ... what ? no , not dead , but he wo n't be bothering anybody for a while . yeah . i left him out there , i stomped him , then pulled all his teeth out ...

relax . let me handle this . you 'd make a piss-poor lawyer ... room 1600 , please . as your attorney , i advise you not to worry . take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit .

lucy is looking for you .

hell , in malibu alone , these goddamn satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day . all they want is the blood . they 'll take people right off the street if they have to .

right . let 's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon . i feel a powerful lust for red salmon ...

as your attorney , i advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline .

it just occurred to me , that she has no witnesses . anything that she says about us is completely worthless .

the only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards . but , it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect : my attorney .

in a few hours , she 'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel samoan who fed her liquor and lsd , dragged her to a vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing , uncircumcised member .

well ... it 'll probably work out . we can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention .

you 're supposed to be in vegas . we have a suite at the flamingo . i was just about to leave for the airport .

are you ready ?

do it ! i want to get higher !

of course , i 'm your attorney , i 'll give you all the time you need , at my normal rates : $ 45 an hour -- but you 'll be wanting a cushion , so , why do n't you just lay one of those $ 100 bills down there beside the radio , and fuck off ?

you 're doomed . i 'm leaving here in two hours and then they 're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps . right there in that tub .

music ! turn it up . put that tape on .

have you made a deal with him ? did you put him on to her ?

room service sent it up . i wanted something to cut the limes .

do n't run . they 'd like any excuse to shoot us .

did you see that ? some sonofabitch kicked me in the back .

go ?

i have to go .

that 's what gives me the fear .

nonsense . we came here to find the american dream , and now we 're right in the vortex you want to quit . you must realize that we 've found the main nerve .

to do the job , of course . here we go ... a crab louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars !

that 's good ...

i just went upstairs to see this man lacerda . i told him i knew what he was up to ... he says he 's a photographer ! but when i mentioned savage henry he freaked ! he knows we 're onto him !

i was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo . and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things ! it wo n't be long before they tear us to shreds !

lacerda ?

you whore !

and eat them ! that bastard wo n't get away with this ! what 's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a doctor of journalism ?

what the fuck are we doing out here ? somebody call the police ! we need help !

where 's the medicine ?

my heart !

he said he understood , but i could see in his eyes that he did n't . he was lying to me .

god hell ! i think i see the pattern ! this one sounds like real trouble ! you 're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over . as your attorney i must advise you that you 'll need a very fast car with no top and after that , the cocaine . and then the tape recorder , for special music , and some acapulco shirts ... this blows my weekend , because naturally i 'll have to go with you -- and we 'll have to arm ourselves .

it 's okay . he 's admiring the shape of your skull .

you 'd pay me for that ?

you 're under arrest !

of course , officer .

spare me .

are you two all right ? did you see that ! ? they left ! we made it ! i think we made it !

i will not die because of him !

right .

with what just happened upstairs --

upstairs .

i think i know where a cb is .

c'mon guys --

i 'm gon na shoot him if they do n't get him first .

shit !

we just smeared a skunk .

it 's in the basement , about a hundred yards long . it spits out on the backside of that hill down the way . there 's a truck there .

there 's a tunnel .

they 're right here .

well , justice is funny .

no , no , no it was ... it was wild out there , no time to think , we just moved . he did n't leave me . he just ran . he just ran .

and that 's how i ended up here .

that 's an unwise thing to say , you know that ?

go douche .

your brother , huh ?

look , yeah , he 's an ass , but he 's my brother . que sera-sera .

all right ! tell us about the truck !

i 'm in .

you wan na see , baby ?

um-hmmm .

does n't your foot hurt ?

it 's much safer in there , sweety .

it 'll calm your nerves . works like a charm .

what is this ?

oh .

how are you holding up ?

let me make this clear ; if we stay , we die !

open ?

two .

four door ?

nothing .

what ?

go for it . it 's by the far wall . a small wave band . channel 9 is the emergency frequency . but i do n't see the point .

the boards are solid oak planks , and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath . nothing real or supernatural is busting through this , least nothing the size of the beasts .

he 's dead .

well , where 's the sonuvabitch ! ?

sit still , look less like a meal .

oh ? and what 's that ?

you young'uns worry about weapons , i 'm thinkin ' bout strategy .

no bullshit .

bullshit .

look , the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group . those that can shoot , protect the rest to his ride .

f-f-fuck you .

move your ass !

shit .

just a bat ! i 'm fine ! just a bat ! sorry !

what ?

'eh , chief ?

hold that tight !

helllppp !

oh jesus !

do n't worry , you 'll be like my little papoose .

i 'm in a wheelchair , the truck sounds pretty good .

help meee !

i 'm sure .

let 's move .

well , maybe they migrate ?

let 's wait it out .

you 'll hit us !

let 's go .

right . were going to need some fire power . do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here ? anything at all ?

do we have anything else to defend ourselves with ? anything ?

hold it !

we should stick together out there .

i know . thanks . just do n't tell anyone i have a soft side .

we all have to be strong , right ?

i 'm fine , i really am .

let 's lock off this room .

oh my god ... what is that ?

well ...

hey little bear , are n't you going to join the others ?

what 're you doing ?

frances ? oh no .

come on . they make you feel nice and peppy .

you 're right . i 'm sorry . okay , let 's go get 'em .

but we 've been at it since six this morning . at least you could 've let me go home and change .

come on , it 's just what you need ! let everyone see you . talk to them , live it up !

excuse me , sir ?

i 'm sure it was n't me , it was n't me ...

but i 'm the one up there on the screen .

no , i 'm concerned with everything .

that 's frances . i 'm not the cookbook .

i know . 'this is a factory and we each have our jobs . the writer writes , the director directs , and the actress ... '

uh-huh . you mean what if the public finds out i perspire ? and wear slacks . and drive an old jalopy ? what if they find out i 'm a real person . oh no ! say it ai n't so ! not a real person !

yes , but ... really , i hate to sound ... it 's just that the public expects something different from its stars . people wo n't take you seriously .

it 's a perfectly good car . it runs .

yeah , i mean slacks ... and work clothes ... and that awful car --

my clothes ?

well , i suppose i should just say it . it 's your clothes .

madam ... ?

good , good . give them that .

you 're afraid !

what does clifford say ?

but ... but wait a minute . we 're supposed to be different , right ? clifford says ... this theatre is supposed to be different ! and this play ... this play is all about what greed and money do to people !

well ... well , you see , that 's the point . you wo n't be opening in london .

that 's right . i do n't want them breathing down my neck while we 're in london .

oh .

hello , harold .

i 'm not afraid of struggle , clifford .

forgive my indulgence . seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy . the point is , mr. odets here has written a wonderful play . most of the roles are cast , but we have n't found our female lead ...

the group is more than a theatre company . it 's the embodiment of an ideal . our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense , a creative individual and an instrument of change . you see --

cool off , beautiful . did n't you see the sign says `` dimout zone ? '' there 's a war on , you know ?

you want his name ?

no . it 's all about that night , is n't it ?

no ?

i do n't suppose it occurred to you that i might want to leave too , that i might want to do theatre ? no , 'cause you do n't want me along , do you ? and the reason has nothing to do with summer stock .

hey , i 'm not a complete fool , you know . i can see you 're going sour on me , and when i try to do something about it , you turn your back and say it 's nothing .

dick , we need some time apart --

you were n't going to tell me , were you ? just pack up and leave , is that it ?

... yes .

yeah . she said she delivered your message and that you 'd understand .

fired ?

i got ta go now .

frances , we got ta do it this way . just remember tomorrow , remember what i told you . what 're you gon na tell 'em ?

i 'm taking care of that , harry . just hold her . reserpine . i guarantee you this 'll clear her head . she 'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing .

harry ? oh harry , i knew you 'd come . i love you , harry . i love ... take me home , harry .

you ... i 'm sorry , forgive me . doctor , tell me honestly , what do i have to do to get out of here ?

i 'm afraid not . you see , we observe things that you 're unaware of : signs , indicators . your problem cuts very deep , frances , and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out , you 'll really feel secure . does that make sense ?

were you an alcoholic ?

i pity us , dad . i pity us both .

are you ... are you hungry ?

please , francie ...

dad , here ! you do n't have to stop , just slow down . you can tell mama i jumped out . she knows that 's the kind of thing i 'd do . she wo n't blame you .

why ? it 's such a simple thing . you just let me out and i disappear down a road and you never have to see me again .

always . always .

what do i do , dad ?

yeah , i suppose ... dad , who 's harry york ?

i did n't have much to do with it .

lillian ... i 'm more than willing to meet you halfway .

i 'm going back to the hotel .

no , lil . it 's just you ca n't understand their brand of patriotism .

occupation ?

age ?

you 're wasting your time , lady . nothing 's off the record with me .

they 'll mend .

i 'm telling you straight , if you have any serious ambitions , stay clear of the place . it 'll crush you .

that would be okay .

it 's going to be slow from now on . do you know what i mean , harry ?

dad , too . i sold the house . i 'm a faceless sinner , harry ...

how did i look ?

no , harry , it 's not time , it 's us . you and me . and i 'm telling you now that i 'll come to you , okay ? i 'll find you . i will .

yes you do . if you love me you can wait , right ? a month , six months , whatever it takes .

been a lot of years , you know . a long time waiting . for what ? end up feeling like a sap .

i know , but ... there were so many people in there , harry . every time i turned around someone was pressing against me ... watching , looking over my shoulder , touching me , grabbing , sticking things into me . when i feel somebody near me now ... anybody ... my skin starts to crawl .

yeah . i do n't know .

i love you , harry . i love you .

frances , you 're crazy .

no . to thoroughbreds .

you ca n't drink .

you know something , harry ?

i do n't think i 'd be much good in a war ...

... take advantage of me .

this is another one of your schemes to get me off alone ...

couple hours from idaho . we 'll cut across to montana . i 've got friends there with a ranch .

that sure looks like fun ... you know how long it 's been since i was behind the wheel ?

well ... to get a crack at something good , you got ta earn it , you got ta climb the ladder first . so you do , you work hard , and all these people behind you are pushing you up , shouting you on . and then one day you realize you are , you 're at the top ... and there 's nothing there . and you look behind you and there 's no one below . you 're just left there all alone ... swaying in the god-damned breeze .

so you drink , and you fight with a cop ... ?

i do n't know . it hurts , harry . some things , no matter what you do with them , they just hurt .

what for ?

help yourself . everyone else has .

how the hell do you find me anyway ?

two lines ! two fucking lines ! 'my wife returns from europe tomorrow . i ca n't see you any more . ' just like that !

calm down , frances .

frances , you 're a movie star now . if you give them what they want , you can get anything .

dick ... and my mother ! she acts like she 's on mars or something --

yeah .

kaminski .

not bad . but come on , harry ; what 's the real reason ?

come on , harry . this is america , land of the free . i thought we might go skinny dipping . for starters .

what ?

sure . try this acting thing . you can make good money at it .

i kick myself sometimes , but the thing is , i would have been miserable living his life .

do n't be a rat , harry .

you think i 'd miss it ?

harry .

harry .

sure do n't talk like you 're sixteen .

i 'll ... take your word for it . so who are you , then ?

i 'm causing trouble ? ! you 're a pain in the butt ! you newshounds 've been after me and my folks ever since i won that dumb contest . i 'm just sixteen , you know ? who the hell cares what i think ?

run !

yeah .

miss farmer ! in light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation , coupled with the unwarranted assault on the plaintiff here ... i am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the county jail .

miss farmer , is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night ?

you 're farmer ? oh ... well , look , they took your stuff out . moved it to some hotel , i think .

yeah . yeah , tonight i think i got it .

you got it .

you think i got it ?

'how do i know it 's true ? you 'll get to be the champ . they 'll all want you , all the girls ! but i do n't care . i 've been undersea a long time . when they 'd put their hands on me i used to say , `` this is n't it ! this is n't what i mean ! '' it 's been a mysterious world for me ! but joe , i think you 're it ! i do n't know why , i think you 're it . take me home with you . '

i have !

i will , i promise .

little sister , i do n't want you to feel any rush to get back to work . i want you to rest ... for a while anyway .

no , mama , i 'll take care of it . i 'll wash them in the morning .

oh , just leave those things for now .

where are you going ?

nothing . i think i 'll just go out for awhile .

please . i want you to . it would make me so happy .

oh mama , i 'm so ... tired of that song .

frances , you remember my lawyer , alma styles ?

you kill me , mama .

it 's your fan mail , little sister .

well , they needed immediate answers , frances . it 's good manners and good sense . you should n't be bothering yourself with these right now .

i 'll pay your way to new york . i 'll work , i 'll slave . i 'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers , or --

yes ... ?

sedate her .

i want outta here , you understand ? i 'm ready to get out ! so you go back there ... you go back and you tell them to let me out !

you what ?

but you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative . whom do you think i should believe ?

i 'm sorry . she misunderstood , that 's all .

i never said ... oh look . that 's just a figure of speech . she said something funny , and i said ...

just a little joke , miss farmer .

all right . will you please sit down now ? symington says .

i see .

oh ! are you really ?

why , doctor ! we 've only just met !

what ?

what kindness ?

i 've never been shown a kindness . show me one now .

i am as he made me . in his own image .

why do you not go to them ?

why ?

i 'm glad you finally came to the door . a man should n't have to scurry in the shadows .

i 'm sure the lady knows her own mind . does n't she ? let her decide the proper suitor .

there is something i want . a friend .

i do n't know .

there was something at work in my soul which i do not understand .

i see it before me .

fine words from a child killer . you who murdered my brother .

come warm yourself if you like .

are you all right ?

and not a word of them to father . he 's agitated enough not hearing from victor .

it 's been months . it 's not like him .

nothing . still nothing .

one-two-three , one-two-three , twirl- two-three ...

that 's the nature of all progress , william . do n't let your brother sway you otherwise .

claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time . they say he never arrived .

he always was opinionated .

victor , tell me why ! trust me !

no . not tomorrow , not next week , marry me today .

a month at most , that 's all i ask . elizabeth , please . things have not yet resolved . i must take steps to see that they do . for our family 's sake . for our sake . you are life itself . we shall seal our vow . the moment i am done .

not as weak as i .

to be the best there ever was . to push our knowledge beyond our dreams ... to eradicate disease and pestilence ... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear ...

quite a send-off , is n't it ?

give me that child before you fill his head with drivel !

are n't you ?

a warming wind .

then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny .

thank goodness . we 'd be out of work .

yes , do n't worry . i 'll look after your father . you look after her .

quite a place .

nothing in moderation , frankenstein .

everything in moderation , clerval .

thank god your fever broke . slowly , now . just a sip . i 've been worried we might lose you . it 's been touch-and-go for a week .

you 'll be leaving then . just as well . you never were cut out for this , henry . goodbye .

few months perhaps . i 'm gathering the raw materials even now .

we all know how hard you took waldman 's death . even krempe is sympathetic . but it is time to move on . it is time to concern yourself with life .

all the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor !

blasphemy be damned ! waldman spent his life trying to help people !

and here 's to him . everything in moderation , frankenstein .

but you have n't listened , never in history has so much seemed possible . we 're on the verge of answers undreamt of ... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions .

quite a few .

i was just clearing my throat .

i have no knowledge of that .

i have always loved him .

victor frankenstein , sir . of geneva .

philosophical ?

our profession needs talent like yours . destroy your career over an issue of pride ? what a waste .

nonsense . tonight you will draft an apology to professor krempe ...

why ? god alone knows what it means . until it has proven value , it 's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick . hardly fit for the classroom .

electricity .

preposterous .

krempe has a way of provoking my temper .

we are kindred , you and i. men of ambition . let me tell you all that i have lost in such pursuits . i pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man .

lives are ephemeral . the knowledge we gain , the achievements we leave behind ... those live on .

then explain it , whatever it is . it could save the voyage . i 've spent years planning this . my entire fortune .

would-be . i 'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment .

frostbite . gangrene . a simple diagnosis .

i will protect you .

i think we should go wake them up . just in case .

no . there must be some in the desk somewhere .

marcie ?

i 'll go take a look .

i do n't hear it anymore .

help you clean up ?

well , it has n't been that long .

good point .

almost five .

i did n't know i was asleep ... what time is it ?

i do n't know .

what 'll you do when you leave here ?

you okay ?

everybody except the girl who 's supposed to handle the kitchen . annie .

ned ? we 're gon na be working together for a while . you 're a nice guy without all the entertainment , okay ?

no , they wo n't ...

a short somewhere .

you saved my life .

do n't get up . take a second ...

for sure .

ha ! you wily oriental ! the phone was `` mr. watson , come in here , i need you . '' `` what hath god wrought '' was the telegraph .

no wonder they lost america . how could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that ? what 's to eat ?

holy shit ...

i was just wondering if you thought there 'd by any other gorgeous women at camp crystal lake . besides yourself .

umhummmmph .

lead the way !

i thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures . ned is gon na do whatever he wants to do , you know .

i love you .

makes me want to hold on and never let go .

wind 's up . it 's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees .

just a walk , for chrissakes .

wait 'll you 're really in trouble and see what happens ...

girls ca n't be cowboys .

cowboy .

sex is all you ever think of , neddy .

i mean ...

anything else you want ?

good luck .

why not ?

i think water got into the electrical system . you ride me back to camp ? i 'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning .

what was that ?

vacation . i 'm taking him to see his first bullfight .

vamanos !

you like the car ?

i 'm sorry to hear that . what were they , psychos ?

have you ever been there before ?

to keep the daylight out ! this is where they sleep ! get to the door !

thank you , son .

i 'm running the show . i make the plays , and you back the plays i make . stop thinking with your fucking balls . kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ai n't the time to `` go for it . '' i need your cover . cover my ass .

now , you listen to me . you ai n't gon na do a goddamn fucking thing , you hear me ! nobody cares what you think , i 'm running this show , i make the decisions .

they 're gon na kill her anyway . at least now with all these cops we 've got a fighting chance .

i have no idea .

we got about two more hours of day light left . that 'll get us into el paso , which is right next to the border . we 'll stop at a motel --

i promise .

you bet your sweet ass you are , and i 'm gon na help you do it . but we ai n't got much time .

you too , preacher ?

i never said do what i do , i said do what i say .

i 'm gon na just sit here and drain this bottle . and when i 've drunk the last drop , if i still feel then , the way i feel now , i 'm gon na take this bottle and break it over his melon head .

what are you going to do ?

why are you so agitated ?

suit yourself , more for me . scotty ?

who else ?

as long as you 're cool , she 'll be cool . what 're ya gon na say ?

you best better get it done , pops .

i swear to god i wo n't try to escape and i 'll do my best to get you into mexico .

swear to god , on the bible , you wo n't try to escape and you 'll get us across the border .

fair enough . you break your word , i 'll kill all of you . kate , honey !

i can handle richie , do n't worry .

look , dickhead , the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you 're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters . i do n't wan na hafta worry about you all fuckin ' night . and i do n't think you wan na be worrying about my brother 's intentions toward your daughter all night . you notice the way he looked at her , did n't ya ?

you want me to sit here and be passive . the only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if i believe you 'll let us go . i 'm not there yet . you have to convince me you 're telling the truth .

yes .

come on , gim me some more details . how 'd it happen ? some fuckin ' drunk kill her ?

auto wreck .

jacob fuller . jacob , that 's biblical , ai n't it ? what am i askin ' for , of course it is . what are their names ?

yes .

come again ?

it 's okay , honey . everything 's going to be all right .

he 's my son .

what 's the story with you two ? you a couple of fags ?

okay , okay , i promise i 'll do it !

no , i 'm not . i 've been bit . in effect , i 'm already dead .

other places have beds , they also have cable tv , a gym , room service ...

mom 's got nothing to say , she 's dead .

kate , give your old man a little credit . every person who chooses the service of god as their life 's work has something in common . i do n't care if you 're a preacher , a priest , a nun , a rabbi or a buddhist monk . many , many times during your life you 'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself , am i a fool ? we 've all done it . i 'm not going through a lapse . what i 've experienced is closer to awakening . i 'm not trying to shake your faith . i 've just decided not to devote my life to god anymore .

that happens , you 'll get it back .

ai n't it the truth .

you asked me if i would --

what you said to me in the room .

what ?

where are you taking us ?

see ya .

you use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you .

anytime .

watch my back !

we have to go back for daddy !

okay .

yes .

do you believe me ?

why , just look at all this . you got your kitchen --

is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers , that the bureau , the rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally ?

six-fifty .

yeah , and i 'm gon na be right back at it tomorrow . so tonight i 'm gon na sit in front of the box and just drink booze . how much is the bottle ?

is n't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public ?

i was n't scratching !

best in mexico .

no , you 're not . you 're sippin ' margaritas in el ray . but we 're not in el ray . we 're here -- getting ready to go in there . you 're so pleased with yourself about getting into mexico , you think the job 's down . it ai n't . get back on the clock . that 's a fuck-with-you-bar . we hang around there for a coupla hours , in all likelihood , we 'll get fucked with . so get your shit together , brother .

where are you right now ?

really ?

yeah , we were just standing there . you said something about your shoulder hurting , then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes .

you okay ?

i 'm curious . what was the nuttiest thing i did ?

what does that mean ?

duly noted . now , shut up .

i heard it on the radio . we got ta get our asses into mexico tonight . carlos is gon na meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side , then carlos and his boys will escort us to el ray and --

didya look at the border ?

how 's it feel ?

do they have cable ?

what am i supposed to do , seth ? he recognized us .

when i count three , shoot out the bottles behind him !

actually , our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man . he 's a preacher .

go out and bring it in . i feel a song coming on .

uh ... do n't see it . there 's no signature . but hang on -- there 's a note to `` see addendum . '' checking ...

administration , ensign blondell .

just some of the women .

can i ask you somethin ' , lieutenant ? how come you 're doing this ? i mean , we 're kinda curious .

they take you away to san clemente island . half the guys quit when they come back . supposed to be just hell-and-a-half .

of course , but there 's more --

your prerogative , senator .

well , seein 's how this thing is out , you let me handle the r.p.m . from this point forward , i want all press matters coordinated via my office . i 'll be god-damned if i 'm gon na watch hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one . him or the president . this my shade ? `` midnight mahogany '' ? 'cuz i 'm comin ' dangerously close to lookin ' like ronald reagan here .

would you have the discretion to end it right then and there ?

i do n't see how , o'neil . dismissed .

i find this as distasteful as you , lieutenant . but if it 's on my desk , it 's on my shoulders . there 's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty . you should prepare yourself .

you 'll get everything you want , o'neil . let 's see if you want what you 're gon na get .

across the board , sir .

well . 'least now we 're talking the same language . so one standard . is that what you 're after ?

no , sir , what ?

what i resent , lieutenant , is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment . what i resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men ... the day-care center i have to build where an officer 's lounge used to be ... and the ob/gyn i have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears . but most of all , lieutenant , i resent your perfume , however subtle it may be , competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar , which i will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities . does it ?

i think you 've resented me from the start , sir .

it 's this double-standard , the separate quarters , the deferential treatment . it 's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met .

oh , really .

none at this time , sir .

really , i have no problem with --

thank you , sir .

west ?

motherachrist ...

ah , c'mon ...

o'neil . our air 's gon na crap out as soon as we get down there . you know that , do n't you ?

what , we 're gon na pry 'em out with paddles ?

i ai n't gon na shoot her .

shit . think we 're had .

white house boys want a private meeting .

the commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier .

you promise wickwire a fast ticket , too ?

you were never going to let women serve in combat . you always had a safety net . or thought you did .

i 'm saying it 's not going to happen . not when the president is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should i choose to ever campaign against him . he will fry me six ways to sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and , quite possibly , for bringing them back in body bags .

what are you saying ? that a women 's life is more valuable than a man 's ? that a women 's death hurts a family more ?

did you set me up ? did you set me up just to see me fail ?

lieutenant thomas wickwire .

uh , question , ma'am .

thank you , ma'am . um , may i ask what this is regarding ?

`` g.i . jane . '' and which one of you told me she would n't last a week ? huh ?

what the hell is the president trying to do ? steal dehaven 's thunder ?

does n't matter who she picks . no woman is going to last one week in a commando training course . and i do n't care who it is .

montgomery , why do they call you `` flea '' ?

o'neil ?

do n't have to use it , o'neil , but it 's got ta go out . five ... four ... three ...

she 's a women , and that 's why you 're ridin ' her bareback .

automatic five-second deduction , which slips you under the wire . it 's called `` gender-norming , '' o'neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses . where you been the last few years ?

not doin ' them very fine , o'neil .

`` yes , jordan -- i 'll wait for you no matter how long . ''

you do n't crap out of spec-recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country . he 's got a sea daddy somewhere .

well , before you crawl off to die , jordan , give me five minutes of good headwork .

someone screwed you over like this , left unanswered charges hanging over your head , and you 're not gon na fight back ?

c'mon , jordan . do the headwork with me .

the chief ? or maybe even turrentine ? your c.o . ?

i ca n't walk two blocks in washington without hearing about `` g.i . jane . '' you 're all over the place , and whether you wanted it or not , the feminists are sizing you up for that poster .

it 's hard to find time to sleep , royce . much less keep up with my phone life .

sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth . but i 'm trying to be honest , okay ? three years is a long time . do n't ask me to predict how i 'll feel then , jordan , because i do n't know . and either do you .

wai ' , wait . what happens if it works ? four months of training , three years of operational duty . what then ?

get your dick back here . it has everything to do with you .

she 's haze grey and underway ...

royce . we 're the same age , we started the same time -- and now you 're sitting in the upperdecks while i 'm still down in the bullpen . what does that tell you about the navy ?

so why 're you even considering it ? are you ?

is this my glory , sir ?

intel has its own glory , lieutenant -- no matter how subtle .

thank you , sir . we hear back from the pentagon ?

that was good headwork , lieutenant .

only four minutes to neutral waters , sir . why not ?

you 're the analyst for east china , o'neil . analyze .

signals received only sparingly , in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries .

i 'm sorry , o'neil . but as class officer , it 's my obligation to report all violations .

he was married ?

they had to kill 'em ?

one time he was doing a rekkie of the libyan coastline . this is , like , right before we bombed khadaffi into the past tense . so his crew does a nighttime infil , maps all the big artillery placements and stuff , then turns around to get the hell gone . but between them and the water are five libyan guards , all armed to the nuts .

when i was sittin ' behind a desk in washington , it made sense , somehow . blame it on my big brother . he was spec-recon . and the stories he used to tell ...

intagliata was out chasing breakfast . they found his tracks . well , shit .

thanks , wick .

i did n't know they let you try again . especially at your age .

well , now i feel so much better .

maybe half . not even .

'cool ?

i 'm lookin ' , i 'm lookin ' !

what 're you guys doing ? huh ?

o'neil ...

say again ? how many micks ?

managed to activate the elb . if you just radio base and let them know , they 'll fix on that . oh , and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door 's blocked by a reef . over .

sure . just like your men do .

no .

would you have shot if it was a man ?

she led us right to you . that 's no threat ?

are you hungry ? what 's your favorite food ? we 'll try to get it for you .

`` dad . ''

england went out with a stress fracture . that puts you in charge , lieutenant .

it seems the men could n't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs . israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission , often endangering their own lives . they do n't use women anymore .

you heard me . move on .

say again , sir ?

funny , the c.o . says i can .

this ai n't even workin ' wrong !

so am i .

i do n't ... what , someone on base ? a `` mole '' ?

okay , so now work it from the other end . think about california -- and how things might be handled there .

even tough i do n't talk to her every day -- i still talk to her every day . know what i mean ?

this ai n't about some little soldier girl sloggin ' her way through commando school . the implications go way beyond .

hmm . let 's aim higher .

thought you two were file-closed .

me ! ? you where the one ...

audrey , you 're too damned nice , that 's your problem . nice gets you nothin ' in this town . you got ta be a killer to get ahead , you know what i 'm sayin ' ? i 'm sorry , baby , but you just do n't got what it takes .

big bites .

the jfk ? in the rain ! ?

you 're crazy , go to the east side and take the park avenue to the jfk .

oh yes he will .

do n't you think we have enough ?

lucy 'd kill me if she knew .

animal , i ca n't .

yeah , i just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me .

you made a mistake .

it 's all my fault . what have i done , animal ? what have i become ? look at me . this is n't me . i do n't do things like this .

he stole my report ! that 's my report !

what are you doing here ?

you never said it was off the record .

is this cause of me ? because of the story ?

yes . do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time !

i got pretty close .

and you think this creature is one of them ?

when you and i use to attend rallies in college , we helped to create awareness . but from the inside now i can actually effect change . i never lost my idealism .

most people do n't .

you must have quite some harem .

your old sweetheart ?

it 's nick ! i know that guy . i know him !

he 's scum ! as far as he 's concerned you 're just a pair of breasts that talk .

i ca n't believe he put the moves on me . after everything i 've done for him .

you 're kidding , right ?

what 's it to you ?

hey , do you have any glue in your bag ?

mr. caiman , i 've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year . and i 've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me . i 'm too old to be an assistant anymore . i need to know this job is going someplace .

and you 're beautiful ...

did you talk with humphries ?

i do n't think so .

more than that . i believe this is a mutated aberration , a hybrid from the fall out in that region .

not for a long time , now .

really ? a girlfriend then ?

nick , my men and i will hold them here . you will have to go and get help !

allez , allez !

only five , sir . we 've checked them all . he has n't used any of them .

get your people out of there or i will .

well your people are getting in the way of my job .

it may be too late by then . these eggs will hatch very quickly .

um , excuse me , sir , but the situation 's more complicated than that . the blood i recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has .

you know , he 's not an enemy trying to evade you . he 's just an animal .

do n't tell me why it 's not , tell me what the hell it is .

it happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over .

that was a footprint . i was standing inside a footprint .

right . the worm guy . can someone get those people off the beach ?

that thing 's dead . what the hell are we waiting for ?

we 're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body .

that 's not true . our worm guy , er , i mean , dr. tatopoulos found blood .

i understand .

i think we should leave now .

they 've turned off the ventilation system . they 're calling him to dinner .

your talking about the nuclear testing in the pacific .

so why all the secrecy ? why are n't you guys working with the us military ?

i need your trust if you 're to help me find the nest .

we have learned that your american friends have decided not to look for the creature 's nest .

are you looking for this ?

you 'll forgive my impertinence , sir , but even though we had never before met , always considered you as a father to me .

sir ! the pressure . it 's normalizing .

i avoided capture using the mak'tar stealth haze . where is everyone ?

sir , it 's you thank ipthar !

dr. lazarus , here is your surface mapper . i have programed it to the coordinates of a beryllium sphere of sufficient density .

just do n't .

i 'm sorry , sir , i was only-

by grabthar 's hammer , dr. lazarus , i-

well good , that 's very ... nice .

~hex ! alex , are you okav ?

sense memory . i see you got to win the fight ...

... . well you have to figure out what it wants ... what 's its motivation ?

alexander ? ? ? please ? you 're my advisor , advise me !

go ahead !

this much .

what 's the scale ? is that ten miles ? a hundred miles ?

about this much .

do n't be insane , stop ! full stop !

we 've got to stop !

i wo n't and nothing you say-

as a matter of fact , i do . look at their eyes . they 're obviously nocturnal . come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt . so our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31 . '

what 's happened ?

no , jason , that 's a wrap ! there 's nothing to think about !

he wants to think ! ?

what the hell is going on ? ! ! ?

no . i ca n't go out there ! i wo n't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time . i wo n't . i ca n't !

you said `` the commander .

down there .

nobody was watching ?

could they be the miners ?

to see if there 's a pub .

`` go into the cloud ! ...

may i get the check ?

we heard it the first time !

oh my god , it 's real .

a boy comes to the door .

oh ca n't i ? watch me !

dear god ... . how did i come to this ?

i have sectors 1-28. i think hector has the upper levels .

that 's it ?

i 'm at the control oaneh . what do i do ?

go . they 're off again .

wait two seconds then go .

yes ... ?

we 'd never have the budget for this .

yes , i know , and i want you to know i thought about what you said ... i know you meant it constructively but ...

brandon , i remember you from the convention , right ? ... you had a lot of little technical observations about the ship , and i spoke sharply to you ...

yes but , we were wondering-

it 's a television show . okay ? that 's all . it 's just a bunch of fake sets , and wooden props , do you understand ?

commander , as i was saying ... in `` the quasar dilemma '' , you used the auxiliary of deck b for gamma override . but online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix , so we were wondering where the error lies ?

all systems are working , commander .

no , we do n't have an extra beryllium sphere .

negative , no reserve beryllium sphere exists onboard .

the beryllium sphere has fractured under stress .

the enemy is matching velocity .

there is no weather in space .

i just ca n't believe it . any of it ! look at this room ! .. they designed it based on the tuaran pleasure ship from `` historical document '' thirty seven . oh and wait , wait , listen to this ! computer ?

structural damage at 68 percent .

so our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate ! - a two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes !

covalent ... right . so ...

u ... . what do you think ?

a hologram ...

i ... well , uh ... yes , absolutely .

hey commander . listen , we found some beryllium on a nearby planet . we might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion . what do you think ?

you okay , alex ?

where are the miners ?

`` crewman # 6 '' ... call me guy .

jason , are we doing episode 31 or not ?

we made it . commander , we made it . ' m alexander sort ov ) by grabtnar ' s h~mmer , we ove to te ono 'tale .

because it was on the show !

what is that thing ? it serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of choppy crushy things in the middle of a catwalk ! ? . '

jason , we 're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there .

yeah . but i 've got gorignak staring me in the face . i think i can take it though ...

why does this sound so familiar ?

computer , can it be repaired ?

i do n't think that 's a cloud ...

maybe we can lose them in that cloud .

i made the cut the line gesture . you nodded okay . '

mathesar , maybe we should get some of your crew up here .

there 's nobody here . jason ...

it 's not the stuff . i mean , anybody can learn the stuff ... the important thing is commitmnt . 99 % of anything is just committing to it .

who we are . do n't you think they 're going to be pissed ?

wait . when are you going to tell them ?

but i 'm the commander !

closer ? i can try .

i heard it too .

i have one job on this lousy ship . it 's stupid , but i 'm going to do it . got it ?

you got ta admit , they do love him .

tomorrow morning , before the store opening .

accelerate to mark 4 , tommy .

simpler .

explain -

please , do n't hurt them , it 's not their fault . i 'm not the commander , i do n't know anything .

do you think i 'm a fool ? that the commander does not know every bolt , every weld of his ship ?

prepare a tear harness for the female ...

deliver the device now or i will destroy your ship .

better than my lieutenant . he failed to activate ship 's neutron armor as quickly as i 'd hoped on our last encounter .

okey dokey , let 's fire blue particle cannons full . fire red particle cannons full . fire gannet magnets left and right . fire pulse catapults from all chutes . and throw this thing at him too , killer .

the ship is a model ... as big as this ! ... a very clever deception indeed ! he oa n't oontaln his lauchter . a belle -- -- -tommy set a course for home , lommander ?

sections of rooms made of plywood . our beryllium sphere was painted wire and plaster . the digital conveyor was christmas lights ... decorations . it 's all a fake . i 'm not him ... i 'm a nothing . a nobody .

a model , only as big as this .

we have become aware of these concepts only recently . in our dealings with sarris . often sarris will say one thing , and do another . promise us mercy and deliver destruction ... it is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost . but if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with sarris .

well ... sort of ...

mathesar ? what is that ?

former commander ?

no , thank god he has not .

mathesar ? . .. has sarris seen the.. historical records ?

it 's perfectly safe . i promise .

theramin .

yeah . `` earth . '' time to get back to `` earth , '' kids .

sir , i understand this is a terrible breach of protocol , but please , i beg you to hear our plea . we are thermians from the klatu nebula . our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by roth ' h'ar sarris of fatu-krey . sarris wants the omega 13. we are to meet in negotiation . however our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous . the flames , the death ... please captain , you are our last hope . we have secured a limousine .

pedal to the metal ...

we 've got to get out of here . c'mon , hurry

go for the eyes . like in episode 22 with-

how about the pig-lizard ?

all right , gwen , alex , fred , follow me . guy , set up the perimeter . tommy , you keep a lookout , make a signal if they come back .

do your best , tommy ...

faster tommy . get us out of here !

lieutenant lathe , i confess i am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself . chasing across the universe to obtain what is , i am now certain , a bauble of fiction . tell me how best to obliterate this vessel ? i would like nothing to remain .

what does she see in them ?

same old story .

they 're ready . believe me , the ones that stayed on here at valley forge are ready for anything . of course , we get nothing from congress . they need boots , coats ... we desperately need food .

well , george , who were you ?

we 're so damned important ! look at us -- nathanael , you were a horse- shoer , benedict , before this ?

after visiting congress i know what it 's like being violated by come disproportionate asses ! ah , if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table ...

christ , george , joseph reed 's been writing letters back to congress attacking you . your own aide !

then , i need you . we all do . without your victory the men would have no hope at all .

the army needs you .

we 're in bad shape , benedict , moral is low . before i can do anything , i need lee and his seven thousand troops . i 've ordered him to join us three times . in my last letter i all but begged him to come here . the man is insubordinate .

why in hell would john do that ? why in hell would any of them do that ? after all you 've done , it 's unbelievable !

i 've come to report that we 've had a bit of luck !

it comes down to leaders . if our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe ; if they go into the forests with the troops , eat what they eat , fight with them , perhaps to die ? the most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation .

ben franklin 's going to paris , but i think the french will be long on talk and short on guns . our troops are mobs , they wo n't take orders , have no equipment ... could they beat the british ?

and a french alliance ?

wil , i 'm giving you your freedom . do you understand ?

yes , general ?

what ? what are you talking about ?

misunderstood what ! ?

yes , general . but if you have to shoot somebody , you ca n't .

you , you just need a new flint , general .

negroes ? washington has black men in his army ? are they good fighters ? what 's that red ribbon on his arm , colonel ?

and , is that a pitchfork beside him ?

no , my lord .

marquis ! get these men reformed , send steuben and wayne out on the left ...

lafayette will not be happy ...

you 're asking me to be president of a republic , not king ? not a dictator over subjects ?

that 's why the people trust you george . without someone at the convention , who has the people behind him , everything will fail . will you do it ?

have you decided if you are going to join the virginia delegation to the constitutional convention ?

what 's your advice , alexander ?

he warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against congress . george , the time has come for you to declare yourself king of america . listen to me , the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne ! george , you must declare yourself with us or against us .

george , remember that night when we were drinking with arnold ?

what is this ?

i am not conscious of it , sir ! but since you have thought it necessary to tell me so , we part !

sir , i think no such thing .

general greene is here . there are two other divisions here .

we better , congress invented him .

well , sir , then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear .

i 'll be twenty next year , sir .

hamilton , you 're going to have to cover our asses as we cross .

is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went ?

they are ... friends of congress .

if he supports the british why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them ? unlike general lee ... who you and congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent !

as does your ability , horatio . we must talk further , when it 's more convenient .

again , just to touch on a touchy subject , but ... would the people accept another leader over washington ?

you think that ?

i tell you every damned place i go the man is adored ! `` general washington ! champion of trenton ! savior of the republic ! '' and you should hear the way people are deprecating congress !

hancock led the boston 'tea party ' because he 's a goddamned tea smuggler ! he was n't protesting inequality , he was eliminating competition . now , you listen to me : we need to get a southerner elected commander-in-chief , or the south will not fight ! what have we been struggling for all these years ? for this moment ! and , if we fail now , remember : you stopped us !

what 's the difference ?

i hear general lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in new york -- why wo n't he come on ! ?

the man is a traitor !

understand ? you need to be listening to people like john adams , and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind !

and , hamilton ? greene ?

general lee , sir !

i rode here , on my horse .

well , we will accept these charming little gifts . when we see them . meanwhile , please , take your pick of a horse .

sir , these are our finest firearms from the armory at charleville ! they are a gift from the people of france !

muskets and uniforms and bayonets .

i am . then , i understand you too serve without salary . you know , since your charming little victories at trenton and princeton , the french court is softening . i expect any time now a ship load of supplies ...

no , please ; an advance on your salary .

i ... they look both the same .

we have more officers created by congress than we know what to do with .

i want you to see our hospital .

come out and meet my soldiers . they 're good people .

martha ! for god 's sake !

well , we must keep in mind the dower laws . one third of everything we have is mine and since our negroes have been interbreeding , it would be legally impossible to distinguish them .

martha ... what ?

it 's an anti-christian dogma ! i can not believe you are so calm about it !

and have you heard anything from our dear friend , sally ? what with all the rumors getting back to england . i thought she might inquire after us . but then i believe she always looked down on us .

when you lived with the fairfaxes ?

but , as usual , it will not go well for ... them . martha , you must trust me .

the day tom jefferson frees a slave i 'll ride naked through the streets of williamsburg on a mule . tom jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small . the only man out there who really does what he says is sam adams and everyone thinks he 's crazy . believe me , this 'disturbance ' is n't going to last long . you have to understand , congress is a chicken coop full of foxes , martha , each and every one has his eye on a nice , fat prize .

you know , i came back to mount vernon to retire . i do n't need to be in government .

sir , i have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform ...

i 'm honored , but , reluctant to leave you .

at one time i could have chosen not to be .

you do n't believe i can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism ?

i certainly did n't mean you . of course you are a gentleman , an officer and a gentleman .

really ? which precious homily was it ?

now that is a lie ! see how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet ! when you break off your engagement to martha curtis , i 'll divorce william ! do you hear ? you get what you want from this world , then throw it all away on love !

george , you know i only love you , but ...

that 's not what i said ! now , sally , you 're embarrassing me ! watch out for her , george ; she talks refinement , but she has a barbarous soul !

george , i 'm sorry .

so , you are william 's wild young neighbor ? or should i say , 'brother ' ; william claims you as a member of his family . i have heard so many unflattering tales about you , and i understand , that except for you , this 'family ' is quite cultivated .

that 's good ... who ?

i 'm lost in ecstasy ! and dost thou love , thou charming maid ?

it 's stupid , of course .

in the minuet , george , every movement is significant , like the strut of cranes ...

africa ? that 's so far ? how do they get here ?

is that your test of patriotism , george ; if a man will die for you ?

are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war ? you know why i do n't trust revolutions ? because each of us is who we are : we make speeches , print pamphlets , and we never change . the world is not a philosophical abstraction , mister adams , it 's us . and , i do n't believe you can ever change human nature .

who says so ?

just because they are born ?

all people have rights !

you are a slave owner ! you have been illegally surveying lands beyond the ohio valley ! that land belongs to the natives !

for god sake , get that horrid stuff off your face . you look like a damned slave ! it 's damned humiliating .

my daughter , i ask only ...

you 're kidding me , right ?

an oldsmobile silhouette .

what is this ?

hey , he should have a weapon , a knife or something .

calm down , bear ...

you get life for kidnapping .

no . what 's this ?

just do what i told you and meet me back here at midnight .

after this one , i 'm out , cat , you understand ? this is the last time we talk to each other .

i heard in the federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your daddy on father 's day .

you see the paper ?

he knew it was a set up . he was ready for it .

they all sound big at the talking stage .

yeah , well , i 'm bored , bear . i wan na make movies .

cat , that 's the lamest idea i 've ever heard .

you see that ? the way the man just went right over ?

so ... how many movies you been in ?

i have to ask you for that key .

maybe your nephew panicked , took off .

a zillion , huh ? that 's a lot .

sure . family . i know how that goes .

only this time , no john wayne and dean martin shooting the bad guys in el dorado .

what ?

she 's great . gim me the money .

in the can . that the money ?

alright , bo . you can have the money ... but it 's not here . i have to go get it .

three .

i ca n't believe the way you guys do business out here . i ca n't believe how fucked up your organization is .

what about her ?

there 's ilona .

i 'm with you on that . and do n't you think it needs a good female part ? increase the romance angle .

yeah , morgan freeman . but he 's a colored guy .

harvey keitel . yeah . maybe . he was pretty good in the movie `` fingers '' .

yeah , we 're getting martin .

says here you 're getting martin weir for the part of lovejoy .

that 's funny , i was just wondering what i was gon na break of yours to get it away from you .

that 's what i thought . so let me put it this way ...

i do n't know .

last night . when he called me over to your office to talk about it .

yeah , i hear you bagged martin weir for mr. lovejoy .

you must be makin ' some big deals , doin ' lunch in a place like this ?

bo . i 'm great . listen , i 'm expecting some people -

you positive about that ?

by friday , man , or you 're fuckin ' dead as disco .

that 's correct . look at me .

or else use your fucking imagination .

or else what ?

who ?

i work for harry zimm , alright ?

yeah ? well , trust me . i 'm very for real .

who the fuck are you ?

get him out 've here .

that 's what i 'd do . make sure i got the right guy next time .

that 's right .

harry , if i gave you leo 's money you 'd have ray bones all over your ass and then you 'd be in a whole new kinda trouble .

i found him .

i mean , at least bo 's invested in three of my movies .

cash . it happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport .

get the fuck outta my chair .

his shrink 's trainer .

i said i 'd think about it . what does that mean ? in this town , nothing .

you do n't say any more ' n you have to . you say , 'well , i 'm glad you assholes stopped by , so i can set you straight . '

no leave 'em up , we want the light in their eyes . i 'll be at the desk ... but do n't introduce me , let it go , just start talking . you 're gon na be here , behind 'em when they sit down .

what do you get out of this ?

i 'm not gon na pop her , harry .

so you 're thinking what if i was to put you next to my dry cleaner . ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie .

no , his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed mt . whitney .

one of his best parts .

a blockbuster . but quality . no mutants or maniacs . this one 's gon na be my `` driving miss daisy '' .

because they 're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint . the first thing they 'd do is break my legs .

harry , look at me .

ever shot anybody .

what does that mean ?

they always paid .

part of it , yeah .

so he comes to l.a ...

that 's right . as a matter of fact ...

without him . the guy 's so out of it he does n't even know it 's gone .

it 's the kind of situation , you do n't pay , you get your legs broken .

you want to hear this idea ? it 's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand . go on , tell her .

you 're not looking at me , harry .

we 're there , harry . you signed markers for a hundred and a half , you 're over sixty days past due and you have n't told anybody what the problem is .

did you stop to think what if i had a heart attack ?

exactly . you either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket , i do n't give a fuck . you do n't ever hand me a book with a miss in it .

it was in the herald .

yeah , he told me .

yeah , i like it , i 'm high up , i can see everything , you know ? it 's the cadillac of minivans .

it 's not that simple . you have to be careful . there 's another guy that comes along , a hard-on you owe some money to . a mob guy . wants to take you out anyway , on account of a past situation .

so when do i meet up with the husband and give him the look ?

good-looking , too . like karen .

like this ?

no , i want you to look at me the way i 'm looking at you . put it in your eyes , 'you 're mine , asshole , ' without saying it .

i 'm looking at you .

what happened ? the pressure got to you ?

martin , i 'm not connected to those people anymore . not since i walked out of a loanshark operation in miami .

yeah . kinda . anyway , once i have the authentic sounds of speech , the rhythms , man , the patois , i can actually begin to think the way those guys do , get inside their heads .

you mean like we do n't give a shit .

martin . it was a beautiful role . all i had to do was find the character 's center , the stem i 'd used to wind him up and he 'd play , man , he 'd play .

it 's all mine .

you 've been losing .

i would n't think you 're that dumb , leave over three hundred grand in the closet , underneath the extra blanket , but i guess you are .

mr. barboni is a good customer . works for jimmy capp .

you see a black leather jacket , fingertip length , like the one pacino wore in serpico ? you do n't , you owe me three seventy-nine .

go get your stuff .

i 'll go . i 'll go .

yeah , harry , you look like you belong in one of your horror movies .

harry , what 're you doing ? you 're supposed to be in the hospital .

what kinda food they serve at this ivy place anyway ?

i think you could be an actor . i know you 're acting sometimes , but you do n't show it .

yeah . there 's a girl in it now .

that 's a different story . i 'm still working on that one , you know , getting the visual fabric just right . although i 've added to it .

that was martin . he wants to have lunch tomorrow . that is , if you can make it .

a locker at the airport ? jesus christ , harry . tell me you 're not really that stupid .

yeah . we understand you read the script and like it ... a lot .

why does anyone want to be in movies ?

i want to know .

sounds fair .

you and harry 'll make a great team . i 'm gon na make a deal with him .

i got you a copy of the script .

yeah . right . listen , `` touch of evil '' 's playing near my hotel . you wan na go check it out ? watch charlton heston play a mexican ?

well , i got ta have a talk with leo , my runaway dry cleaner .

yeah , well martin is known for his flipping . he flips over a script , and when the time comes to make a deal , he flips out .

you read harry 's new one ? he says it 's the best thing he 's ever read .

you saw that one ?

no , no ... you left the patio door open . you got ta stop doin ' that , all the nice things you got around here .

how much is the wife offered ?

that 's right . three percent .

i 'm going into the movie business .

he already knew it .

all i know is he came by the barber shop , all fuckin ' undone , wanting to know where you were staying in vegas . i told him i do n't know . i still do n't .

i hate to say i told you , but i did . i told you do n't start nothing with him that time .

do n't say a fuckin ' word .

i told you not to -

hey , chili . get your coat , but do n't piss the guy off , okay ? it could get complicated and we 'd have to call momo to straighten it out . then momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we do n't need that .

what she did not say was , ' i just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin ' seasick . ' all she cared about was that look . all she remembered was that look . and why do we remember things in movies ? because we can see them .

whatta you mean , whose point of view ; the audience 's point of view .

how honorable of you .

so this means you 've reconsidered our deal on mr. lovejoy ?

murray 's dead .

i mean morally . murray was my friend .

i 'm not sure how i feel about this , doris .

come on in .

well , are n't you gon na offer me whatever it is you taste like ?

hello , doris .

'we ? '

oh , yeah , sure .

harry -

what money ?

i have to run . but what i hope to see , they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money . it becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it , but in the end they ca n't . can they ?

but you are interested ?

'it ' did n't slip away , martin , you did ... when you went off to fuck nicki in the middle of my birthday party .

yeah and i 'm wondering , how did it go wrong ? how did it all ... slip away ?

hello , martin .

karen . wow . look at you ...

roger , arctic warrior . i say again , our records indicate the passenger vessel chimera was lost at sea . over .

a passenger liner , north island . over .

affirmative , arctic warrior . what type of vessel ?

arctic warrior , arctic warrior , arctic warrior . this is united states coastguard station north island . over .

after fifty years there ai n't nothin ' left but shoe leather .

what day is it ?

yeah . hell , what difference does it make if we report it now or later ? we call this in now , gon na be coastguard , fbi , who knows who , all over the place .

it 's a beautiful country . very clean . very civilized . and cold .

looks like it took out the backup genny too .

one minute i 'm minding my own business , the next thing i know the whole place is burning up . an oxygen tank must 've blown on the welder . started an oil fire .

how about now ?

hear that , dodge ? epps do n't think it 's a problem .

what say , epps ? you up for some roasted albatross ?

i 'm no doctor . but i 'd say he 's in a coma .

oh yeah .

smokes ?

pretty handy with that scatter gun , epps . you raised on a farm ?

i 'm saying we got ta do whatever we got ta do to preserve our interest .

or uninvited guests .

yeah , well how the hell you get something like that wrong ? that 's a damn big boat . it 's either sunk or it ai n't .

if this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago , we just hit the jackpot .

bring it on , dude .

what ?

where from ?

sorry .

if money can buy what he wants .

look , i did n't touch it . alright ?

i think you know .

there 's no way we 're gon na hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the coastguard here . besides , it 'll be safer where it is .

what do you propose ?

i guess the best strategy 's just to tell them the truth .

if they knew what they were carrying .

not me .

i think you better see this for yourself .

do what you need to do . just do it fast .

could be meant as a warning .

bodies 're too fresh .

if somebody 's aboard her already , she ai n't ours . she 's theirs .

sounds like the hull .

dreamin 's all any of you 're gon na be doing if we do n't get this boat running .

a salvage claim to a vessel 's cargo 's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself . it 's ours .

either way , they must 've had a pretty good reason .

did n't happen yesterday , i 'll tell you that . torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat .

it 's a full 2500 horses down . we could n't drag that boat down hill on ice with it .

i 'm telling you , you do n't want to be running that fan like it is .

like i always say --

how much longer 's that gon na take ?

the number one turbine 's pretty well trashed . number two runs , but it 's way underpowered .

threw a turbine blade .

the damn thing 's been floating around for god knows how long and it has n't hit anything yet . so we take it easy . a little of the old push pull .

it 's a risk i 'm willing to take .

smugglers maybe .

what the hell would a freighter be doing up here ? it 's way out of the lanes . there 's not a port for 800 miles .

i ca n't believe you . dodge 's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share .

nothing . let 's get outa here .

that 's what i call a payday .

you mean , before she sank .

i bet you did .

i think i see it pretty well .

what happened ?

hard to say which is worse , staying here or taking our chances in open water .

why you ? how come the rest of us have n't seen these people ?

what 's that supposed to mean ?

something bad happened here , murphy .

what do you think happened on this boat ?

wish i could say the same .

it 's not gon na hold us .

it 's a good bet they 'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too .

if it was a ship she hit .

maybe the other ship took the worst of it .

the page 's missing . then their sos was real .

`` their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision . distress calls have been made . ''

february first .

smashed it up pretty bad .

if they were close enough to shore , they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats .

i do n't know . no . not greer . somebody .

no cowboy shit up there , understand ?

dodge , get on that turbine . i do n't care if you do n't sleep for a week . the sooner you 're done , the sooner we can get out of here . how 's the food situation ?

it was n't you . it was somebody else . there 's somebody else aboard .

there 's somebody else on this boat .

the guy . he just came this way .

did you see him ?

why not call for help ?

yeah . thanks .

the law 's on our side . if they want to challenge it , let them try .

it 's my pen name .

candy ?

all i 'm saying is that gold 's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was .

what about the gold ?

a what ?

we heard you scream . any idea what you might 've seen ?

what happened ?

lost my sea legs .

greek citizen . merchant navy . obviously we are n't the first to come across this ship . they probably stumbled across it just like we did .

pretty low all around .

would you hold on just a minute here , please ? look , there 's no reason to panic now . epps saw somebody . fine . it 's a big boat . chances 're real good he does n't even know about the gold . if we stay cool , nobody 'll be the wiser . the gold stays where it is til we 're ready to go . like i said , it 'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here .

let 's just take it easy here , alright ? nobody 's gon na kill anybody .

fifty million four ways . that 's twelve million and change a piece . what you gon na do with your share , skipper ?

and get a bunch of fools sniffin ' around here ?

dodge , you got ta get on those repairs .

so what ? we gon na unload the gold and get a move on ?

some classy tub in it 's day , huh ?

so we cut her loose and wait it out . a little weather could n't be anything she has n't seen before .

we 've done it before .

call the coastguard ?

looks like it 's adrift .

i must be in the wrong business .

let the buyer beware .

of course they did .

the number nine on the starboard side 's half flooded . epps says it 's a slow leak just under the waterline , about twenty gallons an hour . they must 've pumped it before we left sitka .

i heard you . but i 'm choosing to ignore you . epps , let 's go .

did n't you hear me , grandpa ? or you got your hearing aid turned down ?

why n't you mind your own business , chief .

what seems to be the trouble , ladies ?

no , no . you got leak .

i was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry , i 'll be completely out of her life in a few days .

are you going to yell at me ?

pumpkin , are you in there ?

nothing .

i-i really have to get up early for class tomorrow .

god , how horrifying .

yup .

not the maxine ?

did i tell you who i ran into at the bagel place ?

well , i think it 's good to keep all your options open . you can always enroll for the winter quarter . you could even live here and go to the city college part time , and still get a job if you wanted to .

look , i told you i 'm not going to college .

i ca n't believe this ! i thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me !

it 's just that i feel like it 's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out .

hello ...

do n't be silly , anyone can dance . here , just follow me ... watch my feet .

yeah ... where is this ? bosnia ?

oh i love to cook . i guess most women would n't invite a man over on the first date , but i believe you should trust your instincts . when i talked to you on the phone you just seemed so ... i do n't know ... harmless . ready for ice cream ?

well they 're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition ... but do n't worry -- i 'm sure i 'll be able to get you your diploma in the fall !

help me what ?

enid ! i 'm so sorry about what happened .

i ...

... wow ...

i see ... interesting ...

jesus ...

it 's not optional !

look , we do n't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job .

i do n't think we should ... look , you have to totally promise me you wo n't tell becky about this .

why do all guys have to play stupid guitars ? it 's so typical ... either they 're into cars or guns or sports or guitars ... it 's so obvious ...

do you want something to drink ?

i just stopped in to say hi .

no .

yeah , right .

this is the ultimate . it 's like the taj mahal of bad , fake 50 's diners .

so josh , will you give us a ride ? please ? pretty please ? it 's going to be super fun !

well hello there , young employee of the sidewinder .

make sure you 're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do ... oh yeah ! i have to show you something else !

it 's fine .

i do n't know ... i was thinking maybe i should live alone . i decided to rent that place we looked at . i 'm moving in next week .

because you 'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it .

great ...

where are we ? this is a weird neighborhood ...

yeah well , you said you were busy ... look , i 'd better get going ... i 'll call you tomorrow .

how repulsive !

oh yeah ... maybe ... seymour 's going on his big date tonight and i kind of want to be around when he calls , so i can hear how bad it went .

do you still want to go to that thing tonight ?

do n't you want nice stuff ?

i ca n't afford stuff like this right now .

i am not -- i just think it 'd be funny to see what he 'd do ...

oh my god , i remember this hat ... this was during your little old lady phase ...

get away from me !

like what ?

yeah , well ... so when are you going to get your job ?

god , how can you stand all these assholes ?

that guy is totally amazing .

no way ... when ?

anthony 's ii !

you wo n't believe it ! guess !

wait ...

if i promise you there 's really a party with a lot of guys , do you promise you 'll go ?

i do n't believe you .

let 's get out of here , this place makes me sick .

how about this ?

how about this one ?

yeah , he 's beyond human stuff like that .

josh !

just promise you 'll do it .

i 've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we 're like these totally rich yuppies ...

somewhere downtown .

that was truly pathetic .

gross !

ew , look at this ...

come on , it 's too late now ...

the w.c. fields fan club newsletter ... oh my god , the national psoriasis foundation !

i 'm afraid if i see him , i 'll start feeling really bad again .

it 's obviously him !

i 'm going to tell him you said that .

i know , look at the way he drives ... he 's like an old man .

god , i think josh is too mature for us .

you 're better at it .

why do i always have to do it ?

i can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch ?

what a little hosebag .

you lent it to me in like tenth grade .

jesus ! listen to this one : `` do you remember me ? airport shuttle , june 7th . you : striking redhead with yellow dress , pearl necklace , brown shoes . i was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens . am i crazy , or did we have a moment ? ''

okay , well here 's yours ... `` who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken ? not this one ! stunning bod , very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer . ''

i might actually get the pasta special .

hey , look at this ...

okay , okay !

that lets us off the hook .

you know , sacrifice virgins and stuff ...

i know , it has n't really hit me yet .

god , it 's so weird that we 're finally out of high school ... we 've been waiting for this our whole life ! now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want . it 's such a weird feeling .

soon ... i have to wait and see how this summer class goes .

so , when are we going to start looking for our apartment ?

look at these people behind you . i 'm totally convinced they 're satanists .

shut up !

just think , we 'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again .

remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year ? i did n't think that just because you get an `` f '' that means you have to take the class over again .

these assholes are saying that i have to go to summer school and take some stupid art class !

what ? ... oh suck my fucking dick !

god , what a bunch of retards ...

my acting workshop is across the street from here . i 'm just on my break .

oh my god , what are you guys doing here ?

oh my god , you guys ! i ca n't believe we made it !

i want to know what you think you 're doing , staying out all night and worrying your father to death !

shhh !

i 'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards .

it 's kind of falling apart .

you still interested in that ?

him . seymour . he 's the man with the records .

do you have any other old records besides these ?

a what ?

oh , how `` punk . ''

yeah yeah yeah . do you have my money ?

that 's not even --

punk rock is over !

yes .

later , `` dude '' .

you 're late , asshole .

well , if it is n't enid and rebecca , the little jewish girl and her aryan friend .

why do you even want it ? it would look stupid on you .

well why do i care about that ?

you 're crazy -- it should be like two dollars !

what ?

i can treat him any way i want to - i 'm an adult ! leave me alone !

i was just thinking out loud ... i mean , you 've got this whole thing with dana -- i 'm not going to let you fuck that up ...

what do you want ?

what do you want ?

who cares ? let 's just go ... what 's stopping us ?

what ?

what about joe ?

... maybe i should just move in here with you ... i could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until i get a job .

god , she 's going to kill me ... this bottle is half-empty !

fuck dana . i 'm sick of dana .

that 's dana 's - i 'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary . you better not --

what about this ?

in what way do you mean ?

i ... i do n't think so .

what 's her problem anyway ? did she actually tell you you could n't see me ?

well , you know ... what do i know about clothes ... i 've never been the most fashionable guy -- it 's nice to have someone do all the work for me ...

i ... i wish i could , enid , but i really ca n't right now ... i -- it 's just that i --

... i better not ...

really ?

actually , it 's kind of still happening ... she 's over here right now ... i think everything 's going pretty well ...

well , uh ... i 'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real !

how can you be so sure ?

i wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them ?

i wo n't even dignify that with a response .

actually , i 've got a total crush on this one guy right now , but it 's a really fucked-up situation ...

then again , that 's easy for me to say , since i 'll never even get a date . i 'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you .

never ...

maybe now you understand why i ca n't get a date .

what is that ?

what ? why ?

no , in a lot of ways things are better now ... i dunno ... it 's complicated . everybody still hates each other , but they know how to hide it better , or something ...

i make enough money to eat and buy old records ... what more do i want ?

for nineteen years ...

`` four-piece cook 's special deep fried with side n ' slaw it 's out ray-geous '' !

`` yet . ''

it does n't matter , i 'm not staying long ... i just want to make sure i convince you not to give up yet .

jesus ...

what did you tell that girl ?

well , offer her a seat ! you want me to do it ?

jesus , seymour .

these are older women just dressed up to look young ... i think .

i 'm just not one of those guys who has a `` type '' ...

okay , what about this one ? are you into girls with big tits ?

good luck ...

yeah , well sure ... you can if you want to ... it 's just i do n't want all these guys in there at once ... you know ...

no ! ! !

oops ! i dropped it !

yeah , that 's good too ... the whole record was good , but that one song , `` devil got my woman '' -- i mostly just keep playing that one over and over ... do you have any other records like that ?

nah , it 's not so great . here 's the one i 'd recommend .

is this one any good ?

sure , i guess .

those are all 78s ... can you play 78s ?

you know , like weird 1960 's indian rock n ' roll music .

indian records ?

right .

call me sometime .

yeah .

right , exactly !

i am .

what fake blind date ? what are you talking about ?

what are you talking about ?

thank you , doctor .

-at last you 're right- we do- you are the problem in tsavo-

-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate i persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate i have decided to stay-

-oh , sing a different song , abdullah- -there 's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-

we 'll have to make them come to us , wo n't we ? and since there are two of them , we 're going to set two plans in motion . first : we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night .

starting now , we attack them .

-not a time for modesty , bob-

every man who 's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him , the lions will be dead .

what ?

and it worked ?

i did n't conceive of it for the lions- i built one in india when there was trouble with a tiger .

genius- the beast will enter , tripping the wire , the door will slide down , trapping him , you , safe behind the bars , will have him at your mercy and will shoot him .

i 'm calling it my `` contraption '' - we 're going to surround it with a boma- a fence , to you- and we 're going to leave a small opening opposite that door .

it has n't been that simple so far .

it 's what the natives are calling the lions- -two lions have been causing trouble-

pleasant journey ?

you wo n't have the chance . any further words of encouragement ? then i 've a train to catch .

my wife is the game player in the family , sir .

john henry patterson , come in . i 'm robert beaumont . firm- i like that , tells me a lot about you- -now why do n't you tell me about me ? to get you started , many people find me handsome , with a wonderful smile . i 'm sure you agree . winning personality , heaps of charm ?

who else would hire me ? beat you to it , did n't i ? oh yes , almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift .

you intend `` sorting this out '' tonight ?

-then he feasted on him , starting with his feet-

i 'm david hawthorne , this is my hospital . and my advice to you is , `` do n't get sick in front of it . '' that was meant to be charming , sorry . i seem to have lost the knack .

then we agree .

i have been desperate for patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived .

-is it , i 'm sorry , but then , of course , you 're the doctor , you should know .

go , now . such a gentleman .

-oh please- if i 'd been against your taking this , you would have abandoned me . you 've been desperate to see africa your whole life .

we 're not much good at goodbyes , helena .

-i would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-

we all worked together . worthy deeds were accomplished . i liked the labor . my mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman 's heart when i turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands . i like the blood , is that strange ?

what a good week .

second death ? where ? -

that 's what the books say ...

are n't we full of ourselves today ? i think it 's because of the lion .

john ? i know this is n't the time to ask , but-

i hate to be a bother , john , but the cramp 's getting worse . the pain is actually quite unbearable now .

we know three things about man-eaters . first , they always return to where they 've attacked before . second , they 're always old- they ca n't catch other animals so they turn to us . and third , they 're always alone- they 've been cast out by their pride because they ca n't keep up .

well , he put me in a spot , did n't he ? but that 's all right- after all , i 'm responsible for everything that happens here . and it certainly wo n't do much for morale if a man-eater 's on the prowl .

i could n't believe it when you said `` sort it out . '' as if it were the most normal thing in the world . `` ho-hum , what lovely tea , i think i 'll bag a killer beast this evening , nothing much else going on anyway . ''

i 've got medical supplies to deliver . come along to the hospital when you 're done .

we all have our reasons . mine is simply to make them understand happiness , accept salvation , know the serenity that comes- -best i stop . one of the by-products of my belief is that i can become amazingly boring . but i know god smiles on me .

beaumont says it 's to end slavery .

i 've lived in africa a year and i do n't know what you know . how long have you been here ?

many thanks . you 're patterson , yes ? nigel starling- i 'll be assisting you at tsavo- but surely beaumont must have told you that .

the most of any lions ... a hundred ... ? probably more . johnny ... ?

why ?

was that supposed to make me feel better ?

i 'll have to .

nobody 's seen anything like this . lions do n't have caves like this- -they 're doing it for pleasure .

in my town , when i was little , there was a brute , a bully who terrorized the place . but he was not the problem . he had a brother who was worse than he . but the brother was not the problem . one or the other of them was usually in jail . the problem came when they were both free togther . the two became different from either alone . alone they were only brutes . together they became lethal , together they killed .

it would have been a beautiful bridge , john . i never noticed before , occupied with other business , i suppose ... ... never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but i 've had the time today , nothing else on , and this ... it 's graceful and the placement could n't be prettier ... and ...

but of course yours worked .

it 's all right . stay ready . they know it 's there .

... do n't know ...

... misfire ... it jammed ...

it was probably luck- i 'd rather you did the shooting .

i 'm always considerate- my mother taught me that .

that 's very considerate .

i do n't really . but understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out- -when i 'm gone , you 'll still have to build the bridge . and i do n't want the men to have lost respect for you .

we need to talk .

since his beard was red .

thank you , samuel .

oh yes , i think so .

you do n't know what tsavo means , do you ? it means `` slaughter '' ...

you- they can not believe you 're still here .

did it look like this in your mind ?

some russian princes want to hunt the himalayas . you ?

and where will you sleep beautifully ?

i do n't believe you had a mother .

why do you laugh ? - you do n't believe she taught me ?

many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance , but after a while i believe we could learn to love each other . think about it .

i know . marry me , dana , and together we will raise vigo as our son . there are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god . i 'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment . and perhaps a car and free parking .

everybody has a choice .

i do n't believe we have the luxury of choice .

no , everything 's fine . honestly . thanks anyway .

do you need anything ? you want me to come in ?

okay , i 'll take a raincheck on that .

thank you , janosz . i 've learned a lot here , but now that my baby 's a little older , i was hoping to rejoin the orchestra .

oh , yes , i got in a little late this morning , janosz .

thank you .

i wo n't .

venkman ? i think he was borderline for a while there . then he crossed the border .

thank you , frank . oh , are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom ? i asked you last week .

you 're also a human being , frank .

finally came to your senses , huh ?

do n't worry . janine has a very special way with children .

maybe i should call janine .

i 'm not even good for me .

oh , peter , i did n't dump you . i just had to protect myself . you really were n't very good for me , you know .

so -- are you making any new year 's resolutions ?

i 'll put him down for you . you are way too short ! and your belly-button sticks out ! you 're nothing but a burden to your poor mother !

for me it 's best if i sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me . if we go the other way i 'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night .

this is joe namath 's old number , you know . you could get a lot of chicks with this . just do n't pee in it .

you know , if anyone else told me that , i 'd have serious doubts . but coming from you , i ca n't honestly say i 'm surprised .

he was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman . i hate this painting . i 've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage .

i did n't paint it . i 'm just cleaning it . it 's an original ver meer . it 's worth about ten million dollars .

that 's where the buggy stopped .

brings back a lot of sweet memories , does n't it ? there 's our old cash machine . and the dry cleaners we used to go to . and the old video store . we really had some good times , did n't we ?

i 'll supervise .

i 'll do it .

he did n't `` ditch '' me . we had some problems , he got a good offer from an orchestra in england and he took it .

no , you ca n't , and i think that 's the whole problem with aliens ; you just ca n't trust them . you may get some nice ones occasionally like starman or e.t. , but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard . anyway , we 're just about out of time . next week on 'world of the psychic , ' hairless pets . until then , this is peter venkman saying ... ... good night .

before you go running to the newspapers with this , would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown ?

you 're very brave , louis . good luck .

oh , sure , that sounds great .

janine , do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home ?

that 's very practical . i hate going out on new year 's eve , too .

oh migod ! i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to do that . it was an accident .

oh , johnny . did you back the wrong horse .

it must be the chemical fumes in the studio . people start imagining things --

this is the one that looked at dana .

my pleasure .

it 's a painting i 'm restoring for the new byzantine exhibition . it 's a self-portrait of prince vigo , the carpathian . he ruled most of carpathia and moldavia in the 17th century .

i , vigo , the scourge of carpathia --

command me , lord .

i , vigo , the scourge of carpathia , the sorrow of moldavia , command you .

you 've got to stop them . please !

can i have some of your water ?

sustained . mr. tully , do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case ?

then you should go to the police . i do n't believe in any of that stuff .

you were the one who got me in .

i predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on new year 's eve .

well , i think it 's important for people to know that the world is in danger .

i had my fingers crossed when they swore me in , but i 'm going to tell you the truth . there are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding , things that ca n't be explained and that most people do n't want to know about anyway . that 's where we come in .

i 'll ask you again , dr. venkman . why were you digging the hole ? and please remember that you 're under oath .

they came from ostrov in eastern poland .

i 'm worried . the vibrations could shake her to pieces . we should have padded her feet .

they love you , lib . keep it up .

this wo n't wait until tomorrow , venkman . it 's hot and it 's ready to pop .

a hundred and five years ? he really hung on , did n't he .

you were supposed to help me with this .

that 's a thousand million electron volts .

egon !

i ca n't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there 's no way back . sure , it 's crowded , it 's dirty , it 's noisy . and there are too many people who 'd just as soon step on your face as look at you . but there 've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg . we just have to mobilize it .

it wo n't work . there 's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell .

nine feet -- ten --

no , not exactly a man of the people . `` also known as vigo the cruel , vigo the torturer , vigo the despised , and vigo the unholy . ''

i 'm egon --

seems like a pretty open-minded guy , huh ?

what 's the reading ?

nothing . not a trace .

there 's something very familiar about this painting .

rivers of the stuff !

i 'd put my money on that vigo character .

there 's definitely something going on in that studio . the pke levels were max-plus and the giga-meter was showing all red .

oh , right , you told me that . they came to america seeking other kinds of cheese , as i recall . how about you , winston ?

i do n't think they make nikes in her size .

are you kidding ? we 'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th . i 'm going to take 72nd straight up to fifth . trust me , i used to drive a cab .

only one way to find out . ready , teddy ?

it 's all over the city , pete -- well , under it actually .

yeah , sorry i missed it . i guess you guys did n't know about the dress code here . it 's really kind of a coat and tie place .

okay , but you 're missing all the fun .

you 're not sleeping with this stuff , are you ?

well , we sing to it , we talk to it , we say supportive , nurturing things --

and now you 're going to eat it ?

i 'm peter --

dana ! dana barrett !

who , ray ?

ray -- ray -- how do you feel , man ?

do n't you see ? it 's the slime . that stuff is like pure , concentrated evil .

are you telling me how to drive ?

you finished here ?

you got a flux and a half .

i guess he was n't too popular at the end there .

it likes all the sappy stuff : 'cumbaya , ' 'everything is beautiful , ' 'it 's a small world ' -- but it loves jackie wilson .

yeah , but what a ride . you ca n't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow .

that 's it , ray . i 've had it . no more parties . i 'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds .

ready ?

how deep does it get ? that water 's cold and i ca n't swim .

right , and the first time someone gets mad , their toaster will eat their hand .

uuuuuuugh ! !

have i done the right thing ?

are n't you glad we waited ?

well , i guess some people have it and some do n't .

incredible ! five for five . you 're not cheating on me here , are you ?

ummm -- figure eight ?

oh , sure . i 'm getting used to this .

are you the gatekeeper ?

i got the twister game for later ...

fine , louis . we 'll stop in for a drink .

oh , dana , it 's you ...

well , i 'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you .

okay , i 'll help you . should we make some dip or something ?

i 've got to go now .

i 'll pick you up at your place . i 'll bring along the roylance guide -- we can read after we eat .

all right . since you put it that way .

what 's he doing in my refrigerator .

well , the name zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 b.c . by the ... what 's that say ?

is he dying or something ?

i do n't have to take abuse from you . i have other people dying to give it to me .

most people ca n't hear me with the whole orchestra playing . you 're good .

all right .

if it 's any comfort to you , i do n't think you 're crazy .

i told you , i ...

well , let 's check it out .

uh-huh .

that 's a violin concerto .

you play the cello ! it 's my favorite instrument .

is that your professional opinion ?

why would anyone make up a thing like that ?

we 're all professionals here , miss ...

no , we 're moving you off campus . the board of regents has decided to terminate your grant . you are to vacate these premises immediately .

that would definitely explain it .

definitely some sort of fighting spaniel , i think .

he 's a big one . you do n't want to mess with that particular breed .

that is one speedy mutt .

did you see it ? what was it ?

one thing at a time . we do n't even know what it is yet .

thank you for coming . i 'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly .

keep it anyway . i have another one at home .

i do n't believe in luck .

it 's a souvenir from the 1964 world 's fair at flushing meadow . it 's my lucky coin .

what is it ?

remind me not to go to lunch with you .

oh , that 's very - unusual .

janine , i 'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry .

i did n't ask him . all i know is that i have n't had a break in two weeks and you promised you 'd hire more help .

here 's the paper on the brooklyn job . she paid with a visa card .

yes , sir . do n't worry . we handle this kind of thing all the time .

at ease , officers . i 'm peter venkman . i think there 's been some kind of misunderstanding here and i want to cooperate in every way i can .

hey ! make yourself useful ! go save a tree !

go ahead ! get a court order . then i 'm gon na sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution .

no , you may not .

yes , it would .

in a storage facility .

and where do you put these ghosts once you catch them ?

can i help you ?

then my theory was correct .

i 'll tell you the effect ! it pisses me off !

yes . i do n't like this .

on earth -- no . but on krypton we could slice him up like oscar mayer bologna .

yeah , yeah . i just want to see 'em .

what on earth gave you that idea ?

but it 's my favorite state .

you talked to gozer ?

he wants to shut down the storage grid .

i do n't think so . it 's more of that gozer thing . she says she 's the gatekeeper . does that make any sense to you ?

does she want to be ?

i 'm with dana barrett and she 's floating three feet off the bed .

what ?

wait ! wait ! there 's something i forgot to tell you .

yeah , i can smell it .

did you see anything ?

generally , you do n't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance . what do you think , egon ?

i 'm always serious .

spengler , are you serious about actually catching a ghost ?

oh , this is big , peter . this is very big . there 's definitely something here .

look at the structure of the roof cap . it looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker nasa uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies .

i need two new purge valves . how 's the grid around the storage facility holding up ?

neutronize . system shut .

i blame myself .

great ! the marshmallows are about to get their revenge .

the stay-puft marshmallow man ! he was on all the packages we used to buy when i was a kid . we used to roast stay-puft marshmallows at camp waconda !

and you came up with that ?

well , that ought to do it .

i guess they do n't build them like they used to , huh ?

i 'm getting high readings near the air vents . it must be using the duct system to get around . see , i told you we 'd get something .

they will .

why do n't i check out the building ? it may have a history of psychic turbulence .

do you think it 's wide enough ? how much ?

hey , lady ? lady ! can you talk ? who are you ? this is not working . think of something else .

excuse me for a minute . ray , i 'm right in the middle of something here . can you come back in about an hour ?

every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world .

yeah , judgement day .

uh ... oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in dana barrett 's apartment building ... and they 're most unusual .

hey man . what is it you 're so involved with there ?

what have i got now ? it 's exactly as if there were two emperors . because of this the people have two minds . he is their champion .

not yet , dear brother ...

tell lykas to send a retiarius and a samnite to help tiger .

`` ... encased in the armor of a demigod , narcissus the good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast ... ''

if i ever loved narcissus it was n't like you want .

why not do it in the colosseum ?

commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father . except that he ca n't heave out his ghost .

it 's disgusting ! animals ! i had to come here under armed guard . slaves -- get this junk out of my sight .

i 'm sure , i do n't know .

did narcissus die today ? was n't this his day to die ?

maybe you should get married . pick one of your cousins , it would demonstrate a profound stability .

why ? then they 'll notice when i 'm gone . well . i 'm making a public appearance are n't i ?

and caesar ! let 's not forget to serve caesar !

where is my family ?

they wo n't break this one .

the dangerous man , caesar , is the man who does n't care .

that 's difficult to say , general .

so am i .

i 'm serious .

throw it down into the streets ! down into the forum . if it 's my father they want then give him to them !

ignore that ? ! the sooner we leave this disgusting place the better .

the senate is out to sink you . i swear it , caesar , your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor . your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of janus when you must be confirmed the senate will be able to deny you .

you do n't want to kill him . if anything happens to him now you will be blamed ... and he knows it . besides , that gladiator school is a fortress . it would take the army to break in there . what you want is to ... offer him the wooden sword . if he takes it , he 's no longer the champion of the people , is he ? he 's gone . and you are a hero for awarding it .

underdog ! how can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time ! i 'm the emperor why ca n't i kill him ? he could be poisoned , or somehow killed to look like an accident .

he left us at dawn .

we need more statues -- perhaps i should open medical clinics . for the poor . citizens only , though ...

jerses -- tomorrow ...

yes , caesar ?

tribuus , what happened in the arena ? was narcissus killed ?

where is my father ?

agh ! please ! he 's having a secret device constructed for the circus . the brass craftsmen are working overtime .

i do n't know ...

commodus ... he 's a gladiator ... is he mad ?

this is cos , this precocious young man . a scribe for the daily action . i 've invited him to write a small piece about you ...

i hope you live to see what i believe ...

the moment you returned from the battle your options were clear . if you are a friend to neither side , legate , you must be an enemy to both . we needed to know what you believed .

we all know what right is , senator .

would you support the senate if they would give you a trial ? you 'd have to give me your word .

when the senate and the emperor agree miracles can happen .

my loyalties ... were in doubt .

would that marcus had lived .

`` if you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic , then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men , just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads . but ... ''

yours will do !

of course i know -- who do you think is paying for it ? the emperor himself , did n't you know ? why do you think commodus came rushing up to the front ? burning patriotism ? filial love ? he wants to be sure when he takes over there 's enough cash left in the treasury to ... play emperor . watch out for him , narcissus ; he 's inexperienced , but ... be careful .

i do n't believe that . he 's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron . you know we 're preparing for a full-blown invasion of germany .

without him . he 'd be weeping if he overheard that . well ? the idea of you as my adopted brother is very ... exciting .

i thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities .

no future-telling , please , i 've been terrified enough for one day .

they fear me .

the senators admire you .

everyone talking about it ? i would n't wonder . all i seek is a genuine balance of power between the emperor and the senate . thus i have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the senators . this includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan . it 's a start , only a start . if the emperor and the senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share . this means commodus has to bend ; does he strike you as that type ?

it 's not because he 's young , it 's because he 's ignorant and arrogant . his sister is a better man . that 's why i have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the senate .

he 's like you , sir , too tough for the gods to swallow .

i 've made so many mistakes , narcissus . we all put off the very last duties of our lives because we 're afraid of admitting when our lives are over .

i want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign .

on my honor as your daddy ...

on your honor as a roman officer , daddy ?

as soon as i can .

much more colorful than the ones we wear . and , of course , less dented .

can you stop that slaughter ? ! can you free these men ?

what are you fighting for in here ? the good of rome ? i can end this madness now ! take the job for the sake of the gods , live !

you seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand ! narcissus , the republic is dead . you think those senators could govern ? for the last hundred and fifty years they 've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of imperial asses !

it 's my job to keep my job . and that , by the way , is now head of praetorian guard . good ole tribuus has been retired .

i ca n't let you do that .

rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy ? have you told your troops that ?

what deal ?

let 's hope he does n't start giving orders .

how long do you think commodus will let us live once he 's in power ? a month ? half a year ? paestum will be a prison where he 'll hold us until it 's time ...

no !

we do n't need your help we 're doing great on our own .

i 'm a soldier -- we 're at war . i ca n't stay home tending the damned olive groves ?

who else ? i 'm the one who runs the estates while you 're here risking everything we have for the glory of rome ! or for the glory of you !

very fancy . did you design the bottle ?

you need to come home !

of course ...

they 're studying with cynics .

is n't the helmet magnificent ?

he 's very realistic .

so , things change . the government has moved to the circus . you 're going to fight last . and commodus is going to fight first .

before they leave , get gold .

no . tell them i 'll do it . but i want more posters all over rome .

how much money is involved ?

so i pretend i 'm dead . you get gold , what do i get ?

what the hell are you talking about , greek ?

it will be good luck for you to wear that helmet ... it belonged to cimon of smyrna ... he was crushed by an elephant .

do n't be ridiculous .

at the end of the day i was approached by the golden pompeii olive oil company . small , but profitable . they asked if you would endorse their oil . we could get some very nice posters . make some very big money ...

then , you 'll die ... just , know this : because you asked i asked : i 'm sorry but ...

chain him .

death is ... everything for me . now you have to go to your cell , and i to dicker with jerses ... you 'll be fed well . i want you to be fit as you can be ; i want you to win for me tomorrow ! i want all my gladiators to win and be happy ! besides , i 've never owned a roman general before .

condemned ? are n't i owed a trial before being condemned ?

you 're a legate in the roman army . huh ... ? and you act like one . what was your crime ?

where did he do it ?

oh no . he said that .

no , benjamin .

why would n't it ?

benjamin -- i have n't even said i 'll marry you yet .

we could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow .

yes .

you really will ?

i do n't see how we can .

but you might .

will you kiss me !

what are you going to do now ?

no . i have two . the other one is the one i 'm looking for . what 's this ? it 's from my grandmother .

do n't you have it on ?

my belt .

if you want .

can i just sit here while you 're packing ?

all right -- but listen to me . what happened was there was this party at my parents . i drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --

because it is n't true .

why ?

what ?

how could you do that , benjamin ?

i said i think it is .

i think it is .

no . i want to know why you 're here in berkeley ?

-- really incredible --

yes .

do n't cry .

elaine --

what ?

what is it ?

why are n't you ready ?

benjamin -- what 's happening ?

because i would n't want you to do it unless you really wanted to !

you sure you really want to ?

yes . she had a husband and a son .

nothing . i 'm just wondering if they have a bar or not . i mean let 's go see . let 's go see if they do or not .

is n't there one in the taft hotel ?

i 've had this feeling -- ever since i 've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that i have to be rude all the time . do you know what i mean ?

listen -- could you stop crying , please ?

this whole idea -- this date and everything . it was my parents ' idea . they forced me into it .

what ?

i want to go home .

i just want to tell you something .

i do n't know .

no .

you 're living at home now . is that right ?

i certainly hope you --

oh . well -- i 'm not sure -- but you might try the first presbyterian . that 's on allan street .

okay . enough said . that 's a deal .

yes , i will .

excuse me . mr. mcquire .

look -- she 's all right . she 's upset and she screamed . but she 's okay now .

screaming is n't all right . not in my house it is n't .

i hate that . i wo n't stand for it .

ahhh .

well -- i 'm just sort of traveling through .

not exactly .

you a student ?

give me an hour .

where are you ?

look -- i was thinking about that time after the party --

mrs. robinson -- i do n't quite know how to put this --

for god 's sake , benjamin , will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse ?

benjamin -- i am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion . now if you wo n't do me a simple favor i do n't know what .

mrs. robinson ?

benjamin ?

oh . well actually , i 'd just as soon find it myself . i just have the toothbrush to carry up and i think i can manage it myself .

where is it ?

do you have any luggage , mister -- gladstone ?

will you sign the register , please ?

a single . just for myself , please .

can i help you , sir !

how ?

listen to me very carefully , benjamin . you are not to see elaine again . ever . those are my orders . is that clear ?

mrs. robinson -- i have a date with elaine . we 're going for a drive .

well i would n't . i would never say it if it was n't true .

but it 's not .

if that 's how you feel --

benjamin , i want to apologize to you if that 's the impression you got .

you 're goddamn right i am .

you go to hell . you go straight to hell , mrs. robinson . do you think i 'm proud of myself ? do you think i 'm proud of this ?

i 'm not good enough for her to associate with , am i ? i 'm not good enough to even talk about her , am i ?

do you understand that ?

well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden ?

why not ?

do n't talk about elaine .

that 's enough .

a ford ! a ford ! goddamnit , a ford ! that 's great !

what kind of car was it ?

i do n't think we were the first .

oh no . in the car you did it ?

art ?

at college .

was he a law student at the time ?

not particularly .

i mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances ?

oh no . you had to marry him because you got pregnant ?

i do n't .

well how do you feel about him , then ?

we 've talked enough , benjamin .

is it ?

oh no . are you kidding me ?

so you do n't -- i mean i do n't like to seem like i 'm prying but i guess you do n't sleep together or anything .

we do n't .

please . now tell me . how do you know he wo n't wake up sometime and follow you .

he 's asleep .

i mean everything . i do n't know anything about how you -- how you work this . i do n't know how you get out of the house at night . i do n't know the risk involved .

i do n't remember .

i got up .

yes i do .

no . think of another topic . tell me what you did today .

are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art .

do n't you ?

you start it off . i do n't know anything about it .

oh my god .

i 'm not . no . but do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then ?

are you tired of it ?

all we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together .

good . i mean are we dead or something ?

are you afraid of me ?

oh -- yes . wood ?

well .

you 're welcome . well -- i 'll see you later , mrs. robinson .

thank you .

the number .

why do n't you get it .

you ? oh no . no . i 'll get it .

do you want me to get it ?

i have n't . no .

what ?

nervous . well , i am a bit nervous . i mean it 's -- it 's pretty hard to be suave when you 're --

of course .

thank you for taking me home .

yes .

i 've got to go .

yes , i do .

do you understand what i said ?

if you wo n't sleep with me this time , benjamin , i want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we 'll make some kind of arrangement .

jesus christ !

get away from that door .

do n't be nervous .

i really do n't want to put this on again . wo n't you bring it up ?

because i am confused about things . i ca n't tell what i 'm imagining . i ca n't tell what 's real . i ca n't --

i know that . but please , mrs. robinson . this is difficult for me .

do n't you think he trusts us together ?

well , it would look pretty funny , would n't it ?

because you 're going to bed . i do n't think i should be up here .

right .

thank you .

if you still think i 'm trying to seduce you --

i 'd rather not , mrs. robinson .

oh . well , goodnight .

very much .

we had it done last christmas . would you like to see it ?

we 'll forget it right now . finish your drink .

why no . i had n't thought of it . i feel rather flattered that you --

so ?

oh no , mrs. robinson , oh no .

my husband will be back quite late .

sit down , benjamin .

look -- i think i should be going --

did you know that ?

what ?

well -- i 've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person .

you 've known me nearly all of your life . you must have formed some opinion .

well , why ca n't you just lock the doors and go to bed ?

what do you drink ?

you do n't ?

what ?

oh -- i forgot . the track star does n't smoke .

it 's down the hall .

sir ?

hey -- i do n't get it .

i 'm not with your party -- i 'm sorry .

no -- actually i 'm just looking for a friend .

i 'll find your table in a moment . braddock . not braniff ? we have a braniff .

they do n't know ?

i 'm going up to berkeley today .

-- then i 'll simply invite all the robinsons ' over for dinner on thursday .

no wait . wait .

why did you say that ?

i drive around .

well i 'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night .

sure .

how do you know ? you have n't seen her since high school . i guess your evenings , whatever you do with them , are just too valuable .

different .

what about it ?

do n't shout at me , ben .

shaking hands . well , that 's not saying much for my wife , is it ?

why ?

well , i do n't think we have a whole lot to say to each other , ben . i do think you should know the consequences of what you 've done . i do think you should know that my wife and i are getting a divorce soon .

you do n't respect me terribly much either , do you ?

no , it 's not --

do you have a special grudge against me ? do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me ?

mr. robinson ?

that 's what i 'd do if i could . nothing wrong with that . hey ben , elaine 's coming down from berkeley soon . i want you to call her up this time .

great .

you have yourself a few flings this summer . i bet you 're quite a ladies ' man .

ben -- i think -- i think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to .

thank you .

in many ways i feel as though you were my own son .

what ?

can you see me now ?

benjamin -- where are you ?

it 's benjamin .

yes ?

-- before he does -- you 're disappointing them , ben . you 're disappointing them .

this boy -- i 'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a frank halpingham award scholar -- but before he does --

i do n't believe it .

the carlsons ' are here .

what about the money ?

with the pearls --

with the pearls ?

poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache ... i know -- i had it in the war . besides , she 's very pretty -- not young but --

why ?

no -- no -- no -- no ...

how ?

and what are you going to do ?

i 've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth .

oh !

anything for you .

yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday .

money .

really ?

where downstairs ?

shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs ?

free --

are n't you ?

dictation . you know ...

you ?

he must be very nice .

like dancing ?

i 'm worried about you .

they 've brought me such good luck -- you --

why ?

no ?

are you coming to the theatre ? oh -- i shall dance tonight -- how i shall dance -- i want to feel that you are in the theatre .

oh -- yes but -- later .

for vienna ?

you do believe that i really love you ?

do you understand ?

i wanted money desperately -- can you understand ? -- that 's why i wanted the pearls . i was threatened -- i was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money . i 've been following you -- i 've admired you . but i have forced myself not to think about you -- last night , at last , i managed to came into your room and -- and now .

i do n't want them now .

you may keep the pearls -- i do n't want them any more -- i 'll make you a present of them .

and ?

no .

why do you smile ?

and -- and --

no irony . you 're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired . i feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever .

why do you look at me like that ?

i 'd like to smoke a cigarette .

so you feel like coming into a lady 's room -- and you come ... what now ?

do n't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that .

poor little grusinskaya ! does it do you good to cry ? are you afraid ? shall i go ?

nothing -- only to be here .

oh , no , stay here , baron -- stay .

you 're all right now -- it 's very late -- goodnight , kringelein .

no -- no please -- oh , do n't go -- do n't go -- do n't leave me alone , baron .

here -- here it is . here 's your pocketbook , kringelein .

all of that at once , baron ?

pardon me , baron . permit me again ...

ready , kringelein ?

gambling ! i 'd like that . i have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me .

perhaps this evening , baron , we could go to the casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights ?

the baron is tired ?

a little strange , baron .

hello , mr. kringelein . how do you feel now ?

do i know him -- i know him through and through .

permit me -- my name is kringelein -- from fredersdorf .

thank you , sir .

i thought she was splendid !

look here , sir -- i 'm completely at your mercy -- i 'm desperate -- it 's a matter of life or death -- i had to get some money -- tonight .

as you will .

i did not ask your advice .

most imposters are --

i do n't believe it -- he was a real gentleman . i know people ... i 'm so tired i can hardly see out of my eyes . no sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work . but it 's too bad about the baron , you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow .

if a young woman , a stenographer , -- etc .

for me ?

anyone asked for me ?

any letters ?

no -- i must find it -- fourteen thousand two hundred marks .

there is no pocketbook here ... on the floor probably .

i was sent as a military surgeon to south africa . stinking climate . taken prisoner . home on parole not to fight . i was a surgeon in the great war till the end . grenade in the face . carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. isolated two years . i 've been everything .

everything ?

a masculine paradise -- drink , the ladies , dancing ...

what , doctor ?

for me ? -- oh , please , something sweet and cold .

barman -- whiskey -- for you , mr. kringelein ?

yes , thanks to the baron . the best shops , the very best . look , doctor , silk -- feels so nice on the skin ... a london hat , see -- made in england , that 's silk , too -- fifty marks ... look , the price is on it . that was half my salary before . the baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the baron .

i have nothing better to do , mr. kringelein .

yes -- yes -- i am tired . i have been ill ...

you 're tired . i can see that .

this gentleman can have my room .

you 'll have a good time with me . want to ? i 've got enough money . ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook . three thousand four hundred that i won . it will last a long time . i can win more -- we 'll travel .

yes , of course , -- money !

i did n't like preysing right off .

quick -- something awful -- awful has happened . go -- go at once , -- mr. preysing --

i do n't know -- i 'd like to do anything --

oh , thank you , miss flaemm . oh , please , miss flaemm -- permit me , miss flaemm , wo n't you have something sweet -- a louisiana flip . a louisiana flip .

oh , can anyone engage you for the evening ?

you think so ?

you are late . i 've been waiting for you -- waiting .

can you pay some attention to me ?

a thousand marks --

of course -- of course .

well ?

i must go to england -- at once .

well ?

sit here . cognac -- for you ?

do you gentlemen know each other , mr. kringelein -- mr. preysing -- baron von gaigern .

presently , mr. preysing .

oh -- too bad . did you quarrel ?

ca n't you understand me ?

do n't misunderstand me . i 'm a married man -- with grownup daughters . uh --

that 's from skiing .

you ...

i got ten marks for that .

moreover ...

then you will please wait outside .

yes , mr. preysing -- that 's what we want to know .

shhh -- here he is now .

if the preysing people get the manchester contract , we shall certainly merge with the preysing company -- but if they have n't they 're ruined -- preysing will have to declare himself .

next week .

under these circumstances it 's quite a different matter .

oh no -- no -- the session is over . let 's go , it 's off . thank you , gentlemen .

what ?

you 've decided against the merger ?

evil days -- i 've shown you here -- -- my company exports to the balkans alone , sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year .

and i said we did n't .

of course you took the initiative .

we did not approach you .

now to proceed with the projected merger , the advantages for the saxonia are so obvious ...

since , on the eleventh of june , this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages .

i mean with the manchester people ?

we have a good many connections in england , naturally .

there 's a lot of business to be done with the manchester cotton company . they 've the whole english market right in their hands . have you any connections with -- manchester ?

mr. preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties ...

ah , come on -- we 're going home .

yes , madam . and now madam will sleep . it is not long 'till the train .

madam should sleep .

five minutes , suzette , come back in five minutes . i 'll ring .

send it away -- i sha n't need it .

let us cancel the engagement .

i know -- i know -- but it will be sunny in tremezzo . we 'll have a guest then .

i suppose i can cancel the vienna engagement .

such nonsense .

you have n't time .

suzette -- i told you not to bring the pearls . i will not wear them tonight .

good morning , pimenov .

what -- what is it ? last night ...

it is time for the performance .

will mr. kringelein kindly register .

does that mean that the bath is my own ? -- - private ?

do n't worry about me , mr. general director pryesing -- worry about yourself . there has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four .

we must call the police , your excellency .

yes , i know them --

yes , the police must be called .

yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you 're discharged .

who are you ? -- an embezzler most likely .

go away -- go away .

some champagne , miss flaemm ?

you say that you are employed by us in fredersdorf , and here you are in berlin , indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- quite extraordinary , mr. kringelein , i think we will look into your books .

no , i wo n't wait -- i ca n't -- every day is precious -- every hour -- every minute .

i wo n't wait -- i ca n't wait -- i waited three days before i got a room at all and what a room that is .

if you will wait one moment , sir .

madam grusinskaya 's car .

four minutes past . please come .

when she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she 'll be all right . i know these people .

terrible . after this , no more ballets for me . jazz -- just jazz .

let 's go down and find her -- i need a drink -- come along zinnowitz . i do n't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years .

pretty as a picture .

zinnowitz , would you say she was pretty ?

what do you want with her ?

i can understand that -- after your -- uh --

yes -- that 's what i want -- i 'd like to tear loose -- i 'd like a drink . i 'd like to go down to that dancing place . i 'd like to start something .

what you need is some relaxation .

no one would have thought it of me . i 've been getting rusty in fredersdorf . well , if bluff is what the world wants i guess i can put up as big a bluff as anyone . from now on ...

that .

bluff -- bluff -- all bluff .

you let me talk till i 'm hoarse and you had manchester sewed-up all the time . why ?

good night .

i will . so long , bobo .

you know , i like that suit , bobo . i do n't know what there is about it , but it somehow makes you look taller .

oh , well , you know . i just clip a buck here and a buck there . not enough to notice .

permanent damage .

you hit a person with the oranges in the towel , they get big , awful looking bruises , but they do n't really get hurt , not if you do it right . it 's for working scams against insurance companies .

i got a lot of people work for me , lilly . i ca n't have shit like this .

motherhood .

your what ?

one question . do you want to stick to that story , or do you want to keep your teeth ?

i 'm not getting away with anything , bobo .

you work for me , huh ? then i just may flush you down the toilet . drive me to the durando .

hi , bobo .

i 'll put you in one thirty-one . very quiet . faces the desert .

hah .

roy ? he 's always crying .

cole , it 'll be all right . honey ?

oh , i know , i know , and you 've been wonderful since i was widowed . but mister hebbing has -- -- you do n't mind my telling him , darling -- -- suffered reverses . if he could ...

mary beth ! this has never been anything but --

henry , next time , could n't mister hebbing --

well , i 'll have to take your word for it , mary beth . here 's your money .

well , of course not ! i know how dangerous this is . but i would trust mister hebbing with anything . would n't i , darling ?

these machines -- they 're in here .

seven seconds . i do n't see how you do it .

well , you 've got your information ahead of new york , i see that .

one of those computer geniuses , is n't it ?

his blood pressure is under a hundred . i do n't think he 'll live to get to the hospital .

well , i 'd have to see it , of course .

why , of course it is . i can offer you -- well , five hundred dollars .

i ca n't understand a thing like this . it 's something you almost never see .

why ? what 's wrong ?

you 're turning me down ? makes no sense , roy .

perk .

but you need a man right now . it would n't be fair to you to --

i do n't know offhand what your best year 's been , we can look it up . the idea is , we 'll top it by fifteen percent .

lilly , jesus , what are you doing ?

that money would n't last forever . and then what ? you 'd be back in some other part of the rackets . another bobo justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands . this way , you 've got to go the square route . you could send me a card when you 're settled , i could maybe help out sometimes ...

and that 's why you 've got to get rid of this money . if you keep it around , it 'll just make you think how clever you are . it 'll be a temptation to get back into the game .

well , it does n't matter , does it ? i 'm getting out .

sure , sure , that does n't count . that 's different .

i do n't see why not .

never .

oh , really ? you 've got a legitimate complaint , roy , i do n't deny that . i was n't a very good mother when you were a kid .

oh ? i did n't know anything was .

you do n't know what i 'd do , roy . you have no idea . to live .

yeah , sure , that sounds nice .

i thought you 'd be happy for me . after all , you --

i thought it over , and you were right . you wanted me out of the rackets , and now --

well , you 're gon na start , if you hope to live through this . a square job and a quiet life . you start showing up at the track or the hot spots and bobo 's boys will be all over you .

just a few bucks .

it is , is n't it ? and maybe it 's a break for me after all . i 've been wanting out of the racket for years , and now i 'm out . i can make a clean start , and --

as though you do what i say .

no , you would n't . that 's what she was after , though . but why hit on me ?

myra followed you , huh ?

even so . you still got time . relax a minute , tell me what happened . sit down .

looks very solid , lilly . sit down . take a minute , tell me about it .

well , sure , roy . you want me to drive up -- ? okay , fine , come on down . it wo n't be a home-cooked meal , you know .

i thought ... i was hoping we could play it straight with one another .

no can do . have to dip in and out of my bag too much . besides , it 'll heal in the air .

you ought to put a bandage on that .

we wo n't hit the track . the beach . couple a nice restaurants .

that 's right .

why ?

i tripped over a chair .

bluebell came in ?

that was my choice , nothing to do with you . i took a chance , and it did n't work out .

sure .

my boss is a guy named bobo justus , back in baltimore . when a long shot gets too much action , i have to put money on that horse at the track , because it 's the only way to get the odds down .

not as tough as you , huh ?

what are you talking about ? so i 've got a job . so what ?

i can take care of my own bills , lilly .

just a little accident . i went by your place , picked up your mall . just bills , i 'll take care of them .

do n't mention it .

nice to see you . what am i doing in here ?

they twisted my arm .

joe , could we talk it over ? do you want a drink ?

in your other hand .

i am in school .

scram . go home .

you taught me a lot . then i invented .

what 's that ?

bullshit !

mostly , because you scare the shit out of me . i 've seen people like you before , baby . double-tough and sharp as they come , and you get what you want or else . but you do n't make it work forever .

for christ 's sake , why not ?

what i say is , no . we do n't do partners .

what ?

that 's what i say .

do n't i get any say in this ?

i called a fellow i know in tulsa , the one who plays my chauffeur . there 's a sucker there he says is made for us . and a boroker that just shut down , we can use their office , not change a thing ! now , i can scrape up ten grand without much trouble . that leaves fifteen or twenty for your end . we could start this weekend , get the sucker into position --

you and me , roy . what a team we 'll make . we think alike ; we get along together . once or twice a year we take some slob , the rest of the time we live like this . you wo n't regret this , roy .

i 'm not trying to make trouble , roy . it 's just , she 's always so nasty to me , i thought , who is she to be so high and mighty . i saw her out there , and i called a friend of mine in baltimore , so now i know who she is .

you were gone for a while .

oh , come here .

yeah ?

you do n't mind , really , do you , roy ? it 's been such a wonderful evening , i guess i just wore myself out .

i still do n't see why we have to have separate rooms . you expect your father to come through ?

think about it . okay ?

not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks . but how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand ?

and a month later , the sucker calls the cops and you 're on the run .

and when he got serious ?

it was beautiful . and getting better all the time .

i 've heard the name .

the long end . big con .

you 're on the grift . same as me .

i 'm a salesman .

the tap . what you do for a living .

oh , come on , roy .

working the what ?

you already went back to work .

big spender .

you 're a mama 's boy , if you want the truth .

oh , do n't be stupid .

and you never defend me . you 're afraid of her .

i 'll pay lilly back , do n't you worry about that .

mama !

i do n't see why you 're still here . you look healthy to me .

ow ! hey , what are you trying to do , throw me off my game ?

look at me .

let 's find out .

taking you for granite ?

oh , yeah . that 's that .

i 'm sorry , that 's an unfortunate phrase , it slipped out , i 'm , to tell you the truth , mr. dillon , this is n't an everyday occurrence around here .

well , mostly , i do n't believe it .

lieutenant pierson , phoenix police . i have a car here .

well , i 'm back now . i just wanted you to know . got ta rush .

carter .

only the real stiffs .

the cemetery ...

a dead body ?

would somebody shut this guy up ?

totally . i checked all the rooms and closets ...

you sure ?

hey , mis whittington , what 's up ?

yeah , me too , keri .

where 's molly ? she 's not in her room ...

no .

yes .

you some kind of fugitive or something ?

will , sit down ...

i thought you 'd never ask .

no .

i 'm sixteen , keri . i should be able to live wherever i want .

i guess . it 's just hard to believe .

you saw that michael meyers display . you 've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that .

then i 'll get caught .

why not ?

where 'd you get it ?

linda ! he killed linda !

molly , of all the people ... if i ca n't trust my resident assistant , then what ?

not a real fan of halloween humor , will .

no , will , this is n't the alcohol talking . it 's the truth .

my name has n't always been keri tate . it was once laurie strode .

a box of fortune cookies ... i 'm running out of advice .

i 'm going into town ... run a few errands before dark . need anything ?

the tighter you squeeze , the harder he 'll try to break free .

he 's been living out of moving boxes for three months .

you okay ? you seem a little off .

are n't they doing a terrific job this year ?

ca n't you hold it ?

let the party begin .

blaaaaaggghhhhh !

he 's in the bathroom .

we were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --

guess so ...

guess they -- went to the fair after all .

we can light our own tree at home .

is n't he that psycho who 's been spying on my sister ?

happy fuckin ' halloween .

mom , i want to go to the fair ...

like what ?

the kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here .

the voice man ! he 's here !

shh . mommy 's here . what is it ?

relax , john . they were just kids .

mrs. strode , michael myers is here to kill his family . and he wo n't stop until you are all destroyed . i only thank god that i found you before he did .

it 's ... michael ... michael myers !

come on , sweetheart -- what is this ? who 's coming ?

no -- please listen ! they 're coming ... coming for me and my baby .

danny ! danny , where are you ? !

runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in northern europe thousands of years ago . they were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood . of all the runes , thorn had the most negative influence . cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic .

not just kyle . all of you . his entire family . here . look at this .

amazing , is n't it ? i even taught him to drive .

you 've created a monster .

jamie 's baby ...

no one 's home . checked it out myself .

it 's a sign . he 's come home .

what is that ?

that 's what someone wants us to believe , but i tell you michael is alive . i feel him . i sense the evil that lives inside , just as i did all those years as i watched him . sitting behind these very same walls . staring . growing stronger . as my colleague , as my friend , please . i ca n't go through this again . not alone . i need your help to stop him .

retiring .

as always , your keen powers of perception astound me . and you 're right . i 've come to celebrate . after thirty-two years as psychiatric administrator , guess who has been named smith 's groves new chief of staff .

that 's the whole idea of living in the country . i thrive on the seclusion .

no ! ! !

please -- just tell me the truth . has michael myers come home ?

yes ... tommy . what are you doing here ?

i 'm sorry , but do i know you --

yeah , jesus -- but wars would be a lot better , i think , if guys would say to themselves sometimes , `` jesus -- i 'm not going to do that to the enemy . that 's too much . '' you could have been the manufacturer of that violin there , even though you do n't know how to make a violin , just by not busting it up . i could have been the father of all those people in nagasaki , and the mother , too , just by not dropping the bomb . i sent 'em to heaven instead -- and i do n't think there is one .

everybody thinks that .

i did n't like that violin thing . that was sad .

shut up , you ninny ! you were never to come here again -- for any reason whatsoever !

she was always a rotten wife ! she was against everything manly you ever wanted to do . he was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time , and his wife made him quit . she made him become a life insurance salesman instead .

go to the funeral ?

you 'd get this funny look in your eyes , and i 'd say to myself , `` oh , jesus -- he 's going to tell me what a retiarius is again . ''

i guess . you 're lucky you do n't have any old people around here .

first nagasaki -- now this .

i 'm lonesome already .

i 'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow , and i will not welcome your horning back into mine . a chapter has ended . we are old comrades -- at a parting of the ways .

months ?

you know what gets me ? those guys who went to the moon ! to the moon , boy !

i know , i know . i dunno . at least she 's in the same house . sure was spooky , looking in the window there , and there she was .

thank god we found the fucking diamonds !

you 're lucky , boy . my house is gon na be filled with people .

the time we were in a tree for fourteen days , you certainly tried to tell me everything about mrs. wheeler .

at least we found the diamonds .

um .

it appears that we 're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here , colonel . why do n't you run on home while the evening 's young .

one thing , anyway -- at least penelope did n't throw out all your crap . i bet alice threw out all my crap after i 'd been gone a week .

i wonder who 'll recognize us first ? they 'll wet their pants .

hm ?

thank god !

you -- you are n't going to have any friends left , if you do n't watch out .

it would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us .

gee whiz --

what went wrong ?

we got to get another pilot .

you 're making a joke .

it 's possible , of course , that you 'll die in africa .

what an awful sound !

you actually sold insurance !

for seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged -- or we would have been home long before now , believe me . we were saved from starvation by the lupi-loopo indians , who fed us a strange blue soup .

eight years you guys were together -- through thick and thin .

is penelope in ?

how are you , honeybunch ?

yeah . but it 's going to get loud again .

i do n't want to fight you .

pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber -- where it belongs .

that 's a cartridge , if i 'm not mistaken . gunpowder , bullet , cartridge case , and fulminate of mercury percussion cap -- all set to go . paul i was cleaning it .

no .

you 're free to go to her , if you want . if you 'd rather be a woman and run with the women , just say the word .

what kind of exercise ?

a hundred dollars for breakfast ?

dad 's got jungle fever , mom . what 'll i do ? mom !

scat !

penelope !

tomorrow 's saturday . anyway , she 's dead .

why do n't you go to bed -- son .

she 's a real heavy sleeper sometimes .

is looseleaf harper alive ?

i 'd like to use the sanitary facilities , if i may .

no , no , no , no , no .

dr. woodly says he 's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football . he says that when there 's a war , everybody goes but football players .

i wanted to go out for football , but mom was afraid i 'd get hurt .

the story gets hairier . should i stop ?

i do n't know .

tell me that ! tell me that !

ask about the time he and i were parachuted into yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band -- in the war against the nazis .

oh hell .

`` dad ? '' dad . the boy wants tales of derring-do . name a country .

nothing . he plays a violin in a doctors ' quartet .

he insults him all the time .

what a pity ! educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine swiss watch . everything stops . and the doctor ? he worships your father , too ?

man and boy .

i 'll see .

she went to the fight with herb shuttle , i guess .

you do n't know where your mother is ? does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night ?

the doctor was called away on an emergency . i think it was birth .

dr. woodly . i should make a little list .

do you know who wanda june is ?

hello .

she 's right , norbert -- go home . woodly i have n't said all i have to say .

there has to be a threat of some sort , nobility of some sort , glamour of some sort , sport of some sort . these elements are lacking .

no , we wo n't . no matter how it begins , it will end in death . because it always does . is n't that always how it ends , harold -- in death ?

no .

it 's still just death , the absence of life -- no honor at all . it 's worse than the blue soup by far -- that nothingness . to you , though , it 's the honor that crowns them all .

honor , i suppose .

you 're begging him to kill you ?

like what ?

last i heard , his mother was going alone .

you took him to the funeral , i hear .

i came for paul as well .

i do n't think so .

his most cherished possession ? his violin , i guess .

yes .

you learned this in some college course ?

go on .

tell me about its sexual roots .

i 'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish -- along with yours .

this is not a coy deception . i do not want to be scrogged . i want love . i want tenderness .

let me guess -- breakfast is served ?

i should have torn that door off its hinges . should have scrogged her ears off . should have broken the bed . what do you want ? well ?

cook , by god ! cook ! you 're the nigger now .

you 're a woman , are n't you ?

she 's up in heaven now . she did n't hear . she is experiencing nothing but pure happiness . there 's nothing nicer than that . chow ! harold ryan wants chow !

i have some change !

honeymoon ! honeymoon ! say it : honeymoon !

i had a trip . we 'll honeymoon here . go out and play .

do say hello to your mother .

i 'm so glad you like each other . i was so scared , so scared .

you know what i want ? i want you both to be friends . i know you both , respect you both . you should be friends .

he 's a very decent man , harold .

your old beau ?

you feel that you 're behaving as a woman should ?

seemed the most honest way to begin life together again -- natural , unrehearsed .

destiny often seems that way . you 're going to marry me .

i 'll put it in paul 's room , where it belongs .

new lives begin !

no . no .

i 've enjoyed being man .

man , as man was meant to be -- a vengeful ape who murders . he will soon be extinct . it 's time , it 's time .

if you want to be found that way .

like the saber-toothed tiger .

new dignity can be yours -- as a merciful man . you can change !

i 'm utterly satisfied .

here . finish the job .

was i ever of use ?

something seems to have happened to my self-respect .

my violin is avenged !

you are n't going to hurt me . you are n't going to hurt anybody any more . any violent gesture will seem ridiculous -- to yourself !

you have a very good mind , or i would n't have come back . that mind is now asking itself , cleverly and fairly , `` is harold ryan really a clown ? '' and the answer is , `` yes . ''

i 've struck my blow .

cut me open . find out .

evolution has made you a clown -- with a cigar . simple butchers like you are obsolete !

i love you ! have a cigar !

comical ?

you 're old -- so old .

oooooo . that hurt .

we 'll find out now , wo n't we ?

what an hallucination ! oh , dear , dear , dear , dear . oh dearie me .

yes .

the same hairy , humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon . `` honor , `` if you like .

it 's healer to killer . is that the same thing ?

it died for your sins .

you were wrong , you quack !

pacqualinincheewa root . means `` cougar fang . '' cures anything but a yellow streak down the back .

would you say that again ?

you 've been bitten by bats ?

i know malaria . malaria is n't caused by the bites of bats .

what a brilliant diagnosis !

whose son this is , whose wife that is . a fianc is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time . good night .

none .

what next ? you leave promptly , of course . there is no question as to whose home this is --

i feel the same way . what next ?

you wish the woman good luck , and you tell the man how fortunate he is . that 's how it goes .

neighbor ! doctor ! i live across the hall .

yes ! yes ! the boy ! one boy !

and still mrs. harold ryan ?

dead ! such a final word . dead ! did you hear that ?

can i -- uh -- help you gentlemen ?

ooops .

well -- i walked up to the front door . i was still alive . big surprise . i rang the doorbell , and old mrs. wheeler answered . she had her goddamn knitting . i said , `` guess who ? '' she conked right out .

who 's dead ?

jesus .

she married an accountant named stanley kestenbaum .

you did n't even find that out ?

thought you were another wife , maybe .

no .

i 'll kill myself .

you bet i 'll worry about it . i said something wrong ?

he can hardly talk .

what does he say to do ?

dr. woodly ? you know who this is ?

it is you , is n't it , harold ?

for heaven 's sakes !

is norbert still here ?

i hate that thing .

you 're the only woman he ever took out .

oh , paul --

stay home tonight !

i know .

maybe he 'll come back tonight ! it 's his birthday .

and this is my son , paul . he was only four years old when his father disappeared .

no !

do n't worry about it .

we do n't have a maid any more .

you 're taking mom out tonight ?

it 's true .

thank you , herb . you 're a wonderful man . you really are . everybody respects you for what you 've done for scouting and the little league .

what 's the matter now ?

did you talk to paul ?

how nice .

it 's dark in there . penelope and that 's where he is !

he ditched me . he started running , and i started running , then he lost me in the park .

far as i know .

if you 'll pardon the expression , that 's when you 'll see the fur and feathers fly . good night .

when harold is definitely out of the picture , penelope , when i do n't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or paul wrong . i 'm going to ask you to be my wife .

this conversation took place , incidentally , about three months before harold was declared legally dead .

if you want to wrestle , you got lehigh . if you want to play tennis , you go to vanderbilt .

all through the day i 'm so confident . that 's why i 'm such a good salesman , you know ? i have confidence , and i look like i have confidence , and that gives other people confidence . people laugh sometimes when they find out i 'm a vacuum cleaner salesman . they stop laughing , though , when they find out i made forty-three thousand dollars last year . i 've got six other salesmen working under me , and what they all plug into is my confidence . that 's what charges them up .

goodbye .

do it !

no . but he 's going to be . if he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side , i can say to him , `` you and i are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight . '' on that we can build .

we 've got to rescue him .

to show myself how brave i am . the issue 's in doubt , you know -- since i 'm always for peace --

why would you do that ?

no ! oh no ! three people murdered in there in the last six weeks ! the police wo n't even go in there any more .

after this explosion , i think , he 'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again .

this is very good for us .

i never knew when to hold it -- or who to ask , or what to say .

they made her so sleepy she could n't work .

would you like to say something about killing , colonel ?

if he 'd just get into scouting , and camp out some , and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire --

kid -- kid --

maybe god has let everybody who ever lived be reborn -- so he or she can see how it ends . even pithecanthropus erectus and australopithecus and sinanthropus pekensis and the neanderthalers are back on earth -- to see how it ends . they 're all on times square -- making change for peepshows . or recruiting marines .

none of my relatives are chinese communists . speak for yourself .

which we do . but we can stop doing that .

phooey .

you 've got to fight from time to time .

walt disney , who gave us snow white and the seven dwarfs , plays shuffleboard . jesus christ plays shuffleboard .

yes , we do .

that you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room .

you mean i 'm black ?

look , i do n't know anybody . i never seen her before .

... about this woman . i 'm trying to find her . do you know her ?

i said i just wanted to talk to you ...

what do you mean ?

i have to ask you that . if you were vice you could n't deny it . you ought to dress less square . you would n't get hassled so much . here , let me help you get that tie off .

you 're still dressed ?

okay . i 'll take a half hour .

do you want to take a session ?

'film producer seeks young men , 18 to 25 , for hardcore film . prior film experience a must . call jake at players motel . 777 vine . 463-5671 .

'film producer ' -- that should be in caps , bold face .

that 's charity . she 's out back . she 'll be free in half hour .

i 'm looking for tod . is he in ?

yeah , yeah ...

yeah . how did you know ?

yes . i think it 'll look better .

yeah . he 's a nice guy . do n't lose him . maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit . it 's a little ...

yeah , overpowering . that was the word i was looking for .

i tried to get more , but this is the limit . the de vries line has the same area .

where is he , niki ?

look , niki , this really is n't my business . i do n't know anything about ...

just a guess . did you have it good with your wife ? you know , sex .

you wife is n't dead is she ?

i would n't expect too much . i mean about her coming back . once a girl gets into the life .

grand rapids ? of course .

fuck .

yeah , yeah , go on .

do they believe in reincarnation ? i believe in reincarnation .

christian reformed . it 's a dutch calvinist denomination .

he deals in pain .

why ? are you a sex fiend ?

say what ?

you wo n't keep growing at this rate .

you really should n't eat like that . all that sugar . it 's not good for you .

and your wife ? where 's she ?

her name is kristen . she disappeared a couple of months ago .

i did n't think so . i 've fucked detectives . who are you ?

you 're not a private detective either , are you ?

this is different . this is nine hundred dollars .

half now , half later .

up front ?

are you a private detective ?

how much do you make a week , niki ?

where 's he ?

you know her ?

um-hm . live sound .

do i know you ? were n't you on the set the other night ? with ramada .

it 's your money . you talk .

too bad . i was n't in it .

i work with ramada . we 're doing some pictures together .

the other girl is the star ?

does she know anything about this ?

get out !

get out . get out of here , goddammit .

i ai n't cheated you , pilgrim . this is research , damn it ! that girl could have told us something .

what 's it called ?

i do n't know .

where did you get that film ?

hmm .

they 're legal now .

that 's like a stag film .

i 've got some news . your daughter 's all right . at least i think she is .

this used to be a real city . i was here about fifteen years ago . embezzlement case . it was always a little religious for my taste , but at least it was a city . with a downtown and all .

can you meet me in about an hour ? at the pantlind hotel ?

hello ?

you are .

let me ask you a personal question , a painful one . the first of many . tell me , was your daughter the kind of girl to run around , to , ah , play practical jokes , maybe ?

... what do you have to offer ?

those cops , like all cops , are intelligent enough , but they are masters of de-ductive reason . that is , you ask them what three and two are they 'll tell you five , but if you ask them what five is , they go blank . that 's spec-u-lative reasoning , and that 's where i come in .

tell them anything you want . tell them i 'm on a vacation , a business trip . tell them i needed a rest . tell them anything , just do n't tell them ...

what plan ?

i think i 've found a way to find kristen . i have a plan . but i have to be alone .

what is going on ?

just do what i say . do n't ask .

is marsha there ?

what happened ?

anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner sunday . with kristen gone you 'll be all alone .

where !

she 's got a man . a white guy . tod something or other .

hey man .

okay .

is this with a girl named kristen ?

i was told that there were certain things that only ratan could provide .

yeah .

that 's all right .

i 'm just trying to find ... who owns this store ?

that girl ? no , never saw her . i do n't know anybody .

i do n't know what you 're talking about .

this is from the movie i was talking about .

it 's a short film .

jake .

i thought you were a businessman .

it 's cool . why do you think i got in the movies ? how much poon do you think you get in the car wash business ? look , fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy . you can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars . so why fuck with the movie business ?

i thought i 'd invest in a film . i want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film , meet the people who make films , learn how it 's done ...

oh . why is it that you want to get into film financing ?

what do you think of that ? or this ?

hold it , mister .

cool off , huh ? how 's this for cooling off ?

i do n't suppose you 've ever seen this girl before either ? her name 's kristen , but i suppose you 've never seen her ?

com'on , tell me .

to his own daughter ?

do you really think kristen is just a runaway ?

i 'll tell you , that was an interesting case . the van dorn girl . i 've handled runaway cases like it before . usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid , she pops up in about a week . everybody denies ever seeing her , but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home . well , i put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice . in fact , certain people for this girl and -- nothing . i guess i gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal .

the guy who bought you that ring .

nope never saw her before . kurt , come over here . do n't use underage kids . would n't touch 'em for all the cow shit in mexico . you recognize this piece of wool , kurt ?

look again , billy-boy . this is jail bait . could get you in a lotta trouble .

was he with a girl ?

because if you are ...

wait here .

where are the papers ?

oh , do n't get officious . you 're not yourself when you 're officious . that 's the curse of a government job .

lady , resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense . under the state criminal code , section 545 , paragraph 10-b ...

officer , i can explain .

possession of a stolen shovel .

none of that , lady .

all right , then , and we 'll be off . nice chatting with you .

could i see your registration ?

how long have you been driving ?

come again .

well , not all the southwest . although we do have a large business ... barley was very big last week ... fifteen hundred ...

she supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed .

i 'm a file clerk .

how interesting .

oh . it looks like a hearse . very nice . compact .

what kind of a car is it ?

a block of ice .

what do you want ?

oh ! that 's wonderful , harold . go - and love some more .

`` and this too shall pass away . ''

but why now ?

but , harold , we begin to die as soon as we are born . what is so strange about death ? it 's no surprise . it 's part of life . it 's change .

oh , harold ! what a fuss this is . so unnecessary .

but you 're not going anywhere , are you ?

farewell ?

it 's all right . it 's organic .

oh , you 've thought of everything . and champagne .

harold , that picture is almost twenty-five years old .

it looks like you . thanks .

why ?

yes .

maude .

yes . they 're old friends .

you sure have a way with people .

right on ! it would n't be a celebration without it .

that was n't very scary .

what ? with your skill and my experience ... i think we can come up with something .

they 'd put you in jail , eh ? well , historically you 'd be in very good company . that 's what my husband used to say when we were in the french underground dealing with the gestapo . would you like to do a little raking ? work , i 'm told , done with no selfish interest , purifies the mind . you sink your separate self and become one with the universal self . on the other hand , senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided .

really . just put it there , harold .

but they ca n't do that . you have n't even got the vote .

yodeling ?

no . i feel more like - yodeling .

spreckled with uncountable stars . the stars are shining right now . we just ca n't see them . just another instance of all that 's going on that is beyond human perception .

i like you , harold . come , i 'll teach you to waltz .

i like you , maude .

okay .

yes , so do i. but i think he is a little ... old-fashioned . like a puff , harold ?

i like glaucus .

do n't you think we should turn off the heat ?

well , i do n't ...

thank you .

some nuts ? some licorice ? it has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait .

he 's fallen asleep , as usual .

is he all right ?

oh , wait , maude . look !

we 'll transplant it . to the forest .

look at it , harold . it 's suffocating . it 's the smog . people can live with it , but it gives trees asthma . they ca n't breathe . see the leaves are all brown . harold , we 've got to do something about this life .

that 's a nice teapot .

you do n't look eighty .

no , you have to touch it . you have to run your hands over it , get close to it , really reach out and feel . you try it .

yes . very much .

oh , i 'm so happy you said that because i wanted to show you my paintings . this is the `` rape of rome '' and , of course , there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of leda and the swan .

do you often model for glaucus ?

maude ? ? ? !

promise ?

no .

but it 's oat straw tea . you 've never had oat straw tea , have you ?

she 's very sweet , but so old- fashioned . please sit down , harold . i 'll put on the kettle and we 'll have a nice hot cup of tea .

it 's very interesting .

yes .

eh , no .

well then , i must be off . we shall have to meet again .

how do you do ? i am dame marjorie chardin , but you may call me maude .

eh , could i have my pen back now , please ?

it 's a question of emphasis , you might say . accentuate the positive , so to speak .

you 're welcome . did you know him ?

oh ... that 's wonderful ... i get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law ! be reasonable , harold ! you 're dealing with your life ! what will people say ? !

to a girl . here .

to whom ?

mother . i 'm going to get married .

mother .

not now , harold ... you ca n't put me down for monday ?

i have a sore throat .

no . like this .

oh , is this your father ?

do you play ?

well , actually , it was the name of my drama teacher - louis sunshine . perhaps you 've heard of him . he was such an influence on the development of my instrument . that means my body - in theatre talk . well , when i came to hollywood i felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form , so i took on `` sunshine . '' dore is my real name ... well , dore , actually . my , what a lovely place you have here .

no , thank you . they stain my fingers .

ca n't complain .

we are not relating today , harold . i sense a definite resistance . a lack of true and helpful communication . i find you a very interesting case , harold , but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process , and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment . do you understand ?

yes .

your classmates ?

yes .

none at all ?

no .

is it the machines ? the noise ? the people ?

yes . what kind of things do you do ?

what about the draft ?

ah , yes .

she took my head .

stay where you are , harold .

harold !

harold ! that 's < u > disgusting < /u > !

to strangle someone . choke him . squeeze out his life between your hands .

oh sure .

oh , sure . a variety of weapons .

will they really teach me to shoot ?

another man 's life in your sights .

the moment of truth .

that 's right .

to pit your own life against another .

i hope so , sir . golly i never knew it could be so exciting .

well , you 'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own .

is that a fact ? well , that fits in right along with everything i 've been saying . war is not all black .

thank you , uncle .

yes , ma'am . somebody had some trouble parking .

good afternoon , officer . bit of trouble here ?

but wait ...

oh , yes . how did you like that ?

then i suppose it was me . get in , harold .

ah ! there you are , madam . were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday ?

we have no more surprises .

we 've always been here .

oh , kirsty ; so eager to play , so reluctant to admit it .

you knew ?

frank .

julia .

see ? he 's here . you should learn to believe your uncle frank .

sorry , friend . no day trips to hell . here you are . here you stay . and forward the only way to go .

it certainly is .

it 's coming .

no . you look ...

why ?

what do you mean ?

oh , jesus . i ca n't explain . it 's ... it 's . i do n't know how to help ! i have to save him and i do n't know how to help !

almost complete withdrawal . she has n't said a word for nearly two years .

what 's the matter with her ?

you a doctor , too ?

so ... you 're kirsty , huh ?

it 's you ! you have n't always been as you are . you were human . remember . remember all your confusions . think !

no , no , this one did n't escape . you told me you 'd always been in hell . you were wrong . look at it . look . it 's you .

what is this ? someone else you think escaped us , like frank ?

go on . but trick us again , child , and your suffering will be legendary even in hell .

but it 's true , he is his own hell . just as you are in yours .

i saw it ... him . but i got away . and i took the box . and i solved it . and they came .

he talked about demons , huh ?

oh , pardon me . i obviously did n't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value . no , you talk to me . but -- do me a favor ? -- none of this demons crap .

oh , excuse me ...

do n't worry . he 's o.k . we sent him home hours ago . jeez , what a story .

you 're in the malahide institute . it 's a psychiatric hospital . but , hey , do n't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you . remember ? you and your boyfriend ... ?

is he serious ? ?

i need to touch it to `` see '' ...

red . how long was it latched onto you ?

nah -- he 's taken care of .

nothing psychic about it . you 're easy .

do n't get psychic with me .

look at them ugly suckers , blue . one sheet of glass between them and us .

hound of resurrection --

red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --

i have seen ghosts , whitman .

amongst other things , yes -- but that 's hardly the point .

in private , if you do n't mind ...

that makes him more than a hundred --

tom -- he 's our guest , not a prisoner .

is it bad ?

do n't look ! turn around .

oh , stop that -- damn ! be careful , there --

well , i wo n't be around forever , you know ?

listen to me . this time is different . there 's more at stake than ever before .

son . about rasputin --

i 'm in way over my head , i know that much .

1958 , the occult war finally ends when adolf hitler dies .

`` in the absence of light , darkness prevails . '' for there are things that go bump in the night , agent myers . we are the ones who bump back .

where am i -- exactly , sir ?

this -- ? this is nothing . you know what 'll kill me ? her .

c'mon , champ . you look a little woozy , there .

we 're on the move .

`` myers '' , huh ? you have a first name ? ?

it is . you got yourself on tv again .

got tired of me ?

who 's the squirt ?

yup . sixty years old by our count . but he does n't age like we do -- think dog years : he 's barely out of his teens .

she 's dead .

my job .

you never , ever light a cigar that way .

you call that thing a cigar ? ?

each of us gets a belt .

what are you trying to say ?

how big can it be ?

not from you .

hostage negotiations .

professor , that girl you were talking about --

mmmh -- `` pamcakes . '' we 're going out --

could 've fooled me . go away .

no one ever helps me . it 's my job .

father 's back ? still angry ?

... polo .

listen . i 'm not like myers . he makes you feel like you belong . and -- that 's good . it really is . i -- wish i could do something about this -- but i ca n't . i can promise you only two things ... one : i 'll always look this good . two : i wo n't give up on you . ever .

no . myers is taking me .

out ? out out ?

well . is it long ? ? i 'm going out , but --

goodnight , then .

we miss you at the bureau . abe 's crazier every day . and father 's still mad at me -- come back , liz . come back . i --

what ?

coffee 's warming me up .

it 's freezing , is n't it ?

he -- loves you .

pardon ?

-- late . five minutes late .

who are you calling a fucking ass- hole ? it 's this bastard bed that 's your fucking problem !

what 's happening ?

want to buy a bed ?

damn right . now are we going to move the bed or not ?

it 'll go in .

eh , chas , slow it down like the man says .

he did . i 've seen him .

nobody escapes us .

let me alone , will you ?

no !

this is n't for real .

we 'll get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put .

first things first . you can have a telephone when we 've talked . do you know who did this to you ?

bastard .

do n't mourn him . he was dead long before we laid a finger on him .

oh my god .

some things have to be endured ...

you want it ?

i used to tell myself that . used to try and pretend i was dreaming all the pain . but why kid yourself ? some things have to be endured . take it from me . and that makes the pleasures so much sweeter ...

do n't touch me . or so help me --

come to daddy .

there 's very little i can do about it .

you ca n't love him .

so you were cheated .

you 're still afraid .

who did ?

sure . somewhere safe . safe . christ ! they tortured me here . in this room .

keep your voice down .

who ?

-- to heal me completely . then we can be away from here , before they come looking .

good .

i 'm hurting

no . god no .

help me .

no , damn you --

of course . there 's no need to shout .

i do n't know where to begin ...

oh baby .

who was it ?

o.k .

just a moment . put on some music will you babe ?

o.k .

can i get you anything ?

oh , babe ...

would you excuse me ? i think i 'm going to go to bed .

it 's probably going to need stitches .

you 're not going to faint .

is it deep ?

i cut myself .

in here .

larry !

all right .

you wanted to come back to london . we came back .

no . i 'm not .

you 're still blaming me .

how long since you were here ?

it 's just been empty a while .

maybe somebody changed the lock .

o.k . o.k .

yeah , why do n't i ?

why do n't you take off your jacket ? you 're warm .

what 's going on ?

i ... suppose so , yes .

well , is n't it ?

you want something to drink ?

plain soda ?

not much .

steve .

i called another friend of mine and he 's coming over . will you let him in ?

where are you going ?

please . you 're in danger .

what 's the problem ?

no you do n't .

i 'm afraid it 's true .

it 's all right , sweetheart . julia 's told me everything ; and it 's all right ...

sure .

she does n't even want to leave the house .

i love you , honey .

never better . you sleep well .

kitchen 's through on your left .

call me tomorrow .

of course . every day .

i said : i found a room .

where are you ?

will you go , damn you ?

what did i say ?

are you alright ?

well you 've just been talking to the wrong people .

we walk .

all right . no . that 's nice .

really ? married kevin ? her junior high sweetheart ... what chance would i have had against that ? none , no chance . that 's just fate .

you could n't be . look , barry . there 's going to be people from laura 's work there , people who own dogs and babies and tina turner albums . how are you going to cope with them ?

we 're not as bad as you think , rob .

110 % . that 's my final offer . i 'm not kidding . that 's how much it means to me not to hear you play .

so ? you even said they 're good .

what the fuck is that ?

oh . right . but i 'd forgotten about that . i was n't biting the idea .

fuck off , barry .

great ! that 's fucking great ! they only asked you to sing because of your name ! you can stick it above the browser racks over there .

you ca n't be called barry and sing in a group called barrytown .

you are not in a band , barry . you are not a musician . and no posters .

do n't be sad , barry . you 'll find true love someday .

how do you know about that ?

un-fucking-believable . dick 's out on a hot date , rob 's boning marie lasalle , and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us is n't getting anything at all .

well ... you could n't have been desperate to see it , otherwise you 'd have already gone ...

would you ... would you get the impression that i wanted to see it ?

no , but would you think , from that one sentence . that i was going to see it ?

there 's something different about the sound of her voice ... and what did she mean last night , she has n't slept with him yet . yet . what does `` yet '' mean , anyway ? `` i have n't seen ... evil dead ii yet . '' what does that mean ? it means you 're going to go , does n't it ?

ooh ! a kind of recent record ! rob 's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics ! nice ! `` let 's get it on ? '' could n't you make it more obvious than that ?

oh no , rob , that 's not obvious enough . not at all . dick , did you hear that ?

`` thunder road , '' bruce springsteen , from born to run . `` smells like teen spirit , '' nirvana , nevermind .

ehh .

what are you snickering about ?

it 's not my car , now is it ? it 's laura 's car , and thus laura has it . so it 's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab . wow . fucking great .

... maybe a picture of me in the liner notes ...

yeah .

what did he ever do to you ?

we 'll do it next monday .

great . that 's the fun of working in a record store . playing crappy pap you do n't want to listen to . i thought this tape was going to be , you know , a conversation stimulator . i was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a monday morning and all that , and you just had to ruin it .

how can it be bullshit to state a preference ?

turn it off , barry .

no -- !

they always seemed what ? they always seemed really great , is what they always seemed . they picked up where your precious echo left off , and you 're sitting here complaining about no more echo albums . i ca n't believe that you do n't own that record . that 's insane .

what 's your problem ? what did i ... why are you --

great . can i have it then ?

did you know that after that song was recorded , jan himself crashed his --

who are you going to see ?

that 's what i said .

it 's the new --

just that rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling nazi youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary . that 's all .

the malcolm mcclaren of clark street is in his executive suite . do you have an appointment ?

hey , barry .

`` somebody 's gon na die '' by blitz . `` bella lugosi 's dead , '' bauhaus . it 's got that creepy halloween feeling .

okay . `` dance music for old people ? ''

who ? oh . my friend . my friend is laura . a girl . a friend who 's a girl .

fine . that 's great .

nevermind . any five . so four more .

huh . you used to come to the club ? i should n't have let you in . you must have only been about sixteen .

well , i used to go to the dodger on your nights , and i saw you 're doing it again and that your putting out a record , and it 's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the chicago music scene with the emphasis on now .

i 'm looking for deejay rob gordon .

it 's all kind of lost in the ... in the dense mists of time now ... it was n't that i really liked marco more . in fact i thought you were more , shall we say , attractive than him . it was just that he knew he was good-looking and you did n't , and that made a difference somehow . you used to act as if i was weird for wanting to spend time with you , and that got kind of beat , if you know what i mean . your self-image started to rub off on me and i ended up thinking that i was strange . and i knew that you were kind and thoughtful ... you made me laugh , and i dug the way you got consumed by things you loved ... and marco seemed a bit more , i do n't know , glamorous ? more sure of himself ? less hard work , because i felt like i was dragging you around , sort of . a little sunnier . sparkier . i do n't know . you know what people are like at that age . they make very superficial judgements . do you think that 's superficial ? he was a clown , if it 's any consolation .

hey rob .

what is this .

you 're a horrible person , barry . i mean it .

i 'm sorry , rob , that 's , it 's --

do n't worry about it , dick . barry 's an asshole .

i will now sell four copies of cats and dogs by the royal trux .

i want a tape .

sure . 'course . rob , look . do you want to ... talk about it , that kind of thing ?

or rather , bad news and good news , because he likes this person playing tonight . i mean , he liked laura too , i did n't mean that . and he likes you . it 's just that --

fine .

well , i 'll just make it for you .

yeah , i have n't really absorbed that one .

'morning , dick .

i 'm upset , but i 'm fine .

i dunno .

we wo n't leave it , ian . not ever .

we are not talking jokey understatement here , rob . we 're talking actionable harassment . ten phone calls a night , hanging around outside my house ...

i 'm an idiot . i should have played the record first . this place is about to get burned down .

i mean , maybe you 're right . but were you really expecting me to say yes ?

fair enough .

well forgive me if i do n't think of you as the world 's safest bet .

i 'm sorry . but two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for the reader , were n't you ?

ha ha ha . hoo hoo hoo .

are you worried about tomorrow night ?

i know . i do n't get it .

yeah . his band is playing a set .

barry said its done .

that 's not the point . i mean , what if the single is n't done in time ?

you had no right . supposing i was doing something that could n't be cancelled ?

has drag city records , i know , i know . you told dan koretzky about this ?

i called dan koretzky because he --

oh . well . we do n't really get along . paul and i .

where ?

less neurotic . are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life ?

but why does n't it matter that we 're not the same people we used to be ?

but what ?

look , rob . if great sex was as important as you think it is , and if i was having great sex with him , then we would n't be lying here now . and that is my last word on the subject , okay ?

to make you feel better .

it was like sex . what else could it be like ?

want to know what , exactly ?

let 's go home . okay ?

i 'm too tired not to go out with you .

look , we can do other things .

i knew there was a reason i wore a skirt today .

hi .

i 've only got a couple left . i 'm saving them for later .

when are you going back ?

i do n't want to go back .

you 're soaking .

yes , of course .

look , are you coming or not ?

in a minute . when i get it together .

my dad died . my dad , my dad .

you 're being deliberately obtuse .

oh ho , so very infrequently .

i 'll bet you ca n't remember what you were doing here , can you ? i mean , how much are you making now ? sixty ? seventy ? and you were living in this shitty place .

yep . i might have missed some stuff . i 'm so used to some things being here that i do n't even notice them .

you do n't ever think about other people ?

i 'm not experimenting . why do n't you go experiment .

we can meet for another drink if you want . so i can explain it better . i owe you that much .

i want you to say that you have n't , and i want it to be the truth .

hi . i 've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and i 'm thinking i did n't take them with me . have you seen them around ?

the sleeping together is better but not the sex because you have n't done it was him yet .

is what better ? better than what ?

nevermind .

no problem . if i can ask one question .

okay , okay , we have a nine percent chance of getting back together . does that clarify the situation ?

so we have a chance of getting back together again .

i do n't know .

rob . do n't be childish .

what , what ?

no .

not really .

and do you like it that way ?

yeah , sure . more so then than i am now . that 's life though , is n't it ?

you used to care more about things like marvin gaye than you do now . when i first met you , and i made you that tape , you loved it . you said -- and i quote -- `` it was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection . ''

is that right ? i 'd like a word with him .

-- made . made . marvin gaye is dead , his father shot him in --

jeez . he goes on long enough .

maybe i 've been a little unfair . but is this really the time ?

enough , liz .

so the minister says nice things , and then , what , we all troop outside and they bury him ?

well she --

rob ! two years ago you got laura pregnant ; you then proceeded to cheat on her ! you borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back ! and then , just a few weeks ago , you told her you were unhappy with her and were `` kind of looking around for somebody else ! ''

to think i sympathized with you for two seconds ! poor rob ! laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs . you let me believe that !

-- no , no , no , do n't even . i talked to laura , rob . i talked to her and she gave me a little background . and you 're a fucking asshole .

right .

god , you ask a lot of questions .

good .

yeah .

when i said before that i hoped it was n't the end of the evening , i was , you know ... talking about breakfast and stuff .

tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees rob , standing and holding his jacket .

whiskey .

i 'm sure it is n't .

yeah , but you know what 's his best film and nobody 's even seen it ?

yeah , i know the crumblers ! i bought a used blasters album in new york about ten years ago and somebody left a crumblers single in it . my everything changed for a couple of weeks .

yeah , but if you heard this band called the crumblers , you 'd --

awhile back , dick and barry and i agreed that what really matters is what you like , not what you are like ...

well i do n't know what happens now , apart from you meet someone , you move in , she goes . you meet someone , you move in , she goes .

mom ! for the last fucking time , i 'm telling you laura did n't want to get married ! she is not that kind of girl ! to use a phrase . that 's not what happens now .

so you say . i 'd like to hear her side of it .

i knew this was going to happen .

well call her mother .

your lucky laura 's doing so well . if it was n't for her , i do n't think either of us would ever sleep ...

great . super-fantastic .

hi , mom .

okay . because you took the trouble to come up here . and because you 've got principles . but that 's it . i 'm not selling them to you one by one .

seventy-five .

sixty .

look . can i pay you properly ? you do n't have to tell him what you got . send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest . give it to charity . or something .

i know what they 're worth . give me fifty and get them out .

nice .

we saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin ' for a renaissance fair .

wait a minute . island records charged u2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride .

no , we ...

he 'd want to know about all this .

maybe he 's hiding from something .

does n't have a head , does he ?

have you spoken to anyone else about this ?

well , this is a small town , and it was even smaller then . most all the babies i delivered were from local families . richard 's parents were just passing through when his mother 's time came . i did it right here at the house .

no thank you , i 'm fine .

the emptyness . the years and years of void . nothingness . bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness . who would have guessed ?

what 's wrong ?

gettysburg 's an hour 's drive at most . you should be back by nightfall .

but you 're known so much . history i 'll only read about .

what is it like ? being you ?

of bodies .

i carried that rifle in world war i. this book is a 16th century policy report for the king of austria . the diploma is my con- ference of degree in latin from trinity college . class of 1672. it goes on .

who are you ?

why are you here ?

a factor of age .

then you must be at least 70 years old .

no . just the child of some lonely girl i gave a ride to . when they died i put them in a grave with my name on it . twenty years later i became the son .

yes .

and you are william taupin , are n't you ?

follow me .

i thought it might be a nice break from all of this .

they do it each year .

the estate stuff is pretty straight forward . just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat .

yes .

the less exposure i recieve around government buildings the better . you , as mrs. taupin , will attract considerably less attention than i .

you make it all sound so simple .

you did kill those men .

no . i had to talk to you .

are you ?

go home .

i 'm a historian , mr. taupin . only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face .

you are being foolish .

i 'd rather hear yours .

he 's dead . whatever i may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now .

that bothers you ?

i left a man dead in felton . but you do n't really care , do you ?

not your concern .

he called you `` macleod '' .

who is he ?

he tried to kill me last night .

i doubt that . good day , miss cartwright .

miss cartwright , you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you . i strongly suggest you return to washington and stay out of small town cemetaries .

you have an active imagination .

does carl smith ?

probably .

grave robbers ?

have you taken to touring small town cemetaries , miss cartwright ?

someone beat you .

miss cartwright , what is it i can do for you ?

very traditional .

it 'll never stick .

what are you getting at , moran ?

but there 's more . wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in felton , delaware . some locals spotted two cars with d.c. plates and surprise surprise , they turn out to be registered to our own brenna cartwright and the ever popular richard taupin .

four ?

he 's too cool . too sharp . i think he 's got something to do with it .

stop !

-auditorium nostrum-

go ahead , senor . i have my friend to keep me company .

i am not ready for this .

you have not been fully trained . but you will learn . and you will be good , i can feel that . you have apt- itude . this is why our friend is so concerned .

if that was meant to be an ex- planation mr. romirez from spain , i 'm afraid you 've failed .

and what is this great gift that can not be seen or smelt ?

it will take less effort as you learn .

harder . concentrate harder .

how can i stop such a man ?

you have done nothing wrong conor macleod .

this ca n't be .

listen to me . hear the words .

it is less .

you are the same ?

you scots have a way with game . it still has life in it . spirit . back home the food is so ... domestic .

first food , no ? a good meal makes conversation so much easier .

i should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers , perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation . and a solution .

and but for a mark you are well as any man , no ?

please go to no trouble .

your name is conor ?

so why the crazy talk ? it 's a miracle it is . saint andrew has smiled on me . on us .

that 's wonderful . where did you ever learn it ?

like you .

our common heritage . i am your only real friend , you know . the only one who truly understands you . i look forward to the day we meet again . and i kill you .

you 're wrong .

no doubt .

it 's all we have .

i doubt much can change that . the enemy has five brigades waiting for us .

who do you think i am ? one of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow ? `` threaten you '' ? you and i just living will always be a threat . forever . look at your life , major . look at mine . nothing there but threat . threats and nothingness . it 's what we live for .

we must talk .

it never changes , major .

it can be different . it must be .

equals ?

he 's a macleod .

ah , conor , how you look a man .

my father taught me .

fish are creatures of habit . they like their food where they 're used to it . at the top , hiding in old leaves .

wo n't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon . looks good though . they found the receipt in his townhouse . it was pretty smeared but had taupin 's father listed as a signatory .

we ran down that church hill info . she 's right . there is no richard taupin .

_answer_ me .

none of this would be happening if you had n't run ...

he knows i 'm here . how ?

you 're wrong .

tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have . all else is just marking time . you 're marking time .

you 're insane .

good times then . a man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears . not like now .

had a great swing with his blade . for a pope .

neuvich , the clown of the crusades .

how did you find me ?

kahn ?

leave her alone .

go to hell .

i have waited forever for this . you will not cheapen it , little boy .

as you wish .

you disappoint me . i thought you 'd finally gotten over that sort of thing .

macleod !

run !

of sorts .

friend of yours ?

should i care ?

and if i refuse ?

look , i do n't know what the hell you 're up to , but i think i 've got a pretty good idea .

a neighbor saw your car leave .

it was covered with mr. fasil 's fingerprints , but none of his blood .

your murder weapon ?

that 's none of your business .

american .

i was walking by when i heard a shout . your men came right after .

i 'm sure that 's true .

yes sir . when you get older your priorities change . it 's the simple things that count . without them growing old can be a very lonely thing .

you 're one of william 's kids , huh ?

when your father died i saw to it that the grounds were kept up .

the sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life , but he says nothing can interfere with his duty .

who is it ?

bon jour !

au revoir , mon capitaine .

seventy-five .

no . roy . roy v .

what ?

oh , did you -- care for the poem , mr. burns ?

i should say not ! that was one swell story you had in the paper this morning .

excuse me , i just want to --

just a second , walter . here , bruce , here 's the check ... and , oh , bruce , here 's your wallet . i got it back .

oh , yes . here it is .

no , i was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly .

oh -- mother -- she -- i do n't know where she went .

oh , she was here .

bruce , you know i 'm mad about you and stop talking like that . walter !

hildy !

yes , he is ... look , bruce , we 're taking that next train -- and when i say next train , this time i mean it !

i 'm sure you have n't any .

that 's right here . gee , it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition .

all right . i 've done it . now , are you satisfied ?

oh , he 's not the man for you . i can see that . but i sort of like him . got a lot of charm .

there 's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around .

the money ? why ?

she 's -- well , she 's very motherly . that 's about the best description i know .

and i 'll take that certified check , too . i 've decided i can handle things around here ...

hildy !

well , i got to get back . you can find your way out , ca n't you ?

thanks a lot .

that 's all i ask . oh , wait a minute .

well , she 'll know some day .

i 'm beginning to realize that .

and remember this , bruce ! i love her , too .

oh -- an hour for the interview . another hour to write it .

i sometimes wish i 'd taken out insurance -- but , of course , now it does n't matter . still , i suppose it would have been the smart thing to do .

i do n't blame them .

how 's business , bruce ?

that 'll be nice . a home with mother . a real honeymoon . in albany , too . ow !

i know i was n't a good husband , hildy , but you can always count on me .

mother ? but your mother --

feels awful good . yes , sir -- we 're taking the four o'clock train to albany and tomorrow we 'll be married .

where are we going ?

mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all .

yes !

i 've just told you i was busy with mr. bruce baldwin !

what 's this ?

you 're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we 're pulling your nose out of the feed bag .

i 'm warning you -- it 'll be a federal offense . and you 'll be an accessory !

you will , eh ? well , we 'll see about that . all right , boys . take it .

i 'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is .

you ca n't bluff me , burns . i do n't care who you are or what paper you 're editor of .

what did you say your name was -- pinkus ?

that 's absurd on the face of it , mr. burns ! he 's talking like a child .

this is the morning post you 're talking to !

yes -- 'hildy , darling ' . i 'm just a fool . that 's what i am . i know what it 's going to be like .

well , i 'd like to be lady-like and think it over .

niagara falls ! walter , you do n't mean that ?

hildy , if that 's what you want , all right . we 'll even go to -- how about niagara falls ?

both jobs are open , hildy . the paper -- and being mrs. walter burns .

sure .

yeah . only -- only i 'm not leaving , walter .

sorry , hildy . i did n't mean to be making love to another man 's fiancee .

we sure did , but we had to go in hiding for a week .

remember the time we broke into the d.a . 's office , and copied fifi randell 's diary ?

i mean -- working together . just like the old days . the things we 've been through , hildy .

no !

who says so ? i 'm going to the morgue -- to look --

hello -- hello ...

louie , where 'd it happen ? i 'm going out !

what happened ?

what did you do with her ?

is he coming back here ?

how about the time he had his house painted by the fire department ?

where 's some paper ?

not if he 's inside the desk . we 'll carry the desk over . give me duffy !

i get it !

do n't get technical at a time like this ! do you realize what you 've done ? you 've taken a city that 's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you 're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that new york 's having under la guardia ! we 'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next tuesday that nobody 'll vote for them -- not even their wives !

hold on a minute .

never mind it ? that 's not my money ! that 's bruce 's money !

yes -- - and that 's putting it mildly ! no certified check -- no story -- get me ?

you keep out of this . bruce , suppose you examine mr. burns in his office . i 'll get my bag and go over to the press room in the criminal courts building . you phone me as soon as mr. burns has given you his check . then i 'll go get the interview and you phone mother that we 're taking the six o'clock train . and no tricks , walter !

what do you mean ?

well , it 's either an act on your part or a miracle on sweeney 's .

you see what i had to put up with ? she never trusted me ! you argue with her -- otherwise you 're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands !

especially with an election coming up in a few days .

the colored vote happens to be very important to the mayor of this town .

if he 's nuts , why does n't the state just put him away ?

what now ?

well , i 'll tell you one thing , old man , she never looked at me the way she 's looking at you .

how do you like that ? here i am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that 's the thanks i get !

allow me .

and he takes his hat off when he 's with a lady .

you would n't believe this , walter , but bruce holds the door open for me .

you 're not afraid , are you ?

well , he 's waiting in the anteroom for me now .

well , i 'll give you a hint . by tomorrow they 'll be calling me mrs. bruce baldwin .

say , sounds more like a guy i ought to marry . what 's his name ?

he does , does he ? how did i treat you -- like a water buffalo ?

it 's a good , honest business , is n't it ?

a journalist ! peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think hitler 's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen ! i know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets , and for what ? so a million hired girls and motormen 's wives will know what 's going on ! no , walter , i 'm through .

look at this !

all right -- thirty-five , and not a cent more !

well , have n't you got anybody else ?

dead ?

well , you practically did ! making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till i broke down . and i still claim i was tight the night i proposed . if you 'd been a gentleman you 'd have forgotten all about it . but not you !

well , the paper 'll have to learn to do without me . and so will you . it just did n't work out , walter .

i made a great reporter out of you , hildy , but you wo n't be half as good on any other paper , and you know it . you need me and i need you -- and the paper needs both of us .

well , go on and take it . work for somebody else ! that 's the gratitude i get for --

you mean you 're not coming back to work here ?

i have a lunch date . i just want --

was it my fault ? did i know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in ? i meant to be with you on our honeymoon , hildy -- honest i did .

oh , yes i would . i 'd know you any time --

you know what . how long since we 've seen each other ?

why , i 'm surprised , mr. burns . that 's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she 's no longer your wife .

you stay here . i 'll find out everything .

i do n't think she 's talking much ... you know what i mean ?

now everything 's fine . she 's probably squawking her head off in some police station .

yeah ! well , i do the firing , too . remember that , duffy , and keep a civil tongue in your head .

walter !

i ca n't hildy . it means my job ! it means --

there 's money in it , cooley .

come , come , sheriff , lightning does n't strike in the same place twice . nothing 's going to happen .

i do n't know --

well , i do n't know if that 's ethical . you see , all statements are supposed to come from me .

me , too .

you said it !

well , it was n't exactly that way --

yes , sir .

aw , why do n't you let her alone ? she 's ill !

i know , i just want to give him a thrill .

come on , you ! before we slap you down .

i tell you , it 's a screwy set-up . we better hold onto 'em both .

oh , you two are pals now -- i think you 're right , endicott . mollie did give her some kind of story .

something smells around here . if you ask me mollie gave her the story on how williams got that gun . did you smuggle that gun into williams , mollie ?

so have we !

call you back .

lioness rushes to defense of cub .

what 's the use ? i ca n't win a pot .

she says she 's gon na write fiction .

do n't you remember ? he 's the guy went to washington to interview the brain trust , and gave out a statement that they were all sane . it created a sensation !

yeah ? what did he ever do for his country ?

we know what you 're up to .

you ai n't gettin ' out o ' here !

gus , this --

no -- just coffee , gus .

what ?

all right , boys . take her along . i got ways of making her talk .

that 's awful kind of you , sheriff . i 've got to get started on my interview . see you later .

oh , that 'll be all right , hildy . go ahead , run it . and you can say i treated him well , too . 'lo , earl . how are you feeling ?

all right , then , i 'll just run the story that sheriff hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner . of course , with election coming , that might do you a lot of harm , but just as you say .

i gave strict orders that nobody was to interview williams without my permission .

where he used to live . you can catch the riot squad -- it 's just going out .

howard shenken , the sheriff 's uncle on his mother 's side --

after all i 've done for you --

a fine fair-weather friend you are !

four of mr. hartman 's deputy sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --

what went off ?

this tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of sheriff hartman 's bombing squad .

no , i could n't do that .

yeah . but i --

for who ?

i was just going to !

that 's a lie ! !

who is this man ?

a sight for sore eyes !

i do n't know , fred . there 's that reprieve if they ever find out .

what ?

dementia praecox oh-h-h !

williams ai n't a red , and you know it !

our families , fred . i 've always looked on bessie as my own sister .

fred !

twelve dollars ! -- for those rheumatic uncles of yours ? out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it ?

pete , i want to talk to you !

i hope you 're pretty nearly through with me , doctor , i 'm getting a little fatigued .

now , hildy , do n't be hasty ! i ca n't let him out .

all right . you ca n't . but tomorrow the post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd street that your brother-in-law runs . and we 'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it !

do n't hildy me ! are you going to let him out ?

nobody 's going to rush me into anything ! you keep away from me !

-- you were with her . you were in the cab , were n't you ?

what did you do with her ?

any news ?

okay . forget it .

if walter burns calls , hold the wire for me , will you ? i 'll be right back .

you fight it cut .

what -- already ? why , the dame left only a minute before i did !

thanks . so long , hildy !

keep your shirt on . i got it -- right here . one hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty . now sign .

hildy , i thought you were gone --

that 's good .

i do n't know what she 's talking about . i never said any such thing .

mother !

stop screaming , mollie or we 're sunk . i 'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back .

down the drainpipe . i did n't mean to shoot him . you believe me , do n't you , mollie ?

what 's that ? only -- you 're getting too near . i do n't trust anybody .

yes -- that 's right . production for use .

sure . you see , i 'd never had a gun in my hand before and i did n't know what to do with it . well , when i get stuck , i know that there 's an answer for everything in production for use . so it came to me in a flash : what 's a gun for ? to shoot ! so i shot . simple is n't it ?

it 's the only answer . everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose , we could solve all our problems . food was meant to be eaten , not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved ; clothing was meant to be worn , not piled up in stores while people went naked . does n't that make sense ?

how would you go about applying the golden rule , earl ?

they 're very simple . i believe in the golden rule . i 'm not the first man to die for preaching it . but if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine , decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things .

you did n't mean to kill that policeman ?

i could n't plead insanity , because you see i 'm just as sane as anybody else .

shut up , you !

ssh !

they got him surrounded some place -- gon na shoot him like a dog !

you 're insane !

no ! it 's easy -- it 's very easy !

you forgot to tell me what a city sealer has to do .

all right , mr. pinkus , all you 've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut . here ! go to this address . it 's a nice , homey little place , and they 'll take care of you for the night . just tell 'em fred sent you . and here 's fifty dollars on account .

come in and see me in my office tomorrow . what 's your name ?

why not ?

the what ?

-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun would n't work , so --

we want to see you .

come on , fellas .

i give that marriage six months .

baldwin -- his name is .

well -- williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he 's got to save the world . only he makes his speeches , usually , on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it . well , the cops let him alone as much as they can because he 's harmless and they 're kinda sorry for him . but one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a veteran 's parade and the cops chase him . he gets scared and goes into hiding . come in , dave schwartz .

you 'll be at home for the weekends . now shut up , or walk .

with mrs. evans . i hate her .

i have to live in rosehill avenue as well .

i think you hit him , grandpa . he was limping when he ran off .

put your hand on mine , get the knack of it .

can i try ?

what 's that ?

sod .

say them .

yes .

you want to join our gang ?

liar . mummy keep still and daddy moves on top of her . that 's what they do when they know how .

pauline .

it 's easy . i 've done it .

you do it . you 're a girl .

would .

it 's canadian . where 'd you get it ?

they 've got the real thing outside .

the next one is ours . either it hits us or it goes past us .

the land and the king are one , my son . if he stutters we falter . he 's getting batter , and so are we .

but dad , it 's the news .

the sodding water table .

big berthas , shelling france . twenty-five-mile range , they have .

what is it ?

boy , that was some air-raid .

a bit too quick .

so you 're going to be a grandfather .

do n't panic ! keep your head !

there is all right . this hitter fellow . we 've got to winkle him out . and get shot of some of our lot at the same time .

there was talk of planting some when we first came .

why not ?

what about it ?

what kind of war is this mac ? up there in cumberland , we never see an air-raid . the worst problem i have is getting a new typewriter ribbon . when i rode in against the turks , i knew what it was about .

what did we know ? we were seventeen .

when do you think you 'll get leave again ?

well ?

how do we know they did n't plant it there ? they know we 're mad on jam . they could poison half the country .

we do n't know anything about it

and what 's that ?

oh , that .

we all had to write a last letter home .

they 'd gone .

no turks .

now take deep breaths , and push .

it 's not . it 's happening to me .

who said anything about love ?

you better bring him home , if you really love him . do n't kill love . you 'll regret it for the rest of your life .

out .

i wo n't have this vulgar talk in my house .

that 's why you never liked me . i 'm different from you . well , everything 's different now , so it does n't matter . so there .

tell me the truth . you had to get married , did n't you ? because of me .

what would we do if a german came into the house ?

he always knows .

you know it ? it must be an old one .

just ignore her , mac .

or what ?

bless you , mac . what would i have done without you ?

he could always make me laugh .

not loving enough . that is a terrible thing to do to someone . i suppose i did it to clive . always held something back .

a polish pilot . it 's like one of those jokes on the wireless .

happy days . when you 're bigger , bill , i 'll teach you the googly .

mac , that was wonderful . i have n't been to a concert since ...

what can you do with four daughters , i asked myself , a string quartet was all i could come up with . they hated me for making them learn .

happy as can be . in the old groove .

you know something , molly ? i like it on my own . i never got used to sharing a bed , not really .

i agree .

the lions were totally covered in this guy 's blood ... i think they ate his face off , tore open his rib cage , pulled his legs off ... it was a wild scene .

i know i hate swiss cheese , the holes make me nervous .

any cone , yeah ... i hate that word ... sounds ugly , i do n't like crumple either .

yeah , it 's a tree . i used to play there all the time . but , you ca n't find it without me . outsider ca n't find no deadwood .

really , that 's a long time .

yeah , i like the screaming too ... it 's so much more exciting .

who 's your daddy !

come on , ma ... this bitch 's got it coming .

i 'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat .

go tell him to get your grandpa .

oh , he was already gone before i seen him ... but tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel .

ai n't the only thing tasty in this house .

no . there 's a bunch a us 'round somewhere ... i think mamma 's sleepin ' . she sleeps a lot , now ... do you want marshmallows ?

yeah , come on .

he left !

christ , you scared the shit out of me .

ok , whatever . let 's go get your brother 's truck . faster we get the truck , faster we get out of here .

couple more miles up this road .

where 's that ?

why ? you gon na do something about it ?

you should n't a done that .

he walks , duh .

oh , wonderful . fucking psycho .

what the hell are you laughing about ?

i was just wondering , cause you got a pissy look about you ... like a real pussy licking bitch .

i 'd like to see that .

the animals have got nothing to do with it .

come on , bro . let 's go .

keep the change and get yourself a new name .

i 'll bet you do ... how much we owe ya ... ... goober ?

you all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people .

well fuck me side sally , who want to read about all that horse shit anyway .

y'all find us country people real funny like do n't ya ... well , god damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits , i'ze a got ta get me some schooling .

but suppose for a second you did .

i do n't .

you see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions . you know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country .

i figured that much . why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for ?

yeah , i was never that big of a western fan . i like science fiction .

hell , boy there some other duke you know about ? a great american .

yeah , my pa was n't right in the head after that .

no , really .

i ca n't believe what i 'm seeing .

whatever , at this point all i care about is food . i 'm starving and i got a fucking killer headache .

no problem .

do n't forget the flashlight , it 's pretty dark out there .

tire 's fucking gone crap on us , man . there 's no saving it now .

jesus christ , jerry .

she looks like she stinks .

come on , we need something like this . it could be the real deal . it 's too far out of the way to come back to .

perfect .

then the devil asks , `` do you drink ? '' guy says , `` yeah '' ... devil say , `` wonderful , wednesday is free drinks night , best booze you ever had ... all made from the finest stuff . ''

hot has got nothing to do with it .

i 'll let it slide , she was only seventeen .

fuck yeah , she is . i 'd join a cult to get some of that ... and the best part is she did n't try to kill the president or nothing , so that baggage ai n't hanging around .

oh yeah , i forgot about her . she was pretty hot .

there always one kid with no bodily controls . we had this dude , jeff baxter , he was a puker . the fucker would just sit there puke all over himself .

yeah but , she reminds me of this chick that i remember from fourth grade ... called a ... shit , what did we call her ? oh yeah , patty pee-pee pants ... when ever she got called on by miss chumski , this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling .

i suppose . i mean they 're obviously all bonkers , but i guess they 're harmless .

man , it 's already ten thirty .

just grin and bear it .

turn that fucking radio off !

fuck ! we are fucked !

it wo n't work .

check this out .

whatever it is just do it . the more we play along the faster we 'll get the hell out of here .

fine ! i 'll go straight !

fine . i 'll go straight .

let 's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something .

hey , he moved .

then run him over , he 'll move .

there 's not enough room .

where ya headed ?

should we stop ?

well , do n't even think about playing the good samaritan , there 's way too many psychos wandering loose these days .

alright , alright . i know ... i wanted to be the photographer .

how 's about you give me those same directions .

hmmmmmmmmm ?

come on , get with the facts .

well , i 'll try but i do n't know nothing 'bout nobody . i 'm a guy who likes to mind his own business , if ya get what i 'm saying .

had to take him to the hospital . kid had dr. zaius stuck half way up his butt , could n't get it out .

yeah , i guess , you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes .

worse than a fucking rabid baboon .

hmmmmm .

yeah , my poor baby . it 's his daddy 's fault . i mean earl was a good man ... i mean he never hit me or nothing , but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all .

you 'll have to forgive tiny , he ca n't hear so much .

that was good babe , just keep doing that .

i know , but we can make it out of here . we can do it .

i ca n't ... i ca n't move my arms . i hurt so much .

i do n't know , i think he 's funny .

dude , your chick 's a little high strung .

yeah , jerry , she said some pretty fucked shit to us .

so what ?

yeah ?

now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16 .

so .

fuck , it 's freezing .

yeah , well he 's still here . i think him and jerry are fast becoming buddies , you know jerry ... yeah , he 's got ta see everything ... yeah , i know ... thinks there 's some unsolved mystery around every corner .

oh yeah , yeah i 've driven by that place before . i seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place .

a couple hours !

shhhhhh , quiet .

wait ... quiet . turn off the radio .

what ? i did n't hear anything .

you got to be fucking joking .

maybe he 's a cyborg .

geez , he never gets tired does he .

scattered , smothered and covered .

a decent meal every once in a while would n't hurt either , this road food is crap .

i know , that was some crazy shit . i never in a million years would have believed it if i had n't seen it .

yeah , hey how far do you think we are from your dad 's ?

i swear i 've aged five years since this trip started .

too late . you 're in for life , let 's move it out private shutterbug .

rise and shine .

keys .

please , let us go , we wo n't tell anybody .

no , no , no it 's so much more special than that ... you 'll see , you 'll be the first to ever see . i think this is something you 'll really love .

for the show . it 's halloween eve and time for our show .

and i 'm gon na help put the razor blades in the candy apples .

you did n't see the look she threw me . she 's up to something .

oh , do n't blow everything out of proportion .

god damn it , i must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch .

you said it , not me .

i 'll go . it 's my fault .

i think we should go straight . i mean we know for a fact there ai n't nothing back that way , right ?

i 'm gon na go ask him .

no , just a little too old .

oh , i get it ... i guess you think you 're too good for the simple pleasures of halloween .

you , my dear worm feeder , are about to become immortalized .

please , just a minute .

my name is lt. wydell , i 'd like to ask you a few questions .

aw , you ai n't disturbing me , but it kind of looks like rain , do n't ya think ?

that 's true , otis ... not that we 're having a bad time , but ...

yes ! i 'm the one who beats you when you 're bad ...

call wydell .

shhhh ... you hear that ?

turn up this road .

i 'm sure there 's a logical explanation .

oh , yeah , you know about that ? hmmm , that 's a strange one .

mr. willis ?

chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house . guy 's an ex-cop , thinks he can help .

you know , your hyper sensitive spidey senses ... like spider-man ... ... you know , like in the comics .

yeah ... ... huh , what the hell are you talking about ?

and think about what you 've done .

no `` buts . '' go to your room now .

like father , like son .

you better believe they 're dirty ! and smelly ! and messy ! and they do n't know their forks from their assholes !

where do we look for little lost puff ?

we still have you and i .

i want our boy back .

i do n't know .

a penny for your thoughts , mon cheri .

so we 've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements , my wonderful men .

do n't be silly ! and you were wonderful , too ! i loved the way you said `` au revoir . ''

of course not , that swedish thief ! he 's a thief of hearts ! i love you , gabrielle .

no !

anyway . come already to the point .

like what ?

unnhh .

no ! it is now that you must decide . i love you , doctor nathan ... ... but i will not wait . i will not be your chippy . i will not be your little mademoiselle parlez-vous side dish . my love . i want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly ... from you .

gabby , you know i 'm trying to sort things out .

what is it ?

stop . get away .

my little french .

very well .

not in front of the boy .

fine .

hmmph . hmmph . nathan , we have to talk , you and i .

funny . i thought that 's exactly what you did . you just do n't have the courage to admit it to yourself .

what is wrong , my darling ?

thank you so much . merci . it 's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment .

really ? no . not at all . you 're a very pretty girl . you should know that . you should be confident .

really ? i always think myself so ugly . no , not ugly , but plain . a wallflower .

i should n't say this , but you 're pretty , gabrielle . it 's unprofessional , i know .

i 'm fine . life is funny , that 's all .

coincidence , yes ? and how is our son ?

listen , you 're the best assistant i 've ever had ... gabrielle .

of course not .

well , i do n't know . i 'm actually on my way to ...

oh , hi , gabrielle .

oui . perfect !

really ? my day ? well , i had a sweet little mongrel puppie named puff when i was a girl . this one reminds me of my dog , all shaggy ! so cute ! i loved my doggie very much , monsieur .

oui .

no . this is the end of the road . there 's a dead human being here . for all of his faults , he was a human being , and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody .

we bury the body . we disappear into the woods . nobody knows .

very well .

sha n't happen again .

and i 'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me .

done !

why did n't your brother tell you that nathan was having an affair ?

lila , it 's rosie .

well he was n't really a midget . he was on the cusp of midgethood . that 's what made it cheap . had he been an actual midget , there would 've been nothing cheap about it , my dear .

no . i married a midget .

i can not believe how in love i am with this man .

god , he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff .

my brother says the guy 's a thirty- five year old virgin , so maybe he wo n't know how women usually feel . plus he 's got bad eyesight , almost legally blind , which is helpful in this situation . plus he 's got an extremely small penis , of which he is `` mortifyingly ashamed '' , so chances are he 'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention , that he 'll be yours forever .

my brother is discreet .

always . ow .

ouch . yeah ?

yeah , well , i 'm sorry . the human heart is a strange thing .

and what did you do tonight , honey ?

shit .

you were gone a long time .

puff , i 'm proud of you ! you did remarkably well under difficult circumstances .

thank you very much for that .

i let her sell her soul . i stood by as she did it . it 's inexcusable . at the time though i thought it might help .

such as my man and how to please him ! such as making wonderful dinners for my man ! such as looking pretty for my man ! and i 'm writing an article on quilting for the ladies home journal !

yes ! and i want to help . you wo n't have to pay me , and i was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway .

oh yes , baby ! i think that this is a wonderful project you 're doing , taking this poor unfortunate , uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being ! what a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are !

have you ?

i guess .

no . i do n't want your work to be cruddy .

cruddy , okay ? are you satisfied ?

i 'll make it . i 'm so happy , nathan ! everything 's going to be so great ! scotch on the rocks , right ? just kidding . i know what you drink , mister . i know what you drink . voila !

oh ! i did n't see you there , sneaky boy ! you 're like a boy sneaking in ...

that 's great .

do you like my new look ?

no .

everything 's fine , honey . we do n't need to talk . besides i have to work late .

good . making progress .

was that okay ? i mean , was i able to ... satisfy you ?

who is it ?

uh-huh . right , gabrielle . right .

great . grab his feet . we 'll throw him in the trunk .

freedom 's just another word for nothing left to lose , lila , to quote janet jackson .

i wo n't allow you . it 's wrong . he 's happy here .

do n't you see ? he 's my tabula rasa , my eliza dolittle . he 's my ticket to the top of the behaviorist food chain . he 's going to make me famous .

forget mice ! actually forget guinea pigs , cats , monkeys , and chimps also . i 'm on to stage five : the human subject .

what ?

he looks perfectly fine .

no . too ... upright . might 've been a person .

what ?

did you see that ?

flares ?

i think i 'll get johannsen in chemistry on that . oh ! did you bring the first aid kit ?

of course .

oh , and the sun block ?

darling , did you bring the insect repellent lotion ?

shaving cream ?

terrific . ca n't wait !

why certainly !

of course . i simply love the ... naturalness of it all .

what are you doing in there ?

actually , mother and father , you look very , very old . you look terrible .

no biggie .

tell her , harold ... it 's just that ... it 's nothing . it 's just that the outside fork is the salad fork . one goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses .

courtesy , decorum , manners , are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse . rudeness , vulgarity , meanness are the norm .

the truth is most people do n't have table manners today . and when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear , civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels .

it 's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice , they can be taught to humans .

heavens no . my work now is ... right now i 'm teaching mice ... well , table manners , to be candid .

i love that you said that . it makes me feel a bit lighter . i 've been rather heavy lately . thinking about my childhood . realizing how much a product i am of my upbringing . i 've been seeing someone . a therapist .

slugdom . sluggishness . whatever you 'd call it . i 'm not there yet . i still have many human characteristics .

they do n't seem to be especially ego driven , this is true .

they 're so even keel . they forge ahead with slow determination . they do n't get distracted or side-tracked . they do n't care what they look like . they do n't care that people look at them and go , `` ewww . a slug . ''

meditations on a banana slug was a delightful read .

i have to talk . is that okay ?

unn .

good . remember , when in doubt : do n't ever do what you really want to do .

oh , i will ! your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me . i do n't want to disappoint you .

it 's wonderful ! do you think i 'm ready ? do you really ?

even better .

extra dessert ?

and because you did so well , we have a little surprise for you .

did i ? i tried so hard ! i really concentrated ! oh , i 'm so happy !

yahoo !

i bow to your expertise in these matters .

now , puff , we 're leaving on the electronic collar . i do n't think we 'll need to shock you , but just in case .

yes .

mother ?

i saw you on c-span . i 've been looking for you for thirty years . then there you were , such a beautiful , beautiful grown man .

wait !

huh ?

check !

comin ' in or goin ' out ?

yep .

all i want 's the money .

that 's the way it 's done .

it 's what eddie wants . he , uh , told me to give you some money .

in a little while . that 's what you want , is n't it ?

thank you .

all right . today for me , tomorrow for himself .

do we need words ?

does n't your lighter work , mr. gordon ?

i know . been there myself . we 've all been there , have n't we , miss packard ?

what makes you know so much ? how do you know what eddie was thinking ?

how much do i owe you ?

that seems a shame . the night is young .

i did n't ask him can he beat you . i already know he can beat you . i asked him will he ? with eddie , that 's two different things .

you ever played billiards before ?

oh , we 'll start small ... a hundred dollars a game .

good , good .

we 'll be there .

well , mr. felson , maybe you could come out to my place some evening . we could play a few games of billiards .

boy , we really gave it to her good .

tell her what ?

i got time , bert .

i do n't believe you , eddie . i think you 're still a loser .

how 're the hands ?

what 's the difference ? you got a pool cue , balls on the table . all you got ta do is get the feel of it .

c'mon , bert . let me play him .

so does eddie .

nah . sit tight . he 'll be over here .

where ?

good . i 'd hate to think i was putting my money on a cripple .

no , no . when you play for me , i pick up all the tabs .

what 's that supposed to mean ?

i do n't . but i got confidence in findley .

you must have a lot of confidence in me .

i do n't know . never saw him play . they say he 's one of the best .

he 's a gentleman . gentleman gambler . he gets his kicks playing with hustlers . he 's got an old southern mansion with a pool table in the basement , drinks eight-year-old bourbon , smokes cork-tipped cigarettes .

hey , get us a couple of drinks here , will ya ? j. t. s. brown .

thinking about what ?

yeah . big creep . broke my thumbs .

oh . you seem to do all right that way .

now , when did you adopt me ?

i never saw you do anything else .

how much you think you 're worth these days ? i 'm puttin ' up the money , i 'm puttin ' up the time . for that i get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win .

that 's a -- that 's a pretty big slice . who do you think you are , general motors ?

for me .

for who ?

seventy-five per cent .

to do what ?

sure , you got drunk . that 's the best excuse in the world for losing . no trouble losing when you got a good excuse . and winning ! that can be heavy on your back too . like a monkey . you drop that load too when you got an excuse . all you got ta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself . it 's one of the best indoor sports : feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all , especially the born losers .

first time in ten years i ever saw minnesota fats hooked , really hooked . but you let him off .

what 's that supposed to mean ?

eddie , is it all right if i get personal ?

he drank as much whisky as you did .

i got drunk .

you 're damned right i 'm sure . everybody 's got talent . i got talent . you think you can play big-money straight pool , or poker , for forty straight hours on nothing but talent ? you think they call minnesota fats the best in the country just 'cause he 's got talent ? nah . minnesota fats 's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body .

what is ?

i lost twenty bucks .

yeah ? why ?

sit down .

okay ?

mister . you been sittin ' in that spot for hours . would you mind moving ? it bothers me .

just tell me where i can find him , friend .

who 's he ?

maybe . you want to play ?

what for ? to play fats again ?

c'mon , c'mon , just give me the money .

my twenty-five per cent . approximately fifteen hundred bucks .

do n't worry about it . i 'll raise the money .

with what ?

this boy 's crazy . they wiped the floor with him . they beat his brains out and he wants to go back . what for ? to take another beating ?

what kind of life have you got here ? scufflin ' around the small rooms , picking up eight , ten bucks a day ?

i want you to come back on the road with me .

oh , do n't play it small , charlie . it do n't look good on you .

hello , charlie ... c'mon in ... that 's my girl .

you do n't need a drink .

you ca n't see it , can you , charlie ? i mean , you 've never been able to see it . i came after him . and i 'm gon na get him . i 'm goin ' with him all the way . the pool game is not over until minnesota fats says it 's over . is it over , fats ?

get with what ?

now wait a minute . you 're coming with me . you 're gon na eat breakfast at the hotel . pool game is over .

eleven thousand four hundred , cash . here in my pocket .

you 're drunk , boy . i 'm not gon na bet ya any more .

luck ! whaddya mean , luck ?

yeah . you must come again .

oh no , nothing for me .

by all means .

what time ?

bert , i believe mr. felson 's making a proposition .

and i you . i think i 've heard about you , mr. felson . you play pocket billiards , do n't you ?

ten dollars .

half and a dollar .

hey , uh , mister ? hey , okay if i grab a cue ?

you better not miss , friend .

i guess it 's just you and me , huh ?

hi .

shut up .

just for luck .

why should i ?

leave now .

do n't you want to know where i 'm going ?

oh , i do n't know .

your tie . i never saw you wear one before .

two . sherry ? ... nice joint . you look very pretty .

sherry . very old , very dry .

does it bother you ? what he said ?

is he a winner ?

he 's a gambler .

yeah . i met this guy -- gordon , bert gordon . he said i was . born loser .

no . you ?

what happened ?

who is it ?

you 'll find yourself another rich old lover .

from a rich old man who used to be my lover .

no , why should i ? it 's yours .

when you 've got money , you 'll pay .

you know , i 've been living here for almost three years . now in three days it seems as if i know everybody . when i pass people on the street i want to stop and say , `` listen , i got a fella . ''

yeah , i went out for a couple of hours .

oh , i forgot .

well , what do you want to know ? and why ?

i 'm not sure ... i do n't know .

what did you say that for , sarah ?

come here .

give me a drag .

i drink .

i 've got nothing else to do on tuesdays and thursdays .

no , i did n't mean that -- whatever that means . i mean , you just do n't look young enough .

you do n't look like a college girl .

around .

it 's the lights . and the scotch .

can i sit down ?

thanks . i will .

have a nice trip .

well , you 're right . i guess it would n't .

yours .

i quit , eddie . i ca n't beat you . willie , give him the stakes . you got yourself a pool player .

i came to play pool , fats .

preacher ! go on down and get me some bourbon . j. t. s. brown . no ice , no glass .

boy , he is great ! jeez , that old fat man . look at the way he moves . like a dancer .

fats , let 's you and i shoot a game of straight pool .

now and then . you know how it is .

he wanted me to see -- he thinks i was -- infected by you .

do you still want me to stay ?

you want me to stay ?

that 's who you are too , emma .

we do n't know that --

what do you want ?

if i 'm a hunter it 's because you taught me to be !

you 're not them .

you want to kill them .

you want to find them .

yes .

was this -- `` beautiful ? '' before ?

with them ?

you lived like this once .

they are ... sinister . they want to kill me .

the more we plant , the more that 'll grow , and the happier --

well , it 's not supposed to be done anyway .

it 's never gon na be done . you love puttering out there too much .

you and that damned garden .

it was at diane 's party in malibu and i had just broken up with todd and i was loaded for bear , any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out . so you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do . that watch out , baby , here comes mr. smooth thing .

i remember the first time we met . do you remember that ?

you built things .

you got that right .

i was so scared .

it was so real , dad .

that 's a doozy of a dream , son .

what , jim , what ?

are you all right , dad ?

there 's cassius ...

this should be the heaviest shower of the year .

we 're going to be moving , son .

it 's his nightmare . he still has n't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill .

you did ? why ? where were you ? they said you left hours ago . we were worried .

where 's your car ?

that 's ed . ed works with the bell telephone switching division .

yes , mr. gardner .

mr. gardner , i do n't think this is the place to discuss this matter .

they did n't find any signs of life on the viking missions .

yes ... yes , but i 'm not sure what i saw anymore .

i know a way .

no one comes here after dark .

the state police .

maybe -- it landed in the bushes .

does it look to you like anything landed here ?

if we go and look and there 's nothing there , you 'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind .

why ?

why not ? moving is hard for anybody . was it hard for you to leave all your friends ?

no .

this is a new town for you . do you like it here ?

i 'll pack us a lunch . hamburgers . you always like that , do n't you .

mom . i got ta talk to you .

your father asked you a question .

what do you think he saw ? could it have been something from the air base ?

i know . but you have a full day of school tomorrow -- you , too .

all right . i 'll be right back .

what 's his family background ?

what 's the story on jimmy gardner ?

if we do , we 'll both die virgins . but at last we 'll be together .

we 're going with you . i mean , we 're going too .

penicillin . at least it will help keep his fever down .

did it work ?

thirty seconds ? is n't that cutting it a little too close ?

better be . you left me for him .

he 's not going to listen to me .

i ca n't leave . we have to tell this to the president .

what do you want me to do ?

fifty six minutes , forty five seconds .

he still gets air sick , huh ? in all of this i did n't get the chance to thank you two .

david thought i was having an affair , which i was n't .

then what ?

remember i told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction .

what happened ?

what 're you talking about ?

did you try to switch to transponder channels ?

what the hell is this ?

it was turned on . i was ignoring you . what 's the big emergency ?

what 'd i say ?

i 'm making a mess .

moishe , please , do n't talk .

you punched the president in the face ?

it 's perfect the line is busy ?

perfect , she 's using it .

and you 're going to educate them ? tell me something , you 're so smart how come you spent eight years at m.i.t . to become a cable repairman ?

that 's okay . you 're driving .

you want to borrow the car ? you do n't have a license .

dad , do n't start .

i do n't hear no fat lady .

we 're loose !

nice meeting you .

it 's not me . they 're overriding the system .

what 're you doing ?

i ca n't shake her free .

mr. president , just what do you think you 're doing ?

pilots , sir . we do n't have enough people to get them in the air .

we 've been collecting planes from all over but ...

the helicopter never arrived at nellis and there 's been no radio contact .

general grey , co-ordinate with atlantic command . tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can .

with their shields down it might be possible .

sir , i strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately .

organize a military escort to crystal mountain .

it 's ... slowing down , sir .

no sir . definitely not .

dick-weed !

you know , you 're not as charming as you think you are .

really ? you do n't mind ?

he 's doing a good job .

he was n't his father . i was kinda hoping he 'd want the job , though .

stevie ... i ca n't ...

do n't worry , big guy . i 'm sure she got out of here before it happened .

i should n't have left her .

stop it .

we 're leaving , do n't try and stop us .

it 's the wrong field , you idiot ! lucas ' farm is on the other side of town .

just what the hell do you think you 're doing ?

what the hell 's going on ?

so far these things have not become hostile . for the moment let 's assume they wo n't . connie , let 's issue statements advising people not to panic , to stay home and take cover .

but , mr. president ...

well , i guess you 'd like to see the big tamale ? follow me .

yes .

mr. president , a real pleasure . they do n't let us out much , you know .

the dog ! ? you are named after the dog ...

yes .

marcus brody , sir . and where is indy ?

it 's ... a leap of faith . oh , god .

i 'm going after dad .

the present city of iskenderun is built on its ruins . marcus -- you remember what the grail tablet said . `` across the desert and through the mountain to the canyon of the crescent moon . '' but where exactly ?

it 's dad 's grail diary . every clue he ever followed . every discovery he made . a complete record of his search for the holy grail . this is his whole life . why would he have sent this to me ?

i do n't know . but whatever it is , he 's in over his head !

well done , indy . very well done , indeed . this will find a place of honor in our spanish collection .

all my life !

it 's war .

what ?

marcus !

do n't worry . doctor schneider will be there to meet you .

how dare he ? !

do n't take that tone with me , my good man . now buttle off and tell baron brunwald that lord clarence macdonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries .

did n't i warn you not to trust anybody , doctor jones ?

you could be more right than you know .

my engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of ankara while excavating for copper . can you translate the inscription ?

i never expected to see you again .

what do you know about this place ?

no ?

you had it ? you did n't trust me !

the grail diary .

mine , too .

are you sure ?

the ark of the covenant .

the christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later .

lower me down .

find something ?

in that case , i permit you .

fraulein -- will you permit me ?

who ? attila the professor ? he was never giddy , even when he was a schoolboy !

penitent . penitent ...

`` only the penitent man will pass . only the penitent man will pass . ''

get out of there , dad !

you call this archaeology ?

what do you think you 're doing ? ! get down !

dad , are we hit ? !

fly ... yes . land ... no .

very well . i 'm here now .

dad , how can you ?

you left just when you were becoming interesting .

and do i detect a rebuke ?

i wrote them down in my diary so that i would n't have to remember .

oh , yes . but i found the clues that will safely take us through , in the chronicles of st. anselm .

my diary 's in berlin .

what about the boat ? we 're not going on the boat ?

... the solution presents itself .

i ought to tell you something .

my lucky charm .

she talks in her sleep .

you did ! !

they want my diary .

there were rats , dad .

well , what was left of him .

humpf -- so i was wrong this time . but by god , i was n't wrong when i mailed you my diary . you obviously got it .

no ! dad , get your stuff . we 've got to get out of here .

it is you junior !

junior !

no , dad . you listen to me --

then wait -- count to twenty .

out !

but , indy --

ah , they set out across the desert this afternoon . i believe they took mister brody with them .

ask yourself , why do you seek the cup of christ ? is it for his glory , or for yours ?

the secret of the grail has been safe for a thousand years . and for all that time the brotherhood of the cruciform sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe .

who are you ?

if you let me go , i will tell you where he is .

then we 'll die .

if you do n't let go , doctor jones , we 'll both die .

where is he ? talk -- or you 're dead . damn it , tell me ! tell me !

i 'm sure that will please the maharajah , captain .

of course . the thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped kali with human sacrifices . the british army wiped them out about the time of the mutiny of 1857 .

dr. jones , you know very well that the thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century .

you 're hanging on better here than you did in america .

charming .

it 's some kind of cult ! and they 've got the sacred stones that indy was searching for .

jones is n't in his room . miss scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to delhi --

i 'm afraid they 'll kill them ! we saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man 's heart out !

listen , mr. lal , what do you call the maharajah 's wife ?

oh -- good . and maybe the present maharajah is a little younger ? and thinner ?

and did n't the sultan of madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country ?

i was dubious myself at first . then something connected -- the village 's rock and the old legend of the sankara stones ...

there , you see , captain . a rock !

at last i have the ashes of my sacred ancestor !

now what about the antidote , lao .

what 's that ?

next time i 'll cut off more than his finger .

so , it is true , dr. jones ? you found nurhachi ?

i do n't like to show off .

read you loud and clear , indy !

slow on the curves or we 'll fly off the tracks !

why ?

the village knew their rock was magic -- but they did n't know it was one of the lost sankara stones ...

okay , shorty ... see you in the morning ... i 'm going to have a little -- word with willie .

he was afraid of you . he knows a tough guy when he sees one .

indy , they glow like fire and get real crazy ! then he talk in this real scary voice !

next time i flatten him ! did you see his eyes ?

okey-doke , indy ! hold onto your potatoes !

step on it , short round !

wow ! holy smoke ! crash landing !

you 're betrayed shiva .

give me the stones !

no . they are here -- somewhere . a century ago when the british raided this temple and butchered my people , a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs .

i 'm sorry , i do n't know how i can help you here .

and it had three lines painted across it ? the lines represent the three levels of the universe . i 've seen stones like the one you lost .

what evil ?

you did n't do so well yourself . finding that stone could 've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about .

let her go ! our only chance is outrunning them !

go !

what 're we going to do ? !

you know you 've been nothing but trouble since i hooked up with you -- but i have to admit i 'd miss you if i lost you ...

yes , they believe you .

i do n't blame you ... this has n't been what you 'd call a fun vacation ...

i 'm not leaving without those stones .

it 's a thuggee ceremony . they 're worshipping kali , the goddess of death and destruction .

willie ? !

willie , come here ! hurry up , we 're in trouble ! !

dr. jones ?

do n't catch cold .

yeah -- and nothing else . that shock you ?

not leftovers ?

i 've always had a weakness for folk dancing .

any more complaints ?

he said he could n't take us any farther . he has to go sell the elephants .

he 's afraid of something .

what does the writing say ?

oh , that 's easy -- i 'm going to latch onto a good-looking , incredibly rich prince .

by the way , how 'd you end up in shanghai ?

yes , stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae .

do n't let it curl around you !

do n't let it pull you deeper !

what ? !

it 's a sacred stone in a shine that 's supposed to protect a village .

dream -- nightmare is more like it .

the old man saw it in a dream .

what 'd he say ?

india ...

i 'm freezing . what do you mean , tag along ? from the minute you walked into that nightclub , you have n't been able to keep your eyes off me .

since i was nice enough to let you tag along , why do n't you give your mouth a rest ? okay , doll ?

what 're we going to do ? ! where 're we going ? !

you do n't look very good .

look out , damn it , i need that antidote !

hey , he 's not a waiter ...

give me your hat ...

in a way , we 're like brothers ... i ca n't have her . i want you to .

you 're a lucky man .

i know it 's no good . i 've no right to be jealous .

you 've changed your mind .

i have been ... i think you 're right .

losing power . the laser drained it .

what happened ?

this may hurt .

and do n't let her know , either .

there 's a lot you do n't know .

he aready made the deal..

do n't worry , i can .

and dieter ?

he hung us up dry .

well at least talk it up , then . i feel like an idiot .

come on .

i need a guide and you need a client ... and $ 1000 .

door to the right . get up and run .

too late .

one of your instincts ?

you think . that 's what you 're good at .

what are you doing ? wait a minute . lets think this through .

` joe . i 'm here . you 're okay .

down to your heart . i 'm gon na clean some fat out before you drop on me .

just stay here and rest .

i ca n't keep up .

run , stupid !

follow her .

we are trying to stand out . right near his address . easier to get them to come to us , than to try and find them . ..now keep your eyes open , something might present itself .

osaka ?

why do n't you get out of my face .

some agent you are .

it was n't like that .

i ... i 'll got to the movies . that 's what i 'll do !

no . what do you hope ? al i hope . i just hope . that someday , you 're real small , and you 've got no time . and you got no one to help you . and you depend on me . and you know what i 'll do ?

ahhh ... works ... ryuji ... travel ... just business ... she's.. fine arts , university of tokyo..

what she say . what 'd you get out of her ?

i mean it . you watch old tapes of the ballgame , i 'll fill you in ... later . i mean it .

i 'll be right here . i 'll keep it in mind . i 'll get a lot more from her without you butting in .

it 's embarrassing .

maybe she 's telling the truth .

she 's the toughest to read .

voice stress analyzer .

he recognises you , throw him off .

it lends you an air of mystery .

the drinks ... stay on them .

who are they ? stay on them , will you . how can we find out ... wait . the glasses .

you got a better idea , you tell me . other than her , there 's no one here i know .

you want sophistication , it do n't come cheap .

it was a good job . not many ways for a foreigner to make money here . ryuji hires me to organize business meetings ... take care of things .

the most important one . can you help me find him ?

i 'm just on vacation .

i 'm sorry . what will you do ?

this business is over .

no , he did n't do that .

were you working for him last night ?

why did they leave ?

and you , what do you like ?

how often they come here ?

is that ryuji ?

... ummm , you really work for the foreign service ?

that was then . this is now . who am i talking to ?

you did .

but i do n't listen ... then i 'd be crazy .

you mean from it .

wait . what 's your name ?

let you leave without it .

do what ?

i ca n't do that ?

and you .

... blake

... i 'm looking for someone .

what do you do about what ?

water fountain 's through that door , down the hall .

is there anything else ?

i 'm sorry . we 're running behind . so many applicants ... so few jobs ... if you 'll just have a seat .

leaving , now go to sleep . ... all of you .

ahhh ... okay ? ! ! !

it will be fine . you have another .

no ?

it does n't hurt .

ow ? ...

what does he know ?

poor bastard .

in the backyard .

i 'll take some .

she was playing with the pooh doll .

yeah .

you better take a good look ! because i 'm getting two things : pissed off and curious ! now , any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire ? either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs ? like , for instance , their ex-supervisor , who 's already at brown & williamson as we fucking speak ?

let me tell you something , lowell . look , look , look . you 're talking about two agents in a regional office in louisville . i got the goddamn unabomber threatening to blow up lax ! i got ta move 45 agents from all over the country into l.a. alright ? when i get a chance , i 'll give it a look ...

yeah . catch you later .

are you all right ?

and it 's bullshit . and if i 'm right , are you going to put the journal 's reputation behind a story that 's going to blow up in your face ?

well , it 's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented .

it 's drawn from a selectively circulated ...

i 'll be there .

the sub-heading is , `` brown & williamson has a 500-page dossier attacking chief critic . '' it quotes richard scruggs calling it `` the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower . ''

good .

oh , we need cops on the street . we do n't need them on horses .

shit ...

okay .

i 'm cooking pasta primavera .

can i go to dance tomorrow ? i 'm better ...

no , you fucked you ! do n't invert stuff ! big tobacco tried to smear wigand ; you bought it . the wall street journal , here , not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment , refutes big tobacco 's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination ! and now , even now , when every word of what wigand has said on our show is printed , the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the state of mississippi , the cat totally out of the bag , you 're still standing here debating ! don , what the hell else ... do you need ?

no . i should have . i told them i disagreed with you , mike and kluster that this segment is as good as the original . i 'm not lying for you . i 'm not gon na shut up for you . not on any of it .

i 'm staying right here . doing my job . fighting to get my show on the air . you do n't like it ? hey , i 'll tell you what ... fire my ass ...

then what are you going to do ?

no . i 'm not going to take `` no '' for an answer . no .

i am ? you pay me to go get guys like wigand , to draw him out . to get him to trust us , to get him to go on television . i do . i deliver him . he sits . he talks . he violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement . and he 's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue , maybe the biggest , most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in u.s. history . and jeffrey wigand , who 's out on a limb , does he go on television and tell the truth ? yes . is it newsworthy ? yes . are we gon na air it ? of course not . why ? because he 's not telling the truth ? no . because he is telling the truth . that 's why we 're not going to air it . and the more truth he tells , the worse it gets !

are you suggesting that she and eric are influenced by money ?

it 's not a rumor . it 's a sale . if tisch can unload cbs for $ 81 a share to westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from brown & williamson , that could screw up the sale , could it not ?

yeah , they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of `` kools '' to the world . `` sealed '' does n't hurt scruggs ' litigation , and since we 're the only ones with the story , i believe we 're sitting on an exclusive .

i 'm not implying . i 'm quoting . more vested interests ... `` persons who will profit from this merger ... ms. helen caperelli , general counsel of cbs news , 3.9 million . mr. eric kluster , president of cbs news , 1.4 million ... ''

before you go ...

that 's happening . and , hopefully we wo n't have to use the alternate , but we should have it in the can .

yes , i do . a .38 target master . in my gun safe downstairs . a .45 gold cup . a .22 target pistol . so what ?

if we could take a look , mr. wigand ...

what caliber is my gun ?

did you handle the round , mr. wigand ?

i 'm gon na do a follow-up .

mike ... mike ... mike ...

well , at the end of the day ... because of your segment ... the brown & williamson tobacco company ... could own cbs .

you 're getting ahead of yourself . we 're all in this together . we 're all cbs . we 'll find out soon . thank you , gentlemen .

come again ?

and , i 'm told there are questions as to our `` star witness ' '' veracity .

well , until you do , all i can tell you is what you already know ... they will not air an interview .

oh , c'mon , lowell . this is the new york times . i do n't know ...

no . i 'm assuming the cave-in begins with the threat of litigation from big tobacco . are we talking ... are we talking brown & williamson , here ?

lowell ?

you ready ... ?

... taping ? what are you taping ?

i told him that you had an e-mail death threat that said if you did n't shut the `` f '' up , they were going to kill you ...

what 's going on ?

no , thank you .

there 's a severance agreement ... it includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage ... sure you do n't need anything ?

thomas sandefur ...

that 's my stuff from the office ...

uh , what are those boxes ?

yes , it 's on the stove ...

i can take her .

yeah .

`` 60 minutes '' ?

get some perspective , lowell .

what are you and mike going to do ?

what ? !

they 're killing the wigand interview ...

it 's stuart ... he 's in mexico city ...

no . no , it 's okay ... how 's -- how 's the new place ?

... and i 'd be lying to you if i did n't tell you , i 'm about out of moves , dick ...

yeah .

it would be better if he called us .

well , actually , no . well , he 's on the fence . that 's the point .

what 's your interest in this , mr. bergman ?

... you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the state of mississippi , did you not ?

area code 212-555-0199 .

i did ? what do i tell a source on the next tough story ? hang in with us . you 'll be fine ... maybe ?

oh , please , mike ...

yeah , that 's right .

alright . what did you think ?

i disappeared on you ?

do me a favor , will you ? spare me , for god 's sake . get in the real world . what do you think ? i 'm going to resign in protest ? to force it on the air ? the answer is `` no . '' i do n't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of national public radio . that decision i 've already made .

`` put the corporation at risk '' ... ? give me a fucking break !

do you think we could talk about the taping ? tomorrow 's taping , just so we can get it out of the way and order ...

thank you for saying that ...

the seven ceos of big tobacco ... referred to this ... said they should be afraid of him ... i assume , afraid of what he could reveal . now , you tell me . what does this guy have to say that threatens these people ?

yeah .

you eating with us ?

coffee ?

i greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes . i helped him to say yes . alright . you 're not a robot , jeff ! that 's all . you got a mind of your own , do n't you ?

that 's bullshit , jeff !

what does this have to do with my testimony ? ! i told the truth ! it 's valid and true and provable !

that 's the whole point , jeffrey . that 's the whole point . anyone 's . everyone 's . they are gon na look under every rock , dig up every flaw , every mistake you 've ever made . they are going to distort and exaggerate everything you 've ever done , man . do n't you understand ?

alright ... the abc telemarketing company ?

... i was young . i was young ... confused ... we did n't handle it the right way ...

oh , you know what we do or do not need to know ? since when have you become a media expert ?

i do n't know how to say this , jeff , except to just say it right out , so i 'll say it . they do not want to air it .

`` part of the reason i 'm here is i felt that their representation clearly , at least within ... ''

i heard .

... they `` volunteered . '' a friend owns a large security company .

excuse me . yeah ...

i have to put my family 's welfare on the line here , my friend ! and what are you puttin ' up ? you 're puttin ' up words !

are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here ? ! i never abandoned a source !

you believe that because you get information out to people ... something happens ?

you believe that ?

i 'm just a commodity to you , are n't i ? i could be anything . right ? anything worth putting on between commercials ...

i 'm not pushing you around ! i 'm asking you questions .

why ?

you charge by the hour ?

is that why you became a journalist ? then you get to ask all the questions ?

next to your father ?

marcuse . yeah . he was my mentor . he had a major influence on the new left in the late '60s ... and on me , personally .

yeah ... look , thanks for talking . i 'm sorry i woke you up .

it 's obvious , is n't it ?

good . you have kids ?

... and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction , disease ...

the seven ceos of big tobacco ... they got up in front of congress that time ... it was on television ...

like where 'd you work before brown & williamson ?

they should be .

no . i did not . big tobacco is a big story . and you got something important to say . i can tell . but , yes . i did . i came all the way down here to tell you : story , no story , fuck your story , i do n't burn people .

how the hell do i know about brown & williamson ?

why am i gon na mention your name ?

to straighten something out with you . right here . right now .

this is my house ... in front of my wife , my kids ? ! what business do we have ?

i did not burn you . i did not give you up to anyone !

what do ...

what are you talking about ? where are you ?

did work .

did work .

... but that 's as far as i go ...

just so i know you know , when i talk to people in confidence , it stays that way .

who 's that ?

he does n't seem to be listening ...

no , no . do n't call the police ! just tell him i 'm on the phone with you ... my name is lowell bergman ... just tell him that .

i think i need to call the police . he wo n't respond ...

and , so , i moved out ... i see the girls a couple of days a week ...

what do you mean there is no family ?

jeffrey , how are you ? how 's the family , okay ?

hold on a minute , lowell ... ... somebody ... may be following me . i do n't know . they came on the property ...

we have a couple . one 's hers , one 's mine . everybody uses a different name . modern marriage . how 's liane ?

`` there are times ... i wish i had n't done it . but there are times that i feel compelled to do it ... '' `` i 've -- if you asked me if i would do it again or if it 's -- do i think it 's worth it . yeah . i think it 's worth it . ''

how does one ... `` go ... to ... jail ? '' what does my family do ? go on welfare ? if my wife has to work ? who 's going to look after the kids ? put food on the table ? my children need me . if i 'm not teaching ... there 's no medical ... no medical ... even on co- pay , that 's like ... tuition ...

possibly , yes . that is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today . that 's right ...

hello .

okay . i do n't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements . i was paid well for my work . the health and welfare benefits are good . the severance package is fair . i have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which i said i would n't .

... we worked together for , what was it , three years ... ? now , the work we did here is confidential , not for public scrutiny ... any more than are one 's family matters ...

jeff 's a premiere golfer ... what are you , a two handicap ?

please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm , trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --

you did good , massey !

howard !

baby . you are so hot !

-- we realized we 'd always been very attracted to one another .

miles , i know you 're busy and that you charge by the hour so i 'll come to the point . howard and i are planning to marry .

i 'd just like to have a word with her .

-- understand what you 're asking for here . the massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason , both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in , and earned during . no one can profit from the marriage . the pre-nup protects the wealthier party .

i just want to make sure that you both --

i ... uh guess congratulations are in order .

yep . my divorce just came through . shoulda called you . coulda cut a better deal ! my wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children . but , i do n't know . guess i 'm just a softie . after all amanda and me were together for -- what -- you 'd know better than me , marylin . she was your best friend .

so she 's uh , flourishing ?

and how is mrs. reiser ?

after you , doll .

oh . right . wo n't you have a seat ?

here 's her picture ...

who do you want me to kill ?

who 's the pigeon ?

i am here representing mr. dumbarton , on a ... matter of some delicacy .

lem me tell you something . you are the pestilence . i 'm the exterminator .

we rest , your honor .

marylin ! what have i done ?

she 's rich . we 're still married . we have no pre-nup .

i 'm sorry to hear that . but you were n't close , were you ?

yes ?

that was marvin untermeyer .

oh . i thought maybe -- gee !

he 's the wrong man .

got any symptoms ?

you were going to be a cardiac surgeon . i was going to clerk for the supreme court .

it was a gift from a client .

it 's a lecoultre revers . you can flip the face , and set it for two time zones .

no frown lines . new watch ?

it 's a form of botulism . i just inject it into your forehead , and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you ca n't raise them ...

she got absolutely nothing . zero . zip .

i 'll be right back .

it sounded like a bell .

oh boy . if he only knew .

i think ming is older than tong . what is this ?

you 're vulnerable .

fine . they were created during a dictatorship . what if something happened to you ? what would i tell little gus when he asked `` what was my daddy like ? ''

pre-castro .

your forgetting rex rexroth ?

that 's marriage .

drop the bogus forgery charge and i 'll forget about your generous friends slash clients .

did our marriage ever mean anything to you ?

i believe the residence will be part of the settlement .

i know . so am i , right ? and so is agent wilson of the internal revenue service . he 's a dedicated , underpaid graduate of southwestern university -- very tenacious , and never more so than when he 's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague . i think it 's only fair to warn you : i 'm going to file an action , miles . and after a decent interval i plan to have ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house .

salary . unreported income . by the way , what time is it on bellagio road ?

those are gifts .

what kind of `` stuff ? ''

what do you want ?

on the contrary . we 're married and we have no pre-nup , so a case could be made that everything in here is mine .

miles ? you 're scaring me .

can you marylin ? can you return the trust ? can you return the hopes ? the dreams ? can you just ... send it all back for store credit ?

what 's wrong miles ? did i spend too much ?

good . are those foods ?

here 's my card . spend as much as you want . we get mileage .

yes . short notice you know , but i think there 's nice closure to it . hello judge muson . a pleasure as always .

was n't she the judge at my divorce hearing ?

oh right . you met patricia .

your mother was .

and here i thought my mother was ...

hmmm ...

you have wonderful art . i love that lithograph . hockney ?

i 'm on sunset . near the beverly hills hotel . wan na meet me for a drink in the polo ... ?

you should n't be driving . where are you ?

i am thrilled for you , but tell me this ... how 'd you get howard to do it ? i 've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion , but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea .

miles . miles . miles .

howard is a beautiful person .

but why him ?

absolutely .

and you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him ?

and you 've always loved him ?

he wants a reconciliation .

why would you be here ?

how nice .

are you alright ? you lost weight .

rex . go away . i do n't want to have to sic the dogs on you .

rex . get away from the door .

now ? well , marylin , now you cut a deal or find out how jean harris made it work for her .

so . now what ?

do you think he set me up ? do you think that was his intention ?

quite a little shopping spree . how do you spend six figures in less than six hours ? oh , never mind i 've seen it before . i 've seen everything .

please !

but you 're going through with it ?

what about rugs ? i thought we were stopping at mansour ?

it 's not ming . it 's tong .

hello miles .

you 're not ...

probably . every woman in my life was divorced at least twice . what was i supposed to say . anthropologist ?

they bought her speech . if i was only in it for rex 's money , he should n't have to give me any .

get this ! he called and invited me to dinner .

anyway , even rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence . if i did n't know better , i 'd swear massey had some personal investment in my ruination .

i 'm dying .

every week --

oh , god !

who 's she ?

by reputation . he got ann rumsey that cute little island of george 's .

of massey myerson ?

miles massey .

she 's a legend . did n't she do kravis or a pearlman ? she definitely did a factor .

i did n't know barry had a beach house .

yes , i know howard doyle .

excuse me ?

we 've outlined a settlement ...

... why did she do it , ruth ? why ?

are you familiar with kirshner ?

why only fifty percent , ruth ? why not ask for a hundred percent ?

-- so much for the icebreakers . what 're you after , ruth ?

heh heh .

ha ha .

that 's delusional .

a yert . ruth is a living legend , rex . at a time when most women are in boca , having early bird specials -- she 's working so her husband can be in montana . in a yert .

she always looked out for me .

i think that went as well as could be expected .

please -- let me handle this . okay , ruth , forget kirshner -- what 's your bottom line ?

you know what i mean when i say `` it . ''

time marches on . ardor cools .

thank you .

rex , please .

should we counsel fear -- or trust ? should we seek to destroy -- or to build ? should we meet our clients ' problems with cynicism -- or with love ?

yes . it 's for your protection , sweetheart . you 're the one with the -- the ...

the judge is here . over here , judge munson .

we wanted ruth here for your protection as well --

i tried to reach ruth , but we could n't get her .

kenneth this is my associate , wrigley . wrigley this is my friend , dr. beck .

she owes me a meal .

she deserves every penny . they pay great athletes a fortune . well , marylin rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power .

ah , but is she richer than mrs. croesus ?

... and i hear she 's richer than croesus .

i ca n't help it . even with the business we 're in , i -- it gets me every time . it 's so -- optimistic .

wrigley !

wait ... he wants to give her ... ?

i see . and what were you going to tell us about patty slash marylin ?

who 's `` patty . ''

no . uh uh . i do n't think so . hmm ? no . well ... no .

no . i have n't . but i 've been out of town . hello , rex . hello there .

hard to believe i know . i 'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters .

mother ?

thorstenson gieselensen . he just separated from his third . he 's in fish . he is fish .

ramona ! do n't get mia farrow on us .

i 've been trying to nail george 's for years , but he 's very careful . i 'll just keep having children . i think i 'm pregnant , by the way .

what 's the matter ? anything wrong ?

ohmary

i asked you a question . do you love her ?

a guy that 'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined .

listen , did anybody ever make a sucker out of you ? this is a matter of principle . something you probably would n't understand . when somebody takes me for a buggy ride i do n't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege .

yeah .

nono . what the deuce do i want to

looks like that was his only interest in me . the reward .

why ? do you know him ?

no , i 'll go through with it .

it 's no use , dad . i practically threw myself at him .

i do n't know .

oh , come now

i do n't know very much about him . except that i love him .

i have n't seen you cry since you were a baby . this must be serious . where 'd you meet him ?

yes . personally , i think it 's silly , too .

stunt ?

i knocked several times .

oh , hello , dad .

i 'll shout to my heart 's content ! i 'll scream if i want to .

you 're going to finance him , i suppose .

i 'll get it annulled .

know what my next move is ? no more cigarettes .

might have been able to help if it were n't for you . i 've been watched so closely , i

holy smoke ! i forgot all about that . send a wireless at once , `` lovington detective agency . daughter escaped again . watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in miami . have your new york office keep tabs on king westley . intercept all messages . want her back at all costs ! ''

absurd ! all this fuss over a snip of a girl . i 'm going down to see her myself .

she has n't had a thing yesterdayor today .

yes , of course .

oh , no . she 'll be crazy about it . well , see you later . i 'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space . goodbye .

you 've got a good thing and you 're hanging on to it , huh ? all right , you win . i 'll just have to get used to you . i admit i 'm licked . but only because i 'm worried . i 've had detectives all over the country searching for her . i 've seen thousands of photographs . fortune tellers , nuts , every crank in the country has written me . have n't slept one night this week . if i do n't find her , i 'll go crazy .

`` what 's holding up the annulment , you slow poke ? the walls of jericho are toppling . '' send him a telegram right away . just say : `` let 'em topple . ''

here 's another wire , sir . this one 's from charleston . `` checking every northbound train . also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways . no success yet . will continue to do everything possible . '' signed : lovington detective agency , charleston .

me ? forget it , son . i got millions .

hey , hey , are n't you afraid you 'll burn out a tonsil ?

holy smokes ! you 'll never get out yourself ! better phone for some help .

hey , whadda you tryin ' to dokid me ?

ohthe papers

what do you think you 're doing !

just between you and me , i never intended taking it off .

okay ! okay ! keep your shirt on , young feller .

congratulations .

yes . have n't you thought about it at all ? seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy .

yeah , swell .

darling !

a black eye .

what 'd you give him for the car ?

what happened ?

oh , you 've been hurt ! there 's a cut on

oh , peter ! what happened ? are you all right ?

we do n't need forty cars .

hm ? yeah , but it 's no good if you have n't got a long face with it .

oh , no !

you 're an expert , i suppose .

what if nobody stops for us ?

raw ?

if it 's just the same to you , we 'll sit right here till they come . got a toothpick ?

does n't sound very exciting .

was so scaredthat it scared

what 's got into you ?

oh , peter

what !

i 'll get my clothes all wrinkled .

holy smokes ! why did i ever get mixed up with you !

all right . you win . let 's forget it .

i do n't know about you , but i 'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it .

you 're prejudiced .

yes .

never ! i 'll get to new york if i have to starve all the way .

what do you meanstarvation ?

okay with me , if you can stand the starvation diet .

first town we hit in the morning , you better wire your father .

i do n't trust that chatterbox .

what 's the matter ?

yes , i noticed he was getting a little fat lately . ouch !

poor old shapeley . you should n't have frightened him like that .

do n't be silly . nothing you can do . must be tough on an old womana trip like this .

oh , you are ! who made you the manager ?

no mushy stuff . i 'm running this troupe .

how about cinderellaor a real hot love story ?

aw , nuts ! you 're just like your old man ! once a plumber always a plumber ! there is n't an ounce of brains in your whole family !

there you go again ! how many times did i tell you to stop butting in when i have an argument ?

what are you talking about ?

of course you should n't . you do n't know how to do it . dunking 's an art . do n't let it soak so long . a dip and plop , into your mouth . if you let it soak so long , it 'll get soft and fall off . it 's all a matter of timing . i ought to write a book about it .

um-hm . we rode around all afternoon . father was frantic . by 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged .

santa claus ?

just shows you how wrong a guy can be . doughnut ?

where 'd you say the showersand thingswere ?

heretake mine .

like this . i have no robe .

come on ! hurry up ! breakfast 'll be ready in no time .

the pleasure is all mine .

oh , i forgot to tell you . i registered as mr. and mrs .

yeah . yeah , it 's a gift .

darn clever , these armenians .

are you talking to me !

now , just a minuteyou ca n't

you have your nerve ! here , boy !

what for ?

quit kidding ! it 's all over the front pages , you know , i 've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry king westley .

you 'll never get away with it , miss andrews . your father 'll stop you before you get half way to new york .

will you please tell me what you 're raving about !

what are you talking about ?

i found it on the seat .

that was foolish of me . why did n't you shove me away ?

why , you ungrateful brat !

no . i 'd rather you did n't .

no , i 've got that , all right . but my money . all i have here is four dollars . i 've got to get to new york with it .

what happened ?

i do n't know what you 're raving about , young man . and , furthermore , i 'm not interested .

tell that man not to drive so fast .

i beg your pardon !

yep ! the walls of jericho .

comical part of it is , it is n't what you want at all . in a couple of weeks you 'll be looking for the nearest exit . . . people like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round . i guess that 's what makes you so dizzy . you 're always chasing after something . at least you think you are . truth is , you 're just running away . from yourself , mostly . 'cause you 're miserable . you hate yourself . the world 's full of people like you . do n't know what they want .

you ca n't be hungry and scared at the same time .

onetwothreefourfive

hey , wait a minute ! let 's get something straightened out right now . if you 've any peculiar ideas that i 'm interested in you , forget it . you 're just a headline to me .

compared to you , my friend , shapeley 's an amateur . whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this ! you 're positively the most conceited

sorry , miss .

eight o'clock tonight .

in about fifteen minutes .

oh , thank you . thank you .

yeah ? what makes you think so ! he took his suitcase and everything . kinda surprised , huh ? it 's just like i told you , zeke . they ai n't married a'tall . . .

what 's the matter ? where 's your husband , young lady

sorryi did n't mean to

just your imagination .

eight o'clock .

yes ?

do you mind taking those things off the walls of jericho ? it 's tough enough as it is .

yeah .

what 's up ?

do n't accept any more .

yes .

here 's another wire from peter warne .

did you know he reversed the charges on that call ?

would n't have made a bad story , would it ?

yeah . sure . had me going for a while .

who 's the guy she 's gon na marry ?

it 's all right here . give me the thousand and it 's yours .

who 's she gon na marry ?

you mean about the andrews ' kid ?

when you get through with that , i 'll have a beard down to my ankles .

i ai n't got a hat .

yeah .

collect .

send it collect .

go on . go on send the telegram .

i 'm just fine thanks , and how are you ? to `` joe gordon , care of new york mail , new york . am i laughing . the biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap . i know where ellen andrews is '' no , do you really ?

you send telegrams here ?

yeah .

looks like it , do n't it ? here 's the woman , ma .

see that . they 're gone !

oh , thanks , thanks , mister . i always knew you guys were kind-hearted .

okay . just remember that . now beat it .

no .

yeah . just babies .

you 're not making any mistake , believe you me .

lucky thing , my running into you . just the man i need .

you 're a pretty shrewd baby . we better get away from this gang . talk this thing over privately .

five g'sor i crab the works .

yeahwould n't it ?

looks like we 're going to be stuck for a long time .

oh , excuse me . i was just tryin'you knowto make things pleasant .

what 's the idea ?

well , what do you expect from a pig but a grunt .

when you 're in a war , boss , you use every weapon you got .

i do n't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo , numa , it 's none of our business . let 's keep this side of it quiet , shall we ?

the interesting thing is the extent to which the warren commission went to make him a communist . they got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this mexico trip and the picture does n't even match . i 'm beginning to think the point of the mexican episode was to lay the blame at castro 's door . if oswald , or someone purporting to be oswald , had gotten into cuba , come back , then killed the president , the american public once again would 've screamed for a cuban invasion ...

boss , oswald impersonators ? sounds like james bond now .

so you saw oswald how many times ?

you knew you were n't talking to some low life fag , you know . he had command of the king 's english .

you tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this `` clay bertrand '' and asked to fly to dallas and be lee oswald 's layer .

there you go . grain of salt . two sides to every coin .

you know what i mean . i saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer . and a lotta strange people .

who 'd ever thought that goofy oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination ? just goes to show , you can never know about some people . am i right , jack ? well , bless my soul . your eyes are as red as two cherries , jack . do n't tell me we have another bleeding heart here . hell , all these years i thought you were on my side .

boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew ...

... rumor is shaw , a local boy , was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement . no one really knows what they were doing there , but everyone sure saw 'em . they stood out like cottonballs . i got whites and blacks saw 'em , but last time i checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote . we still got the negro junkie , vernon bundy , saw 'em talkin ' at the seawall near lake pontchartrain . but it 's tough , boss - no one wants to talk about shaw . he 's ...

the fact is he 's gone , chief , and so 's our case .

pretty flowery for dave ferrie .

so why does he call himself bertrand ?

shaw . clay shaw .

what 's the other name ?

... there were about nine or ten people , cubans , friends of dave doing some stuff in the bush with him . place was a mess . dave 's mind was a mess , y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he 's working on this cure for cancer ... dave 's smart - real smart - speaks five languages , knows philosophy , medicine , military history , politics . he wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer ...

i do n't know , bill , i just do n't know .

jesus , they must 've been hard pressed to come up with that one .

can you get some sworn statements ?

when something 's rotten in the land , bill , it generally is n't just one fish , we 'll get corroboration ... find this clay bertrand . if i were a betting man , i 'd give you 10 to 1 it 's an alias . start checking around the quarter .

at 7:30 sunday morning ? it 's not exactly fresh blood we 're sniffing here , boss .

not in a routine autopsy , but if we looked at the spinal fluid , there might be a high level of iodine , but it 's difficult to know . whatcha thinkin ' , jim ?

he 'd die pretty quick , either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain .

no , i would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures i 've been shown .

i do n't have much time . they do n't even need bugs anymore . they got these fuckin ' satellite waves . they put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born , right up his nostrils , subcutaneous , between his eyes . he was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment . a nazi rocket scientist father and a commie spy mother . you 'd never believe half the shit the agency does . i 'm so fuckin ' tired . have n't slept since that shit article came out . why 'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this ?

i do n't know who to trust anymore . yeah , sure i could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of camels . you got anything new in the investigation ?

listen , dave , why do n't we order some room service , have a bite , relax . i 'll stay as long as you want .

i got no place to sleep . i 'll meet you in 20 minutes .

yeah ! he 'd kill for you dave . he likes you . your mind .

what are you talking about , dave ? you were n't mentioned in the story . do n't jump to conclusions .

calm down , dave , what ?

yeah , you got it . since you 're the only straight shooter in that fuckin ' office , i 'd like an answer from you . did you plant it ?

dave ?

then who killed the president ?

what about ruby ?

did you take a good look at the tv when they had oswald ?

you mean about the cubans getting trained north of the lake ?

i see . dave thank you for your time . i 'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you , but i 'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the fbi .

yes , now i remember , mr. garrison . i 'm sorry , i got confused . we got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we 'd forgotten our shotguns . stupid , right ? so of course we did n't get any geese .

your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car . dave , is n't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun ?

oh yes , well , come to think of it , they 're right . we got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them . but you could n't approach them . they were a wise bunch of birds .

i believe the boys got a couple .

i see . and where did you drive ?

do you mind if i smoke , mr. garrison ?

colonel finck , are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck ?

i ca n't believe you 're saying this in the courtroom .

if that 's your case , you did n't have a case . i would n't believe whatever habighorst said , anyway .

that 's our case !

daddy ! where have you been ?

a rhinoceros . can i stay up another hour ?

dad , look what i drew .

daddy said it was all right if i was real quiet .

... you heard echoes .

look , do you want the truth , or just what you want me to say ?

no , you do n't !

no , i saw a guy shooting from over there . he was behind that fence . what are you going to do about it ?

that 's impossible . you heard echoes ... echoes . we have three bullets and three shots which came from the book depository and that 's all we 're willing to say .

i do n't believe it !

the oswalds are introduced by george de mohrenschildt to janet and bill williams . it 's through janet williams in october '63 that lee gets the warehouse job , right smack on elm street at the book depository , which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence .

equally incongruous is oswald becoming chummy with the white russian community of dallas - all rabid anti- communists .

the next thing we know he 's living in dallas/ft . worth in october '62 working 6 months at jaggars-chiles- stovall , a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the u.s. army ... he starts work only days before the government reveals russian missiles in cuba and the crisis explodes . oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the u2 planes and works alongside a young man who 'd been in the army security agency .

and marina ? does she have a problem getting out ?

spas t. raikin , a leading member of an anti-communist group .

the fbi finally gets around to talking to him in dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant communist type .

negative on his tax records . classified . first time i know a d.a . ca n't get a tax record . i put together a list of all the cia files on oswald that were part of the warren report and asked for them . there are about 1200 documents ... oswald in the ussr , in mexico city , oswald and the u2 , a cia 201 personnel file , a memo from the director on oswald , travel and activities - ca n't get one of them . all classified as secret on the grounds of national security . it 's real strange .

now just a minute , sir ! you 're way out of line !

i 've spent half my life in the united states military serving and defending this great country , mr. shaw , and you 're the first person i ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president .

may i go ? regardless of what you may think of me , mr. garrison , i am a patriot first and foremost .

... and that this company is linked to the schlumber tool company here in houma , louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to david ferrie and his cubans ...

i 'm well aware of this asinine article . and i am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper .

one meets so many attorneys in my business . no , i do n't believe i know dean andrews .

no . i have never known anyone by that name . of course never having met mr. o'keefe i could hardly have met mr. ferrie ...

... in the course of that night , mr. o'keefe said a man named david ferrie stopped by the house ... along with another young man ...

it adds a taste of elegance for which i must confess a weakness for now and then . i call him smedley . his real name is frankie jenkins - but i could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering `` frankie ! '' .. where is this leading to , mr. garrison ?

no .

this says `` mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green ford pickup truck . '' that 's not true . i recognized him and i told them so ... they also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck , which it was not . and here ... ... on the dallas sheriff 's report . this is really strange . see that notarized signature on the bottom of each page ? that 's not my signature . and there never was any notary present during any of my questioning . i guess that 's all ...

in the sheriff 's report , mrs. mercer , it says you were at dealey plaza two hours before the assassination but that ...

jim , before this kennedy thing , nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children . the other night jasper tried to show you a drawing . you did n't even notice he was there . he came to me bawling his little eyes out . jim , he 's sensitive - he needs more from you .

only cowards make crank calls , sweetheart , nothing is going to happen .

a man just called . he asked her everything !

it 's going to get worse , honey .

i do n't know what to say except i 'm sorry . i just do n't have rabbits on my mind .

my sympathies .

tough day .

liz , do i have to spell it out for you ? lee oswald was no ordinary soldier . that was no accident he was in russia . he was probably in military intelligence . that 's why he was trained in russian .

and then this colonel tries to make it sound like nothing . oswald did badly on the test , he says . `` he only had two more russian words right than wrong . '' ha ! that 's like me saying touchdown here ... ... is not very intelligent because i beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess .

it 's incredible , honey - the whole thing . a lieutenant colonel testifies that lee oswald was given a russian language exam as part of his marine training only a few months before he defects to the soviet union . a russian exam !

oh , she did , huh ? when i come up i 'll show you how saturday night got invented .

one hour , y'hear ? some saturday night date you are . mama warned me this would happen if i married such a serious man .

boss , then i 'm afraid i ca n't continue working with bill .

you never got anyone killed , boss . their actions killed them years before . if we stopped now , it 'd be even more wrong .

maybe we should just call it a day , lou . go home . while we 're still a little behind . we got two people killed , maybe more we never thought about .

they 're gon na love you , chief .

did n't hoover say something about that ? the leaves had fallen off in november ?

the key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other , and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing . the other problem is there was a tree right there ... blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the zapruder film .

i know you do , lou . i 'm doing three more lectures this month . you 're all doing an incredible job , sue , al , numa . but this is one where if you do n't nail the other guy , you 're dead . how did jack ruby dies so quick ? of what ? cancer , right ? a history of nazi germany , lou . they were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30 's . we learned a lot more than you think from the nazis . read this . our biological warfare lab is in fort detrick , maryland . close to where the national cancer institute is located . think about it . think the unthinkable - question everything .

mobbed up all the way . tight with the dallas cops . i 'm digging , chief . i just need 10 more men and some more dollars .

there was rose cheramie . a whore . two cubans threw her out of a car on the way to dallas .

graveyard dead . august this year . a single car accident on an empty road in midlothian , texas . the doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died .

the office of naval intelligence .

no word yet . but they think it 's in the head .

honey , another one of these . this one 's as weak as cricket pee-pee . yessir , you mark my words , jim , vietnam 's gon na cost johnson '68 and it 's gon na put that other varmint nixon in - then watch your hide , 'cause there ai n't no offramps on a freeway to hell !

i thought the fbi test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done ?

pictures like this do n't show up on television !

i 've been called everything under the sun , jerry . call me whatever you like .

welcome , district attorney garrison . may i call you jim ?

... and your general ?

i think it started in the wind . money - arms , big oil , pentagon people , contractors , bankers , politicians like l.b.j . were committed to a war in southeast asia . as early as '61 they knew kennedy was going to change things ... he was not going to war in southeast asia . who knows ? probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - houston , new york - hell , maybe bonn , germany ... who knows , it 's international now .

just speculating , i guess . how do you think it started ?

but you do n't have a choice anymore . you 've become a significant threat to the national security structure . they would 've killed you already , but you got a lot of light on you . instead , they 're gon na destroy your credibility ; they already have in many circles in this town . you 're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks . be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case , something , anything , make arrests , stir the shitstorm . you got ta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack . remember , fundamentally people are suckers for the truth , and the truth is on your side , 'bubba . i hope you get a break ...

the size of this is ... beyond me . testify ?

clay bertrand . he 's in the warren report . he tried to get oswald a lawyer . was kennedy ever discussed , jack ?

yeah , he was there , too ... sometimes he 'd be meeting with banister with the door shut . other times he 'd be shooting the bull with ferrie . but he was there all right .

banister was running his camp north of lake pontchartrain . ferrie handled a lot of the training . there was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in cuba . a few americans got trained , too . nazi types . mercenaries . but ferrie was the craziest .

dave ferrie - you know about him ?

you have other information ?

how much more ?

and he never hit you before ?

more than ten years .

hate mail here . fan mail here . the bad news is the irs has just requested an audit on your income from this office .

how long do you think it would take me to be appointed ?

stop your investigation ... it was a magnificent effort but it 's over and done with . the press is already on your behind and that 's only the beginning , my boy , only the beginning .

less than you would guess . most days two to three assistant d.a. 's . a handful of police investigators .

if you must know , virtually nothing .

i 'm glad you could find time to see me . i flew down from denver this morning on my private jet .

uh huh .

six .

what are they ?

no , that could not be done , mr. ruby . there are a good many things involved in that .

when are you going back to washington , sir ?

so you 're gon na call karen tomorrow ?

i mean it . i do n't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries .

i know . that 's why i went .

tomorrow i 'll talk to your probation officer . karen 's a good kid , but she 's mad at you , because you lied to her . this business about your grandmother 's funeral

course you did n't .

well , if you owe me , git your ass in the trunk .

i ca n't believe you do me this way .

go ahead .

man , i ai n't ready to be goin ' out nowhere --

i 'm gon na sell the other two tonight . this group of koreans in koreatown have started a neighborhood watch kinda thing . and they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business . so i 'm gon na sell 'em my two machine guns tonight . only problem , i ai n't never dealt with these koreans before . now i ai n't worried . asians are by and large real dependable . they do n't want no trouble . you might argue about price , but you ai n't got ta worry about them shootin ' you in the back . but i got me kind of a rule . never do business with nobody you ai n't never done business with before without backup . that 's why i need you , backup .

uh-huh .

that requires me goin ' out tonight ?

three years . that crime 's old , man . they ai n't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin ' people . how they gon na find room for you ?

how old is that machine gun shit ?

naw , man . they just tryin ' to put a fright in your ass .

i 'm still scared as a motherfucker , ordell . they talkin ' like they serious 'bout me doin ' that machine gun time .

you .

i told jackie , and jackie said you wanted him .

does he have the marked bills on him ?

she ai n't said it , but she 's not stupid , she knows it 's you who wants her .

she almost sounds scared .

what 's her name ?

bet you 're happy to be working again .

help you get ordell robbie .

while you 're at it , let me see what else is in there . you mind ?

help yourself .

hey , this is my office . there 's no smoking .

i 'm not saying another word .

would i mind ? do i have a choice ?

hi , i 'm detective mark dargus . l.a.p.d . can i ask what you have in that bag ?

i did n't use you , max .

i told him i might .

i saw ray the other day . boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement .

how does winston find him if a.t.f . and all the local police ca n't ?

how 'd you find out ?

where 's the rest of it ?

but you still have to show him the money at the airport .

he never came home . but i 'm sitting on the couch , in the dark , holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- so after a couple hours i think , `` what am i doing here ? nineteen years of this shit ? so i made up my mind , that 's it .

that 's my job .

and went to this guy 's house in el monte , and i waited for him .

the day you got me out of jail ?

when did you decide ?

you know where it came from . it 's not like it 's anybody 's life savings . it would n't even be missed .

no , i mean you , right now . not it you were somebody else .

what ? if i was in nicolet 's place ?

he tries to act cool .

you do n't propose something like that unless you 're pretty sure the other person 's into it .

i see .

i called you last night .

yea , but i 'm going to dress it up . put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone i meet here .

you talk them into it ?

i go back to work tomorrow .

why ?

yeah , she 's the girl who drove the bus in `` speed . '' she 's cute .

who was your girl before annette ?

well , i 'd never be so bold as to speak for all men , but as or myself and a few of my friends , that 's definitely the case . there 's a lot of actresses out there you like , and there 's some you have crushes on . but there 's always one who you love . and with her it 's sorta like going steady .

oh , are you ? does she know that ?

how was it ?

what 'd ya see ?

i know , ignoring me . what 're you up to ?

well , hello .

bigger ?

i 'm fine with it , or i would n't of done it , i did it to feel better about myself , and i do . when i look in the mirror it looks like me .

how do you feel about getting old ?

he had his doubts at first . but he 's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can .

we talked .

he came by .

it 's a lot of money . about a half-a- million dollars . all of it in cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin ' in .

i want to talk to them first . i know more now about ordell 's money .

what i meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you .

'74 , i think .

the delfonics .

i could n't wait till i got home last night and wash my hair .

sure .

thanks , but i have my own now .

i am . have a seat .

if you 're having some .

how many trips did you make ?

who gave me the money and who i was giving it to . and some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off . said it was him who told them 'bout me .

what did they want to know ?

i had 'em too . i burnt those two starky and hutch motherfuckers down . then their asses lucked out and found that coke .

you know who put the dope in your bag ?

shit .

so far i 've been told i can cooperate and get probation , maybe . or , i can stand mute and get as much as five years . does that sound right ?

was she helpful ?

davidoffs . i get 'em in mexico . they 're hard to find here . i was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin ' her boyfriend 's head open with a baseball bat .

why does it need to be dark ?

that does n't sound dark .

i thought you might want a drink ?

it 's okay . it 's a cop hangout .

sure , ever been to the riverbottom ?

who 's side are you on ?

well , sheronda , it was nice talking to you .

he say is a surprise .

what about me ?

you 'd take a polygraph on it ?

it 's possible . you 're saying you do n't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand ?

she did n't give me one . i told you before , melanie was n't part of the plan . ordell must of told her to do it . she bursts in , grabs the shopping bag , and takes off . what am i supposed to do , go after her ? i 'm in my fucking underwear . i had to get dressed before i could do anything . so i put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than i could my uniform .

si .

i 'm glad you realize that . saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you . put this in your shopping bag . it 's what i expect to find when i look in sheronda 's . comprende ?

oh , that 's taken care of . i called the state attorney 's office . you were no-filed this morning in circuit court .

right . everything 's the same , except one change ...

she did n't say .

was she there ?

uh-huh .

it was her coke i got busted with . she knows everything , but she 's not part of it , and she 's pissed cause she 's not part of it . ordell would n't even let her stay at the meeting . she tried to talk me into ripping off ordell .

... compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named simone hawkins .

not really .

this afternoon before i came here . he was with ordell at an apartment in hermosa beach . i do n't know if he lives there , but i can find out .

the envelope contains ten thousand dollars . the subject will be delivering the currency in a ...

this is a.t.f . agent ray nicolet , jackie brown , ordell robbie money exchange trial run . it 's three p.m. , july 4th 1997. the location is the parking structure at lax .

you ever see him sell guns ?

thanks for waiting , jackie . now tell me , what can we do for you ?

look , that shit ai n't mine .

yeah , do you like it ?

you believe that ? yeah , well , i guess you have to trust him . i 'd have second thoughts on that , but then i know 'em .

this time ? almost a year . i 've known him forever .

we 're partners , baby , sorta . i ai n't gon na screw you . you have n't told me where i put it for you .

who 's paging you ?

i 'm gon na be sittin ' at the titty bar in downtown l.a. till my man over here calls me and gives me the o.k . sign .

so you come out with her robinson's/may bag , go meet sheronda . simone peeks out , waits for my man louis here to give her a signal nobody 's watchin ' . she leaves the store , gets in her car -- mission accomplished .

right , the one simone gives me . simone and i 'll make the switch at robinson's/may . she knows what i look like ?

no , you gon na give her a robinson's/may bag this time ?

man , i do n't like that part .

now , hold on there . i ai n't pullin ' no shit . it 's my money , i can do whatever the fuck i wan na do with it .

well , you were n't supposed to be there .

i need to talk to you alone .

i ai n't gon na send no roc whore . the woman 's cool , i promise .

what 'd you care ?

plus the same deal as before .

that 's an agent . manager 's get fifteen percent .

so we need two people , two women .

and they follow the wrong one thinkin ' she 's bringing it to me .

no , i give it to someone else first .

if you want .

who ?

... i make two deliveries . the first one with ten thousand , like a dry run . they watch it . see how it works . then we do a second delivery , when i bring in the half mill .

what did they say ?

look , the only way i can get permission to fly is if i agree to help them . which is what i have to appear to be doing . so i give them something they already know . you .

you told em ? you told em it 's me ?

i told them .

it 's a cockatoo .

oh , wait , you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it ?

i been thinkin about that , too , and i got me a idea .

yeah .

all your money 's in mexico .

yeah ?

way i see it , me and you only got one thing to talk about . what you willing to do for me ?

now , baby , that 's got nothin ' to do with you . i just carry that . you been listenin ' to them cops too much .

they told me .

i was expecting you . come in .

you sure ?

i 'm getting out of here . what do you think ?

that 's a nice outfit on her . i 'm gon na go over and look at this michi moon display .

he went to meet that stewardess .

so what are you trying to tell me ? i should get out of here ?

i do n't like dancing .

i was pretty much the same height now as i was then .

two months shy of four years .

i 'm impressed . he knows a lot .

max cherry .

you gon na tell me who it was ?

jesus christ .

if there were nothin ; in here but towels , maybe she did n't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and a.t.f . got it . but , she put these fuckin ' books in here to trick our ass .

you sure she ai n't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars i worked my ass off to earn ?

where you shot her .

came outta where ?

louis ?

well , if you had to do it , you had to do it . what we do n't want is that bitch surviving on us . anybody but that woman .

in the chest and stomach .

where did you shoot her ?

you could n't just hit her ?

you shot melanie ?

that 's what i got ta tell you . she bugged me the whole time . got pissy with me 'cause i would n't let her carry the bag . started running her fuckin ' mouth ... i could n't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked , so she got on me about that . `` is it this aisle lou- is , is it that one ? '' she was totally fuckin ' with my nerves .

i have n't even looked at it yet , it 's still in the shopping bag .

it 's louis .

well , you the one in motherfuckin ' charge .

i told you , man . she my fine little surfer gal .

i still do n't understand why you keep her around .

'cause she my fine little surfer gal . she ca n't do me no harm . fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows . you could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you , she never understand a damn word .

well , why the fuck keep her around ?

she believed you ?

she one of the women i got set up . i got melanie in hermosa beach . i rent simone a small house in compton , and about four blocks away i got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named sheronda . i found her waitin ' for a bus two days outta alabama , barefoot , country as a chicken coop . took her to my house in compton , told her it was hollywood .

how much is there ?

so we on the same page then ?

yeah .

an employee i had to let go .

that was beaumont .

c'mon in .

guess where i am ?

whatcha watchin ' ?

now play the volume as loud as you want but do n't touch my levels . i got them set just the way i want 'em .

you ai n't got to do nothing . just point at it and push the button . you 'll hear the car go `` bleep . '' that means the alarm 's off and the doors are open .

this one 's for the ignition ... ... but you got ta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door .

that 's good money .

whatever looks best and starts the soonest .

you better be , motherfucker .

no .

uh-huh .

my money 's in that office , right ?

it 's the next street .

if she wanted to set you up , you 'd be in custody right now . when you said you 'd name her as an accessory she believed you . that scares her more than anything .

i 'm telling you , you got her spooked . she wo n't leave there till you have your money and you 're gone .

she wanted to see me , why was n't she home ?

and where 's jackie ?

and you did that to protect my interest ?

lift up your pant leg . you help her ?

well , give it to me then .

they decided to no-file . tell me where you are and i 'll bring you your money .

she got off , huh ?

mister robbie , is n't it ? i have the ten thousand you put up . is n't that why you called .

you know who this is ?

what 's up with this shit .

ordell , this is n't a bar , an you do n't have a tab .

i 'm telling you what i have to do . what you have to do , in case you forgot , is come up with premium of a thousand bucks .

that 's what the police thought . i told them i 'm unemployed , how could i have anybody work for me ? now i bail out jackie , i 'm liable to have the police on me again , huh ? wanting to know was she doing things for me , was she bringing me that money !

very first motherfuckin ' thing they did . they see i put up a big money bond on my boy , they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there 's fire logic . they roust my ass outta bed , ten o'clock in the morning . fuckin ' scare my woman , sherona , half to death . she thought they were gon na take my ass away for sure .

somebody with a grudge blew beaumont 's brains out -- hey , that rhymes -- blew beaumont 's brains out .

oh , yeah ? what did he do ?

i can see that . why ?

beaumont ai n't going nowhere . where do i sign ?

house or apartment ?

i need your name and address .

what 's his full name ?

you think you could do that ?

ten thousand sounds high .

you have it with you ?

gon na have to put up cash .

where would you like me to put my ash ?

try not to rip his clothes off 'em they 're new .

no problem .

hope you do n't mind keeping him company .

we 're back .

you know it 's for you .

let me speak to max cherry .

cherry bail bonds .

no ! that was years ago ! i 've lived years since then .

what are you then ?

dead ? no . i just hurt my back . i 'm not dead .

take me home .

where do you want to go ?

i see .

it 's fun .

no , do n't . but thanks .

do you want some help ? i can call upstairs .

i 'm okay .

me , too .

you know , i 've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist . nothing penetrates that night . nothing .

let go !

oh god !

it 's short , huh ?

you know , you got a strange line here .

hey , wait !

goddamn it . what kind of bullshit is that ?

maybe it 's not the army , jake .

jesus christ ! who 's been talking to you ? what 's going on ? how can you just turn away ? what about the others ?

that 's right . we did .

frank . it 's jake . jacob singer .

hello .

it was the window .

gabe ? what are you doing ... ?

war games ? thailand ? that 's not true ! how can you believe that ? ca n't you see what they 're doing ? it 's all a lie . we were in da nang , for god 's sake . you 've got to believe me .

ah ! well then , they 're going to have to pay for that , are n't they ?

doctor . ph.d .

i 'm sorry , mr. singer , but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world ? it 'd break your heart .

you think they 're connected ?

we should get ourselves a lawyer .

not my head , buddy . not me . i 'm gettin ' a headache just listenin ' to you .

an explosion , just like paul 's .

what are you doing ?

god almighty . what did you do to me ?

if it was any other brain but yours , i might agree . relax , this is going to be strong .

what can i tell you , louis ? after nam i did n't want to think anymore . i decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos .

her problem is that you spent eight years getting a phd and then went to work for the post office .

she talk about the boys ?

how do you know ?

i'venever understood you , you know that ? you were by far the best pupil i 've ever had , bar none . intellectu- ally , you were the most original , the most imaginative . who knows , maybe you 've been `` elected '' to see demons . maybe you 're in touch with ... some- thing . nothing would surprise me about you jacob . nothing .

but i see them .

i need your insight , your intuition .

i 'm with another woman now . we 're both with the post office , midtown , 34th street branch .

i have n't seen her in months .

that 's ridiculous . i 've been coming here for years . listen to me . i 'm going out of my fucking mind here . i need to see him .

whataya mean , no record ?

jacob singer .

look , i need to see him . i know where his room is . just give me a pass . i wo n't be long . ten minutes .

save me !

jacob , what can i do ?

go to sleep .

she was good in bed , though .

this is healthy ? i 'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy .

it 's not healthy with it closed .

tell me , damn you !

i loved your chemist , jake . the height of fantasy . and your vision of paradise . a most romantic creation . you 're quite a dreamer , jake . only it 's time to wake up .

wake up ! stop playing with yourself . it 's finished .

west .

mid-town mostly .

i 'm not upset .

why wo n't you answer me ?

you know who i am .

tell me , damn you !

sit down .

sit down , jake .

what 're you ... ? where 's sarah ? where are the boys ?

no . i 'm a marked man , jez . i 'm the only one left . i do n't want to expose you to that . it 's not right for you or me . be reasonable .

please .

stick with me , kid .

this is one of my dreams , jake . ever since i was a little girl . i never thought it would happen .

i 'm gon na make love to you . that 's what i 'm gon na do .

what are you doing here ? are you all right ? how do you expect to pay for this ? everyone 's looking for you , jake . i dodged people all over the place , reporters , police . i do n't know what you 're gon na do .

who was that ?

do n't !

you wan na know ? turn on the t.v . watch the fucking news !

what ? what do you mean ?

why did n't you call me ?

i put a frozen dinner in the oven , a manhandler . it 'll be ready at a quarter of . i threw a little salad together . it 's in the fridge . i also bought some apple juice , red cheek . do n't drink it all . oh , and jake , your lawyer called .

you know what ? i feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone .

are we in brooklyn ?

here . i 'll do it .

hey , i 'm not dressed .

sam , tony , come in here .

look at me . i 'm ice cold .

that 's your decision .

that you 'd die on the way to the hospital . now get into that tub .

ca n't you stop it ?

show me della !

why ? what for ?

where ?

oh , come on . it 's early .

come on . what were they , jake ?

demons , jake ? come on . they 're winos and bag ladies . low life . that 's all they are . the streets are crawling with 'em . do n't make em into somethin ' they 're not . it 's the pressure , honey . that 's all it is .

what does that have to do with anything ? does it explain the barricaded subway stations ? does it explain those godforsaken creatures ?

maybe it 's all the pressure , jake . the money . things like that . or your wife .

i 'll be glad to avoid the crush .

well , i 'll miss riding home with you . i was looking forward to it .

i 'm going home .

is that the one who died ?

she looked good then .

what 's in here ?

a good lay .

what happened to you ?

it is tomorrow . four a.m. how come you 're so late ?

what do you think ?

no . i could n't .

here . i 've got every credit card ever printed . take this . stay here till you can arrange to get away . it 's on me .

well that 's good to know .

what is it ?

i came up with the formula back in nam but i never got a chance to use it .

hey , i 'm not the problem . you 've got bigger problems than me .

how do i know this is n't just some kind of , you know , seduction or something ?

sometimes . when it 's convenient .

because i can get rid of the demons . i can block the ladder . i have an antidote . we can kill them off , chemically speaking . they 'll all disappear . it 's chemistry , my friend . i know . i created it . come with me . i can help .

if you knew , why did n't you say anything ?

who then ?

a couple of days later . it was fierce . you guys never saw it .

yeah , sure . we were losing the war .

no shit . they had me by the balls . next thing i know i 'm in saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs . not the street stuff mind you . they had us isolating special properties . the dark side , you know ? they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies .

tan ? what tan ? it faded on the airplane . i 'd try to get my money back , but who do you ask ? two hundred dollars a night , for what ?

where 's wong ?

how 'bout over there ? no wait . do me a favor . bring 'em to the back room .

what ? !

what is wrong with you ?

throw that torch away , young man . give yourself up . you 're under arrest .

he 's burning up .

no . no . you have n't had any visitors .

i 'm awake ?

the army ?

you 've seen them ?

do n't do anything . paul , i know what you 're talking about .

i do n't know what to do .

that 's as straight as i can put it . and do n't tell me that i 'm crazy 'cause i know i 'm not . i 'm goin ' to hell . they 're comin ' after me .

pull the mirror down on the sun visor . just watch 'em .

that black car ?

you ca n't talk in brownsville ?

nope .

it 's not worth it . you 'll never win .

no joke . fuckin ' army ! that goddamn war . i 'm still fightin ' it .

i need to see you .

jacob singer ?

no . no . it 's okay . i 'm okay .

do you want me to get someone ?

blew up ? what do you mean it blew up ?

i 'm so sorry . obviously you have n't ... dr. carlson died .

he 's not part of the program .

pause play .

you got lucky . i could have waited until he ate your head .

that 's nine to four , geek-boy .

i do n't know . nothing .

can we blow it with just two ?

we do n't have a choice !

that 's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship .

then break it ! if you do n't pull it , the ship 's going to depressurize !

could you show a little compassion ? !

okay , he was a great guy , now let 's move out .

we 're not leaving crutch !

rizzo did .

two more charges to go .

then you better hurry . i 'll blow alley one , delongpre , you and rizzo take there . janessa you ready two and we 'll meet up there .

hey ! i 'm not ready .

i do n't know !

i think i speak on behalf of the group when i say this is bad news .

what ?

wait a minute ... i need ...

fine , just stay out of my way . hit it .

i doubt that . i think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us .

kicker , sven . get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on !

they were all wrong . they could n't control him .

i thought you meant ...

that 's a good fantasy , though . kinky , but good .

rizzo ? !

400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do ? !

we 're screwed !

well , i 'm not hanging out here with ms. showtunes .

yeah and he 'll be here soon enough . last chance .

maybe we should go with them . like you said , your space lab connections can deal with this thing . at least we 'll be safe .

god damnit ! will you stop doing that ? !

spunky . . .

now what ?

i 'll help you in .

kaboom .

just go ! i 've a feeling he 's right behind us !

i feel better . now how do you fire this damn thing ?

they 're not gon na make it . close the door before he gets us all .

now this is getting exciting .

thank you .

keep your shirt on ! i 'm working on it . you wo n't believe what we found . adrienne ! stoney !

you 're leaving me here alone ?

would you ?

so what else is new ?

let 's just get out of here .

that ought ' a help the situation .

jesus !

you prefer an apple ?

i 'm just saying .

i 'm afraid i can not assist .

barbie from hell ...

robot huh ?

kay-em you okay ?

yes , i 've reprogrammed you . you are very brave . bad ass .

in twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .

somebody wanted the place to stay hidden .

the air 's laced with type two ozone , it reads as a solid .

leave him behind !

what ? ! !

damn ! close the door ! i 'll be right back .

thirty seconds .

how do you know ?

alright , i 'm . . . no way . . . is this a joke ?

how do you open the damn door ?

rizzo , a shuttle out in the middle of space ? we 'll die oout there .

listen to me . please . let 's get off thsi ship . come with me .

yes !

what have i done ? ! idiots .

what have you done ?

do me this favor just once . use the ponds .

you 're not going to the ocean with that , are you son ?

he 's comin ' up -- !

he 's chasing us ! i do n't believe it .

dead astern ! zig-zag !

have to pump her steady , s'all .

what about us ?

tattoo . had it taken off .

what 's the point with hooks and lines ? --

get behind me , dummy ! reverse her and turn -- he 's taking too much line ! wet my reel , quick !

you got it ?

what do you mean 'we ... ? '

hey . knock it off . i do n't want to have to listen to this while we 're out there ...

and , uh , a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch .

and you get the mayor off my back with this zoning crap . nobody tells me how to run my property .

you got it .

no . home here .

why do n't we have one more drink , you and i , and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what 's inside him , or not .

he 's sitting in it .

love a cup of tea . with lemon .

you 're very tight , y'know ? right there .

older , sillier .

i think they make you look sexy .

you want to go through those ? i 'm taking them to the thrift shop . it 's marcia vaughn 's pet charity . pick out what you want to keep -- it 's mostly your city clothes .

feed the dogs .

right .

i was acting in the town 's best interests ...

what kind of a shark did you say it was ?

i was only reacting to what i was told .

i do n't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things .

so we should set out a smorgasbord ?

y'know , i used to hate the water ...

do n't shoot him any more ! he 's crazy on his own blood already !

i hope we get some more help .

why do n't we just tow it in ?

it is a job . i 'm not fooling around like some amateur . it 's my life !

i bought it . both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me ; stocks went up , so i do n't have to touch my principal .

if you 're looking for a shark , you do n't look on land . you go out and chum for him .

... nothing .

no , but tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean . they eat anything . but this one did n't eat any people . there 's nothing here ...

he ate a car ?

florida license plate .

we ought to let it breathe ... whatever .

swell .

left arm , head , shoulders , sternum and portions of ribcage intact . please do n't smoke . with minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions . bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali , possibly carchaninus lonimanus , or isurus glaucas . gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis ; however , teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters . -- did you go out in a boat and look around ?

... height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains . torso severed in mid-thorax , eviscerated with no major organs remaining . may i have a drink of water ? right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature . portions of denuded bone remaining . -- did you notify the coast guard ?

there 's a fantail launch out there that wo n't make it beyond the breakwater .

oh , no , sir . i 've never had a woman do that . i 'm sure she drowned .

and nobody else saw her in the water ?

polly told me to tell you there 's a scout troop in avril bay doing the mile swim for their merit badges . i could n't call them in , there 's no phone out there .

i agree . if she 's going to advertise , i would n't recommend out-of-town papers . amity people could take care of this .

what else could 've done that ?

look at him take it !

twenty years .

you do this all the time , right , charlie ?

set ?

we 're blowin ' half the bounty on bait --

yeah , charlie , i got my second wind three nibbles back .

martin hates boats . hates the water . on the ferry to the mainland , he sits in the car the whole way over . he 's got this childhood thing , there 's a clinical word for it .

is it ! the best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark ... around the world in 18 months .

i do . but you 've still got a problem here , there 's a shark just off the island somewhere .

my husband tells me you 're in sharks .

c'mon , it 'll give us time to think about what they 're going to say .

follow him !

he 's heading under -- !

coming right to us !

i 'll drink to your leg .

face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room . this love line here ... ... that 's from some crazy frenchie come after me with a knife . i caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas .

at least you handle the boat all right . stop . here ... cut the engine .

a marlin , or a stingray . huh . do n't ever tell me my business again . get back up on the bridge .

look -- you may be a big yahoo in the lab , but out here you 're just supercargo , and you 'll do as i say , or you can take your gear and backstroke home . now get down here !

hey , you ! farmer ! half-speed there ...

that 's pilot whale , is n't it ?

anti-shark cage .

hey , squirt ! you want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast ? it ai n't good for much but bait .

look , i do n't need to hear any of this working class hero crap . some party boat skipper who 's killed a few sharks ...

let me see your hands ...

i do n't need to pass basic seamanship .

transplants ?

well , i 'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence . we depend on the summer people for our lives , and if our beaches are closed , then we 're all finished .

thanks for the message .

juno macguff called while you were out running . she wants to know if you 're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on saturday .

i 'm not hungry , oddly .

i do n't think so .

the pebbles forgive me , the trees forgive me . so why ca n't you forgive me ? i do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .

i kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train . i kiss you all starryeyed , my body 's swinging from side to side . i do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .

okay .

wizard !

it does ?

also , i think i 'm in love with you .

wait , let me take that .

oh my god , shut up !

like i 'd marry you ! you would be the meanest wife of all time . and anyway , i know you were n't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on tv . the blair witch project was on starz , and you were like , `` oh , i want to watch this , but we should make out instead . la la la . ''

why ? because i got bored and had sex with you one day , and then i did n't , like , marry you ?

you 're mad . why are you mad ?

leah just told me you were going with her .

are you honestly and truly going to prom with katrina de voort ?

i do n't . katrina smells like soup . her whole house smells of soup .

we could get back together too .

hey junebug , when all this is over we should get the band back together again .

the guy is super cool ! his name is mark and he 's into old horror movies and he plays guitar . i actually hung out with him today .

so , it looks like you 're getting pregnant-er these days .

i just wanted to come over . you know , say hi . i miss hanging out with you on school nights .

i 'll try to drop by later .

hey juno ... a couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids .

charisma ?

i do n't mind . you definitely bring something to the table .

oh yeah . i 'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner , huh ?

well ! nothing like experimenting .

i 'm real sorry i had sex with you . i know it was n't your idea .

so , what do you think we should do ?

i 'm supposed to be running .

i do n't know ...

yup .

oh , hey vijay .

hey man .

what are you talking about ?

excuse me ?

no ... i guess not .

did you see it coming when she sat us down here ?

no , i mean the father ! who 's the father , juno ?

nails ? really ?

shit . hey , can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already ?

it 's called a spinal block , and you ca n't have it yet , honey . the doctor said you 're not dilated enough .

yeah , because you 're allergic to their saliva . i 've made a lot of sacrifices for you , juno . and in a couple years you 're going to move out -- and i 'm getting weimaraners .

they said they wanted to know about this stuff . they said to keep them updated , so i did !

but they have a real lawyer and everything . i 'm going to meet with them next weekend .

well , i was just asking . it seemed plausible .

no , i mean in your pregnancy .

i 'm a junior .

what ? my eyes are not lying !

this ... ... this is what my life has become . stuff in boxes . stuff underground . is that so appealing to you ?

i ... how do you think of me , juno ? why are you here ?

but you 're old !

a baby is not going to fix everything . besides , i do n't know if i 'm ready to be a father .

what 's the matter ?

what ?

wow , i actually feel like less of a fat dork now .

oh god , you 're one of those guys ...

hilarious . no , i just keep all of my old comics down here , and i want to show you one of them .

come on , i have something for you .

consider it your musical education .

i imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point .

so , i 've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird cd you made me .

you should have gone to china . i heard they give away babies like free ipods . they shoot 'em out of those t-shirt guns at sports events .

why ?

hey , what kind of swag did you score ?

i 'll handle this . i 'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage .

vanessa . shit , you better get out of here .

i weighed my options . but after all this , i 'm glad i did n't , you know , get rid of it . i want to have it . for you guys .

uh , thanks .

my dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with greek and roman mythology . he named me after zeus 's wife . i mean , zeus had other lays , but i 'm pretty sure juno was his only wife . she was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean . like diana ross .

well , sort of . vanessa likes madison for a girl .

please . dario argento is the ultimate master of horror .

yeah , i definitely need to make you some cds . at least while my kid is hanging out in there .

this album is all carpenters covers by alt-rock bands . it 's called if i were a carpenter . it is god . i 'll rip a copy for you before you leave .

what is it ?

behold , good sir ! the very first photo of your future child .

they 'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home .

you 're kind of a sellout , are n't you ? what would the melvins say ?

i wrote that .

like what ?

no shit . like johannes brahms ?

why are n't you at work ?

what is that , mahogany ? what happens if you crack the neck ?

viscera ?

you should be happy , holmes . i 'm giving you and vanessa the gift of life . sweet , screaming , pooping life ! and you do n't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in ...

no .

this is our attorney , gerta rauss .

i heard that was you .

wise move . i know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once . she took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at ridgedale mall and she was like , `` blaaaaah ! i 'm a kraken from the sea ! ''

oh , hi juno . how are you ?

uh , hi su-chin .

are you kidding ? everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly . i 'm like a legend . they call me the cautionary whale .

right . well , juno , your parents must be wondering where you are . you might want to head home .

oh my god ...

so , then , you really think you 're going to go ahead with this ?

well , shall we start looking over the paperwork ? gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents .

oh , that 's marvelous . so you 're almost into your second trimester , then ?

juno macguff .

hi . i 'm here for the big show ?

either i just pissed my pants or ...

i sort of already have .

tore up from the floor up ?

you look a little morose , honey . what 's eating you ?

yeah , she does .

i also have good teeth . no cavities . we finally got fluoridated water in dancing elk .

i have no idea what kind of girl i am .

which maneuver , sir ? the one in which i moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another , or the one in which i cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes ?

my dad used to be in the army , but now he 's just your average hvac specialist . he and my mom got divorced when i was five . she lives on a havasu reservation in arizona ...

so what 's the prognosis , fertile myrtle ? minus or plus ?

jesus , i did n't say it was .

well , well . if it is n't macguff the crime dog ! back for another test ?

are you jealous ? i thought you said you did n't care what he did .

i would n't be so sure about that . he did it with you . he 's a man now .

there 's no way in hell they 're having sex or even holding hands .

he asked her . i heard they were going to benihana , then the prom , then to vijay 's parents ' cabin .

eww , he 's all beardy !

keith 's hot .

well , you are kind of ... convex .

hot !

god , spermy . must you always feed ?

she 's gon na steal that kid for her collection .

i just thought she 'd look really old in real life .

that 's her . that 's vanessa loring .

or stage parents !

how do you know i 'm so poisonous ? like , what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters ?

hey , i 'm a sacred vessel . all you 've got in your belly is taco bell !

yeesh , they sound like a cult . besides , they 're greedy bitches . they already have three kids !

all right , how about this one ? `` healthy , educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five . you will be compensated . help us complete the circle of love . ''

i was thinking a graphic designer , mid-thirties , and his cool asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass . but i 'm trying to not be too particular .

come on , leah . i ca n't scope out wannabe parents in the penny saver ! that 's tacky . that 's like buying clothes at the pump n ' munch .

keep your voice down dude , my mom 's around here somewhere . she does n't know we 're sexually active .

i could n't do it , leah ! it smelled like a dentist in there . they had these really horrible magazines , with , like , spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains , like someone read them in the tub . and the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers , and she told me about her boyfriend 's pie balls , and su-chin kuah was there , and she told me the baby had fingernails . fingernails !

it was magnificent , man !

when did you decide you were going to do bleeker ?

nah , it was a premeditated act . the sex , i mean , not getting pregnant .

heavy lifting can only help you at this point .

no it 's morgan freeman . got any bones that need collecting ?

so . what 's that thing ?

i do n't know . there 's just things i still want to do .

ever since , it 's just been like a ticking clock .

i 've been just wondering if we 're , you know , ready .

hm .

i just think it 's too early to paint . that 's my opinion .

i think i 'm leaning toward custard in this light . i do n't know . i should paint a small area ...

they 're yellow .

you guys are playing music ?

vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married .

are you looking for any other compensation ?

... anything else ?

carryin ' a gun .

sorry . boy i 'll tell ya , if early found a picture of me like that i 'd be black and blue for a week .

i 'm cool .

you can ?

you know i can fix that haircut for you , if you want ?

so you do n't do any of those things .

early do n't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor .

i changed my mind , early . i 'm not gon na climb up that hollywood sign with you ... i decided . i think your mean , and you hurt people .

nobody wants to hurt you peaches !

what 's wrong with her ?

thank you for what ? what are you thanking me for adele ?

... thank you .

bull . that ai n't right ... government sends people there all the time , just do n't want us to know about it .

well dorothy , why do n't you hand me that chili there .

turkey 's are real smart . smarter than most people think ...

never heard of it , any huntin ' ?

what 's your name , boy ?

so tell me ... what happened here ?

forget about it , does n't matter .

damn right i do .

wait a minute . you 're gon na hustle me ?

you wan na hear mine ?

yeah .

it 's just a work in progress , kinda rough .

uh , we can stop somewhere if you and adele have n't had time for breakfast , early .

you got ta talk to her . she looks up to you , she 'll listen to you .

i 'm finished .

stop being so fucking melodramatic ! if it was murder he 'd still be locked up or on parole , in which case he would n't be allowed to leave the state .

you try , i 'm gon na pretend they 're with somebody else .

he ca n't help the way he was raised . i kinda feel sorry for him .

lighten up ...

it 's about fucking time , kessler ! i 'd just about given up on you .

a book on some of the most infamous murderers in america . i want to go to where they lived and where they killed and i want you to photograph it .

a book on the warehouse murders ?

... i think it 's the best stuff i 've done .

well , i sat down with my tapes and your photographs , which are great by the way ... and i started writing .

hey . i did n't have the heart to wake you .

no we ca n't . we can never leave once you start talking about tenure ... and vacation pay ... and parking privileges and ... oh shit ! let 's just go to california now , right now , before it 's too late .

the party ?

who do i have to blow to get out of here ?

... soon as he finishes his thesis .

... apprehensive . let 's not forget these are the people who banned the mapplethorpe show . anyway , california 's loaded with galleries .

any word from that gallery ?

... i know i 'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face .

siesta .

no , never . excuse me .

no .

bri ' .

... janitor 's job .

i ai n't got nothing against god . it 's the people he let come into the world ... lot of them should have been stopped at the door . what are you looking for ?

you 're supposed to call me when you lose your job early . i stopped by the mirror factory today , you left quite a mess behind there .

... that 'd be my guess .

who are you ?

what happened ?

now you got ta be careful .

you 're clean .

with how many people ?

hmm . i 'd say eight , maybe nine .

yo , you got any weed around here ?

holy shit man , your mom 's got good titties .

so really , it 's good luck .

why i give pennies ?

how are you gon na fuck two virgins in a day ? that shits got ta be against the law .

at that moment , at that block party , she represented everything holy about a virgin .

i know what you mean .

she was handing out those watermelon slices . and i sat down over on the other side , and i watched her .

yeah .

yeah . she 's so little , so pretty , and innocent .

oh . you like her ?

who ?

yeah me too nigga .

man i have n't seen her in forever . what the fuck 's she up to ?

no , i 'm serious man . i 'm dead ass . do you wan na try ? we could be like the fuckin x-rated `` wonder twins '' !

what do you want ?

shit .

did you tell her that you loved her ?

you mean like fucking two virgins at once .

and for a second i felt a little bit guilty . you know , because she 's young and all . and then i was like , oh shit , that turns me on . i wan na fuck this little baby girl .

yeah .

well it took me longer than i thought it would take . it took like 15 minutes to talk her into it . but once it was on , we fucked for a good half an hour . i had to keep taking it out and putting it back in . it hurts the first time .

did what take ?

you fucked it ?

casper , where is he ?

do you care about me ?

i 'm nervous .

i do n't even want to talk , but i got ta tell you that when i first saw you last week , i , i could n't stop thinking about you . you 've been stuck in my head .

i think you 're like the best girl i 've ever kissed .

yes .

yeah ?

yeah . i can understand that .

she wo n't ? why not ?

yeah .

ooh . you 're gon na give me goose bumps .

hold on .

right now ?

i was just getting ready to take a bath .

hey . what are you doin ' right now ?

no ...

bang up stuff .

of course i do .

i would n't believe it ?

because , you know why . you know .

what do i want to do ?

yeah .

telly is at steven 's ?

were you protected ?

now that 's it . a smile . you look like a prom queen when you smile . like a glamour girl .

no .

no , not everything ? the sun is still shinning . it 's a beautiful day out . some things are ok. right ?

everything is wrong .

sorry .

a bad day ! you wan na hear a bad day ? yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor . she had a minor heart attack . partial paralysis . but i do n't let myself get sad . no way . not me . it 's not good for the soul .

because gee , you do n't look ok. i mean you 're a very beautiful young lady . it 's just that you look troubled that 's all ...

no . i 'm ok. thanks .

oh hi jennie . do you want to come make out with me ?

hello paul . is telly inside ?

i got ta find him .

do n't go anywhere . stay with me .

i got ta go . i got ta find telly .

i only did it once and ...

yeah . and you 're not getting anything out of it .

and sometimes it takes a long time , and you 're fucking gagging .

mine ?

like where are your erogenous zones ?

you did n't ?

i did n't bleed .

i knew he would n't want to speak to me . that dick .

telly says was up .

i 'll ask you one last time . do you have diss digg ?

you know ... you know a lot of times sex gets in the way . has that ever happened to you ?

yeah . and sex is just like , yeah let 's have sex .

and the other person i just fucked , which was a mistake . but i went to the clinic last week with jennie .

yeah .

yeah . fifteen minutes to a half an hour . hard and deep .

but then the sex gets into the way and you 're like : what happened ! what the hell happened ? !

it 's really slow . it 's slow boring .

making love is like .

no .

how can you hang out with casper ? he 's such a jerk .

sorry . dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job .

yep .

what are you guys doing ?

it 's me . telly .

no , no , no . you ca n't get that taste out of your mouth . until you eat something .

yeah . i had sex with jake , and it took him like an hour and a half .

and we were like underneath the sheets . we were going at it like crazy . oh my god that shit was so good ! it was like hard ...

it 's grandmother style .

slow .

come on steven hook me up . do me this solid . come on man . i got ta get darcy alone . she 's gon na let me fuck her man . please .

you 're a lying bastard !

i 'm positive .

i was at the beach .

well then , you just got ta find out where he is -- and once you 're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker .

what if he does n't bite ? what if he 's an exceptionally bright raccoon ?

of course it was . otherwise i 'd be breaking and entering . that 's a felony .

how 'd you get in here ?

i would n't know .

maybe you should .

we did n't ask for your opinion , doctor .

let 's see how much he wants to play .

oh , we 'll be back . you can bet on it .

we seem to have a little problem here ?

by yourself ?

i got ta friend over there . he was telling me things are kind of slow . so , i figured i 'd give him a call , have him come down here and look through your records . you know , give him something to do .

i spoke to jeremy . he 's watching sanderson 's kid . sanderson went out after the match and has n't come back since .

i 've seen a lot of things in my time on the job , but nothing like this . yurilivich ?

you alright ?

how is she ?

yeah , i am . i think he 's playing us . if i was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me , what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else ?

you still having a problem with this ?

no shit !

take it easy . both of you .

what do you think ?

jesus , you 're sleeping with the guy . you 've lost your perspective . you ca n't possibly be unbiased .

he was with me ?

do n't fuck with us ! where did you go !

you 're groping . i have been fair . it 's my move now .

hello , peter .

-- you 're hopeless ! you ca n't even read a sentence ! did n't they teach you punctuation in school ? the game ends tonight !

i 'm beginning to think it does n't mean anything . remember eventually revenge- -

what word did you leave last night ?

you 're not playing very well . there are clues all around you and you keep missing them .

i really wish you 'd stop trying to maneuver me . i find it irritating , not to mention insulting .

not really .

if you got something to say to me , just come out and say it !

what ?

that 's something you 'll have to figure out for yourself . really , peter , you ca n't expect me to answer such direct questions .

we all have paths to follow . you hope yours will lead you to me .

yes . why did you kill debi rutlege ?

just a second . hello ?

i have n't got time for this .

you do n't understand .

you still have n't figured it out , have you ? you think that i 've put you through an ordeal . my scars run so much deeper than yours .

new york . 1986. viktor yurilivich .

set up some pieces on the big board ?

nope . nothing .

no problem . we 're in .

he was watching you .

why did he what ?

i 'm just nervous . sorry .

how come the police never had a record of sanderson before . this does n't come out of nowhere , there has to be a history .

do n't patronize me ! you sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and did n't warn me !

-- the same type as the girl who got killed . jesus , alan , the guy could be a psychopath .

you 're damn right ! i 'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer !

of course .

for what ?

thanks , david .

i see . you forgot to bring you 're night-light , did n't you ?

what are you doing up ?

my cheering section .

how long she been dead ?

this is where he forced his way in . we found some fibers on the windowsill , probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through . i 'll know more once i get it under the microscope .

no prints .

bingo .

there 's no blood . where 's the fuckin ' blood ?

six , eight hours tops .

no . he was wearing a mask ... but i saw the cut on his wrist . it was peter .

this stinks ! you want to know what i think ? i think there have been five murders and you 've got shit to go on . you need to blame someone and he 's the easiest choice .

we ca n't rely on your judgement anymore .

he moves around a lot . why ?

it ca n't be a coincidence . the woman that owns it has a son . she says he 's been on vacation in montana for the last ten days . we 're trying to locate him . there 's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week . we 're checking that out too .

well , i think you have to play to his ego . he thinks he 's superior . the more secure he feels , the more chances he 'll take .

that would indicate he 's playing out a fantasy . power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them . once they become a reality though , they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it . but , in all the research i 've read on serial killers , i 've never heard of one moving so fast . it 's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around .

kathy ?

-- edmonds . i know . you lost to karpov in '82 , did n't you ?

and this jeremy --

you did n't pick up any vibes from the guy ?

you know , i hate to say i told you so , but i warned her . coming home at all hours of the night . a young girl new to the city . this neighborhood ai n't what it used to be .

if you can think of anything else give us a call .

this is insane ! ca n't you see what 's going on . the killer wants me out of the way . he 's setting me up .

maybe he just got tired of covering for you .

that 's got to be it .

a building is n't as light as air . what 's large , but as light as air and ca n't be moved ?

it 's a commercial area . no one lives there .

he 's using the map as a chessboard ! the sonofabitch is playing chess with me ! !

we think he might be making a reference to drugs ? miss emma is a street term used by junkies for morphine .

i got it from the tournament directory .

to my room and then i went for a walk .

i know . you won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five . where did you go after that ?

only in passing . to say hello to .

feel like practicing ?

no .

is it serious ?

our computer went on the fritz again . david came up to fix it .

you do n't win by playing it safe , peter .

it 's a good play , but risky .

then i 'll transpose .

we 'll call you back .

it 's over now .

yeah . i 'll be there later .

you 're going to be late for your match .

this is n't going to be like the phone book , is it ?

how did you know it was `` carefully '' ?

this letter . i 've never opened it .

i ca n't think any more , unless it 's about you . i 'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move , i think about how you look when you smile . remember how you said that i hide behind my chessboard ? ever since my wife died i 've been ... i 've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them .

i want someone i can get close to . i do n't know if that 's possible with you .

hi .

exactly . it 's the key .

for emphasis ?

peter ...

if i have to . i 'm going to take a shower .

i 'm hungry .

this frightens me -- because i 'm starting to feel things i have n't felt in a long time .

what are you talking about ? you do n't even know me .

yes you are . you 're playing word games .

and you ?

it must 've been very hard on erica ?

i dunno . where 's erica mother ?

was n't i just talking about me ?

you know , you 're not the easiest person in the world to get close to .

i 'm sure you are .

because i think he 's wrong .

you know , andy thinks you 're doing this .

i know you did n't

why ?

of course .

very good . spoken like a true psychologist . when confronted with the prospect of your own reality , hide behind quotations . what is that masters and johnson ?

i 'm just curious .

let 's change the subject .

do you ?

take your average cop . they deal with death everyday . if they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement .

she could be dead after the game .

we need your help .

did you think it was going to be easy ? you think he was going to lay it out at your feet ?

getting too hot in here for you ?

each circumstance requires a different tactic .

do you always open quickly ?

i thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess .

that 's a very personal question .

not really . you see your goal and you go after it . anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed .

i 've always wanted to learn how to play chess . i do n't have the patience for it . when did you start playing ?

uh huh .

are you with the tournament ?

how come you do n't stay with them ?

it 's alright .

well , then this time you 'll have to stay for the whole match , wo n't you ?

you 're getting sloppy , yurilivich . you 're nervous ?

i 'm sure you are .

yes .

in the arctic ice .

will your power outward .

where is the fortress ?

lyssa . where are they keeping you ?

have they harmed you ?

thank you , but i can wait .

never mind my ears ! go away !

i do n't trust you to wash behind your ears .

well , then you can go up to the parapet and i 'll hand the buckets up to you .

mine was worse : i dreamt you picked your nose in public .

oh . that . i know what you mean . i had nightmares all week .

i 'm sorry . i could n't help it .

she 's on the other side of this wall . i can feel it !

where the spiral begins .

you must never know her name . if more than one approaches , she will certainly kill them . alone i may have a chance .

then we must reach her before she feels that pain .

you are young . you do n't understand the attraction of great power , and you forget the pain of long waiting .

no . she must agree of her own free will .

he has come for lyssa .

i can not reach her .

the deeper she goes , the harder it is to contact her . once she is below the second level , you will not be able to reach her at all .

yes , they knew of your first contact , so they drove her below .

darkness . tunnels and corridors . wait .

i ca n't reach her .

they know when they 're going to die ?

it is the fortress of krull . i know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds . they did not use it on our world in the first great war , for it costs them enormous power . this time they mean to conquer , at all costs .

lyssa ... lyssa ...

there is nothing .

you wo n't have to .

you have rope ?

i have lived in this place , like my fathers before me , guarding the old knowledge . i knew , when i had no son , that the great war would come in my time , and that i would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king . come .

each to his fate .

it is today ?

i road them often in my youth .

we must enter the swamp .

i can not .

you too are lonely .

yes .

i know the cruelty of such a fate .

try your tricks on me and i 'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you .

no more , my lord - my friend . with ergo the magnificent by your side , your enemies are dead men .

staying alive .

what business ?

for that rudeness , peasant lout , i am going to leave you hanging by your heels when i depart . which is right now .

perhaps he expected to eat it .

there 's no way to outrun it . you know that . this is what ynyr was preparing me for . it 's what he died for .

perhaps . if the pay is good .

at the gallop !

we must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise .

go . i command you .

go , join them .

hand over your dinner .

when did you last sleep , boy ?

it should be an interesting journey , then .

to the place where death lives .

you will follow me .

i can not go with you , my friend .

a venison pie as big as a house .

you !

oh , she was so beautiful - and i was so < u > ugly < /u > .

first , you desert me , and now you mock me . go back to your one-eyed friend .

a foolish wish . and you , quell ?

i am ergo the magnificent ... ... short in stature ... ... tall in power ... ... narrow of purpose ... ... wide of vision .

you do ?

no .

no ! not yet ! let me hug it and kiss it a little . let me run my fingers over its lovely skin . let me climb to the top and sing to it .

i ca n't hold the weight of both of you !

passable , pimple , very passable .

oh , my poor stew !

i must take the old man to see some sick children . kegan will guard you .

i am being exploited ! where are you going ?

surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison .

food for crows .

he is the king .

my spells always go wrong when i am observed . be gone !

he will come for me .

then look !

you knew ! you are a rude bumpkin !

i will tell you something you did not know , turold . had it been my choice , all those years ago , i would have chosen you for my king . but my parents chose otherwise .

yes .

we will hold . their power is not unlimited .

the attacks are unceasing : by night , the dark ones ; by day , those of our people who have sold themselves to them , those traitors who are called the slayers .

barak is still strong in the north , and tendo holds the high passes . but the great desert forts have fallen .

what news from our friends ?

sixty at the needle , another thirty in the forest . only ten of us made it back .

with an old voice ?

such a vision will be opposed . who seeks it ?

each to his fate . wait for me at the inn . if i am not back by dawn , you will know my fate , and you must go on without me .

knowledge i would n't want .

i can not stop the sand .

power you have given me . what can my power give you ?

yes .

yeah ... how do you know it ?

ok. mister stansfield , norman stansfield .

... i do n't know ... it 's true he touches me . i love him .

no ... not yet . he 's very shy ... and very sensitive .

come on , shit , tell me ! is he beautiful ?

she told them you wanted her things and that she was n't surprised police looked for you ! can you believe it ? !

yeah ... well ... i do n't know.. i do n't know any .

not at all , mathilda ! i tell you because it 's true ! you 'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose , ok ? we 'll go where you want ! i swear , you 'll see , mathilda ! !

you say it just to calm me !

it will take them five minutes ! how long ago did they arrive ?

what do you do , with the money you earn ?

... yes . the day he got out of jail . i allowed him to make ten steps ... no more . and bang . two hundred meters . by telescope . that night , i left my country and came here , to join my father , who worked for tony . ... i was 17. then , i never left the city ... and never had another girlfriend ...

then ? you did n't give a shit about her father , did n't you ? you met anyway ?

... i had a girlfriend ... a long time ago . before coming here , in my country . i was 14-year-old ... we flirted like kids ... her father did n't want her to meet me . my family was not very respectable .

i love you too , and i do n't want to lose you .

risky business , is n't it ?

yeah ... there 's a lot on tv .

... i prefer apartments ... furthermore , there are always kids in a building . what about getting some friends ?

... later .

there are better things . you see the importance of the `` moment '' . ten minutes early or late , he 'd have seen death . he 'd have suffered it . this way , he already departed . without knowing .

i think .

what shall we do ?

stop . everyone is looking .

well ... then may you rent me your gear for the day ?

may i go to the cinema ?

... because i feel it .

what 's up ? i do n't feel you 're concentrated .

yeah , but i did n't get him , i got his case and now he 's behind the tree . what can i do ?

good ! first shot !

the fat man down there , on the bench .

rocket launcher .

here , this is the light scoop for night shooting . there , you fix client 's distance ... how much to the bench down there in the park ?

ok , i 'm fine .

huh ? move back , baby , i ca n't see anything .

... i got lost , mister .

huh ! you made an error , baby . i do n't know any danielle .

huh , that 's good !

yeah , true . but what does your father exactly do for living ?

i 'm sick with practicing , that 's it ...

can i sit on the stairways now ?

ten dollars ... a month .

huh ? why ?

did you fish in messina ? the `` pesce spada '' ?

no ... dino 's .

yeah ... and still in messina . he 's my uncle .

giancarlo ... rinaldi .

... even his mother would n't .

this smells good .

where ?

i finish the walk , and then we may take all the chances we want .

then it 'll have to wait until i finish .

why did you take the back roads here ? they 're not safe . you 'd know that if you 'd planned .

i 'll make it .

it 's what she asked for ... it 's what i 'm going to do .

uncle maurice -- i spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here ... i have a rented car outside , just listen to me . come back with me now , and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we 'll plan a car trip across the country -- gerald and i will come along --

thank you .

look , i 'll see if anyone has spotted him recently . if i get any information , i 'll call you .

put out a p.b.s ... . or whatever it 's called .

that 's enough .

a wife ? ... did someone piss drunk run into your wife ? crushed her like a bug . snapped her bones ?

you need a ride , preacher ?

we operate . we find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding ... i just did this procedure on a senator and he 's doing fine .

you have ?

i 'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar .

pardon ?

so what 's the deal maurice ?

no really , if god takes us away from each other , you know where to look now ?

pacifica , california .

i do n't know .

face it ellen , i 'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories . but you love me anyway .

exactly . no reason . no occasion . it just makes you feel good to do something for it , to express your pride and affection for it some how ... how come you 'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me ?

you do n't think i love you ?

what it is -- is the truth .

... love is shown through actions not just words .

well , i 'm sure it 's not christmas , because you 'd be worried about how much money we do n't have to spend on each other ... i know it 's not new years , because you 'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you do n't like to dance ... and i 'm sure it 's not our anniversary , because i did n't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says , 'pick out something pretty ' ... yes -- maurice -- i 'm virtually certain it 's not a special day today .

it 's just a regular day .

i do n't want my wife 's soul having any doubts .

that 's a reasonable assumption .

do you believe a person 's soul lives on after their death ?

i asked the officers if you had committed some crime ... if they had said 'yes ' , you would be speaking with them right now .

thank you ... i 'm sorry you had to lie . it must have been difficult .

if i had seen you . by the way i 'm sorry about your wife . they told me .

jumped where ?

a marriage certificate ? who the hell carries their marriage certificate around ?

it 's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the steadman 's house .

not our problem .

if he 's in trouble with the law -- fine . not our problem . he yanked two people from a car wreck , let 's give him some space .

red flag , man .

right . but everyone saw how small isaac was and laughed ... but not big billy . he stared at isaac carefully and then told him to join the game . it came to the end of the game . it was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game ...

you know what ... maybe i ran onto the field and hit a home run .

oh no ... i 'm not good at that . very bad in fact ...

you tell stories ?

you know what ... i 'm just little now , but i 'll be big soon .

mammoth .

it 's mine to risk .

what , come on ?

you 're amazing .

she never ate a slice .

so i 've been informed .

pacifica , california ... that 's a long ways away .

walking where ?

when are you leaving ?

i want to reach people . nobody listens to me . this is my way to reach them .

never have children . if they 're not a burden to you , they 're a burden to someone else .

mr. parker , i 'm supposed to give you your fish sticks .

they told me , you might try to talk me into something ... you need to rest mr. parker ... it 's for your own good . i 've been following your story for a long while . it 's a beautiful thing you did .

you 're in pain .

do you have a car , steph ?

yes .

where did he go ?

forty-seven years .

is it a boy or a girl ?

he wants to reward you ... that 's why i 'm here .

this is my only chance to get a watch like that . it would mean a lot to me and my family . please take it . it really is n't that much .

i really want that watch .

everything 's ten dollars , and there 's no alcohol .

what do you want ?

oh , ben ... you look so very sick ... my love ... you 're so pale .

last spring i happened to walk past a house that i had once patronized . there was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window i could see a bare leg . the girl must have been taking a break between customers . it was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that i was late for something already i just stayed there , loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and ... the reason i 'm telling you this epilogue is that i felt that i 'd come full circle .

years ago , in la , i turned a trick on sunset and western . the guy was polite and did n't argue about the price . he parked his car and i took him to a house that i had an arrangement with . a fat mexican woman was watching a tv and i told him to give her the twenty for the room . there were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room . the room had a bed and a dresser . he lay on his back on the bed and i put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then i eased on to him . about twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up . i felt kind of guilty because he had n't come and i offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes , but he said it was all right and began dressing . when we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and ... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek . he gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car . i remember being relieved that i would n't have to work again that evening .

maybe i should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it 's like to sleep with you .

please !

i do n't understand any of that .

what was that all about ?

your color .

oh , and what did you do ?

well -- i was prepared for worse , but it was n't so bad . we were sitting at the bar , talking about blackjack . you seemed just fine , a little drunker than usual , but nothing really strange , but then your head started to droop and i put my arm on your shoulder and then , wham , you swung you arm at me , and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress . you smashed everything on her tray , it was a real mess . you kept yelling and yelling .

i 'm going to fill it right now .

i threw them into the garbage , which was perhaps immoral , but i wanted to come to you clean , so to speak . i thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day .

right ... the suitcase was clinking . so what did you do with your clothes ?

thanks , i do understand . i was worried about how that would be ... but now i 'm not . and you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job .

sera ... i hope that you understand how i feel about this . first of all , you 're welcome to my money . we can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest . but i do n't think you 're talking to me right now about money .

sorry .

sera ... what you do n't understand is ...

you have n't seen the worst of it . these last few days i 've been very controlled . i knock things over ... i throw up all the time . now i feel really good ... you 're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance , but that wo n't last forever . you 'll get tired of it really quickly . believe me .

me neither .

i do n't know . i 'll go and sort it out today . why do n't you come ? ... we 'll find a real room for me . you can pick it out , a tower on the strip .

sera ... you know i 'm not much good in the sack .

let 's face it , what the fuck are you doing in las vegas ?

what are you thinking ? are you angry with me ?

i like hearing you talk . if you feel up to a short walk , there 's a place to eat around the corner . all the food in vegas is terrible so the place does n't really matter . how does that sound to you ?

do n't know . my watch went the way of the car .

thank you . what time is it ?

yes . take your time . i 'm fine .

i have to change and take a shower first . if you want to come home and wait .

why should i ? i know you 're not a cop , so what is it tonight ? another two-fifty to watch you sleep ?

do n't run away .

no , i came here to drink ... myself ... you know ...

i do n't care about that . there 's time left . you can have more money . you can drink all you want . you can talk or listen . just stay , that 's all i want .

you were going to get my door .

right , i 'll get your door . i tend to fade in and out lately .

umm . we can stay in the car for an hour if you want . but i really have to go then . it 's your time .

no , this is fine . i was just wondering .

i 'm sort of curious ... if you 're willing to pay me two-fifty ... not that i mind ... i mean , i 'm ok with that -- why are n't you staying in a hotel ?

not really . my room 's not far . the whole year inn . you can drive with me if you want ...

is n't it illegal to drink and drive ?

hey ben . there were a couple of guys looking for you .

hey , brad ... how 's it going ?

yes , that would be great . are you her for the convention ?

yuri ... are you ...

go , sera . go . stay at home . i will call you tomorrow .

no .

it 's me , yuri .

all of it . i need to buy many things ... all of it !

yes , of course . how much do you need ?

where have you been staying ?

yes , but your major is fashion merchandising . harvard wo n't be impressed that you aced `` history of lycra '' . what are your backups ?

who ?

you 're fired . i have new representation .

i believe we are .

go to hell .

where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood .

is he always such an ass ?

he did leave a cher tape in the pool house once --

what 's going on ?

i 'm not having an affair with enrique -- you know a delta gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong ! i just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --

i know ! you helped me go from a six to a four !

sort of .

i 'm a delta gamma and i 'm a huge fan of yours !

uh , yeah , because the bitch shot him .

you , however , had time to hide the gun , did n't you , chutney ? after you shot your father ?

no . i was in the shower .

no , she 'd stashed it by then .

i saw brooke standing over his body , drenched in his blood .

i 'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it . that 's what makes a good lawyer . and on top of that , you gained the client 's trust and kept it . that 's what makes a great lawyer . you 're smart , elle . smarter than most of the guys i have on my payroll .

yes . but i ca n't tell you what it is .

all i know is -- it 's not brooke .

-- uh --

he chose them already ?

would you be willing to stake your life on it ?

you ca n't go home !

i could n't help it ! it was the most fun i 've had since i 've been in law school . not only was i good enough for warner -- i was better than him . he has to see serious i am now . even donovan was impressed , and he 's a total hard-ass .

is she ?

name ?

you 're pawning the rock ? !

you 're kidding !

i 'm still ca n't believe you did n't tell donovan the alibi .

oh , god , was this like an rsvp thing ?

oh , how sweet ! you made friends with a nerdy girl .

what ? !

picking out my wedding dress !

power yoga ?

it 's elle ! guess what i 'm doing right this second ?

why , yes , margot , i do . once again , we joined hope in the search for her identity . as you know , she 's been brainwashed by the evil stefano --

once warner sees me as a serious law student , he 'll want me back . it 's a completely brilliant plan !

so ?

thank you . i love you , too .

i do n't know ! everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more -- serious !

what if -- you know -- it 's not the night ?

i think you should go with red . it 's the color of confidence .

can someone please tell rick that he is not the only sigma chi with a big penis ?

what do you think ?

then , forget it . besides , i have an early class tomorrow .

oh , my god ! !

whoa -- why ?

i 'm quitting .

what ? !

for a butt-head ? yes .

what the hell is that for ?

the what ?

i ca n't believe you called me a butthead . no one 's called me a butt- head since ninth grade .

but maybe it is --

and make sure you read the footnotes in levinson 's class . that 's where all her exam questions come from .

donovan , royalton and levinson .

neat .

the professors ? yeah , they tend to do that . socratic method .

what 're you doing here ? !

how could this happen ?

what happened ?

i 'm canceling the mixer . we 'll blacklist sigma chi .

helloo ... he just had lunch with his grandmother . you know he got `` the rock '' .

maiden name -- daniels . you know her ?

it 's pink .

i 'd rather have a client who 's innocent .

why not ?

has warner huntington checked in yet ?

class schedule , map , book list .

really ?

it made me realize something . i 'm an idiot .

see ?

pink ones .

you look -- nice .

i just do n't want to see you get your hopes up . you know how you get .

but what ? we took the same lsat , we take the same classes --

elle , c'mon , there 's no way you 'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots . you 're not smart enough .

no , silly . i go here .

i told you , elle . i need someone -- serious .

elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --

that 's not entirely --

proposing ? ! elle , if i 'm going to be a politician , i need to marry a jackie , not a -- marilyn .

that 's why i think it 's time for us to --

you 're beautiful .

hovering ?

she 's naked .

i mean , i know you 're upset and all , but ca n't you just take a sedative ?

let 's all go ! road trip !

what 's the thing that always makes us feel better , no matter what ?

purely a precaution ...

we come watch ... we come watch ...

anything left for smashing you may happily smash .

then we smash 'em ?

fight 's over before it 's begun ... soon the survivors will be in full retreat .

indeed , the best of fun ... enjoy yourselves .

we watch ... good fun ...

dumb magic . giant smash peewee .

so you shall be ... like our brothers , the hawk and the wolf , our spirits know no master ... we are created in the pure image of the savage god that set our turbulent universe in motion .

or looked so beautiful ...

it 's nothing . my men take great delight in routing the enemy . do n't trouble yourself , beauty .

too bad your precious jack ca n't hear you ... the damsel in distress ... a rescue attempt would be most amusing ... we could flay sweet jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment ...

we 're both of us damned , my beauty .

damn you !

i know no more of shame than i do of fear . i wear this mask not for concealment but protection .

i am afraid of nothing .

god protect me .

i speak of love , and you think only of the lash .

your words sting more sharply than your whip .

flozen foleva not good .

then you 'll understand my quest . an ogre named blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn . the world outside is cursed , plunged into eternal winter . unless i return the alicorn , the earth will be frozen forever .

country fa ' fa ' away . to the east , beyond the lising sun ...

cathay ?

we be honored , friend ogg .

or was it the time you and jimmy squarefoot stole the golden apples i 'd forged .

friend ogg . excuse our enthusiasm , occasioned as it was by a fondness for you .

tis not the wound , that 's sure . not a scar remains ... we 're talking about a spell ; harder to repair than sword-work .

she lives like all the world before the baron 's curse lifted . now the world 's reborn , yet still she sleeps ...

were the princess lili to join me i would sing till my lungs burst !

listen to him . not in the mood ...

ride like wild fire , jack .

he 's getting away ! he was at my mercy !

seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead ...

patience , lad .

plan on carrying some away in a kettle ?

nay , lad , we 're here to collect a weapon you 'll need fighting the baron .

did you bring me here to sup ?

the kitchen be the most important room in a palace , for if the victuals ai n't right , little else is likely to be so .

sunlight , you say ?

because sunlight will kill him . quickly now , give me the key .

she 's sore hurt , jack , tis true , but not dead yet .

jack ! the courtyard 's been taken ... the baron 's forces are besieged in the south tower . no sign of ... jack ? do you hear what i 'm saying ? we 've won , lad .

aye . we 're good as inside .

best get down close to the moat , lad .

then it 's godspeed , screwball .

one more turn ...

there must be some way to get it up there .

will you chance a miss ?

faerie magic 's no match for a sorcerer 's power ... we have ogg 's gifts , the key and the --

there are n't enough arrows .

easily spoken ...

a fine mess this is ... horrid , nipping creatures ... what do we now , jack ?

wait , jack .

heading true north . we continue in that direction .

no , thank the lord , but she be sore envenomed by the spider 's bite .

what make ye of that , jack ?

make haste ! we 've a hard day 's march ahead .

very secretive , they are . keep their feet covered up . best if you do n't mention it .

dwarves be very sensitive about their feet .

ogg 's footprints !

your imagination runs away with you , jack ... those bones be but battlefield gleanings , like i mentioned . a wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited .

nay , jack , tis not what you 're thinking .

ofttimes , the wee folk come out to tend the wounded ... staunch bleeding with cobwebs ... give a parched mouth a sip of dew ... cool a fevered brow ...

the foulest . mayhap i can cut them free .

this is ogre 's magic .

good plan that .

beware .

aye . and hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying .

drop a mountain on him and we wo n't need our troops .

save your mischief for the black baron .

we 've no time for tricks this day , honeythorn gump .

it would appear so .

well then , you 've got the sword and you 've got the armor ; all 's lacking is the steed .

by the grace of god .

better we eat him than the other way round .

knaves and robbers ...

and who might that be ?

have we turned grave-robber , then ?

aye . black baron 's mischief .

will you lead me to her ?

how is it this hag knows the truth ?

that much magic i can offer ye , a small measure of entertainment at best . making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers .

why has this happened to the world ? why is it winter now , and dark ?

big question that , lad . why what ?

why , jack-lad , she likes you , is all . and what hot-blooded hero would n't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like oona here ... ? if your blood runs so cold , boy , you be a corpse before your time .

the flower . bluebells . to hear them ringing means your life 's at an end .

and if i can not ?

dance , jack ! the night 's but begun .

to be sure .

gump , is it ?

so , jack ... think you be a green man and not know gump .

very thrifty . even got your arrow back .

we seek to undo the curse .

ogg lives there ... ! and thurgis !

these chaps 'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth .

biting you ?

what 's the matter ?

lili ... i love you !

nay , dearest jack ... you are to be my husband . i want none other .

is what you said about the ring but another dream ?

no ! do n't let go ... you must n't ! i love you !

in the dark ... where i join him ...

so , he 's hiding in the dark ...

what ?

nay , jack , i 'm but wary of your intentions .

there 's no happier thought under heaven .

its powers are strong .

i do n't want it on me .

he did run ?

i do n't know . they 've hurt the unicorn .

shhh !

i 'm not its master .

oh , dear .

be patient .

a promise is a sacred oath .

it 's my father , gone a-hunting . the baron couer de noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport .

liar !

if you like .

thought the weather terrible of late .

far as you 're concerned she 's dead , believe it or not .

dead , dead , dead .

ask away , sweet man .

come sit beside me , sweet boy , and i 'll draw you a map .

not very precise directions .

where do i find the baron 's castle ?

how do i get the horn back ?

he chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot .

here be the death weapon ; the unicorn 's blood dry upon it .

aye . and it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here . i entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow , most lovely of the lovely .

you ... you ... you mortal you !

you are fair as the first new flower of spring ...

only that ?

i 'd be honored .

then , tis not for chastity ? methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night .

no fear of that now .

such a sad world , be there no unicorns to brighten it .

courage , jack .

your fond wishes give me strength , dear friends .

sorry , jack .

done like a champion . can you reach me with the line ?

where ?

we wait .

i know where to find him ... he lies out on the marsh , raven-fodder ; his horn torn from his head .

you 're well equipped , i 'd say . legendary arms ...

sigurd the volsung slew fafnir with that blade ... see the line where regin welded the break ?

the avatar . i like the sound of it .

how came you by this blade ?

each fit for a hero ... my uncle fashioned a hammer for thor . twas he named it mjolnir . grandfather forged excalibur ... you wo n't ever see finer craftsmanship .

it be the castle ... we feel the castle ... it be that close ...

castle couer de noir built with magic ... simple as death ... strong as hate ...

the black baron , you say ?

with dale . oh , and i got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through !

i 'm not cheating ! i 'm not looking !

marco !

he 's not there .

that 's how you get things right is to always try and never give up . huh , mom ?

and video games after !

since seventh grade .

sam !

i woke up this morning at three and could n't fall back asleep . everyday i think i see more of sam than i 've seen in years .

i love red ! that 's my favorite color !

i would have anyway .

uh ... using josh like that .

what are you doing up so early ?

and why was the alarm on ?

i could n't get it to go down .

i put him to work .

let 's shut up and not kill her .

i 'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer , i 've decided .

my keys .

nope .

why ?

he seems lonely .

i 'll survive .

floating to catalina .

he asked where you were ! he wants you with him .

you 're off , you know ? you 're way , way off .

you 're driving me crazy ! do you know what it 's like trying to jack-off in an armoire ?

josh said ...

we 're not gon na do anything .

this is serious ! i do n't have my license . he was my ride .

not really . no . kinda . he got busted ?

i wanted him to marry her .

i 'll get your back .

tell him i said `` hi '' .

your dad 's really gon na build his house ?

where to ?

i 'm hungry ! where 's my dinner ? who ate my dinner ? huh ? who 's in trouble now ?

no .

will he talk to me ?

he 's not the type to worry .

you 're so nice to let sam use your shower .

months .

well , if it is , we have a problem .

i flushed it down the toilet .

well , i feel better about this now .

i was a sophomore when i got the call my parents were dead .

forty .

that 's too long .

well , that 's sort of ... you 're sure you 're not hungry ?

peter webber ! right . quite the spotlight on that guy .

when we divorce a decade ago , she was very , very angry . now she 's just hostile .

how 's your wife ?

oh ... do you know when she 'll be home ?

my life is a warning . i just ca n't figure out for what .

you were the only neighbor i could tolerate .

the plumber 's due out on friday .

hey , it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer .

i 'll ask .

the whole summer , man . party in tahoe .

here .

the kind where there is n't really an answer .

what 's wrong with your back ?

that 's so weird ...

do n't be . and hide whatever that new drug is you have . i like it .

what would you be doing now ?

i 'm telling you now .

nothing .

i like how it feels not to feel .

i know . why ?

i took some of your vicodin .

i 'm not even listening .

i 'll have to pay him back .

the game was to make me smaller than he was . no matter what . he could be almost invisible as a human being , but i had to be smaller . so if i got good grades , i was a pussy for not playing football . if i cut my hair for him , it was n't short enough . if i shaved it , i looked like a psycho . i never won the game . not once . and if he could n't make me smaller with words ...

a friend of yours is here .

oh , okay .

where are you going ?

i 'm leaving .

i can promise you complete privacy .

and i do n't take a shower in the middle of the yard .

i do n't know .

your brothers are right . it was the most god-awful smell i 've ever had my nose around .

i almost saw catalina .

your nose ring comes out of your nose . if you 've got them in your nipples , they come out , too . and there 's no make-up at my house . no glue sniffing . huffing . no pills , no grass .

mom ... please .

you do n't have a choice .

who are you , anyway ? i do n't even know you .

i can die trying .

no one 's really said four months is all you have , have they ?

you know what mortise and tenon is ?

it 's my day off . i thought i 'd help with the plumbing .

at least your father tried , george .

it was in my name so he would n't lose it . he stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title .

i aimed high .

she 's a little sad , is all .

because dad left ?

it 's okay .

i just wanted to know where mom was ?

not a perfect day .

do n't move !

it 's not my back that 's killing me .

so could i .

what did he say ?

left you ?

is your back still killing you ?

you need to know what ? do i still love you ?

you 've never said that before .

when i picked you up from the train station ... what you said .

i can hire workers to help me .

oh , i 'm worse . much , much worse .

you 're a good mother .

you brought your kids ?

my stupid back .

i thought you 'd be up with the sun .

with your hands or your tongue ?

the antibiotics were n't working . it 's what i believe , george .

the only time i can think of for sure , i was holding onto sam in the ocean , saving him from the waves .

i do n't even like turkey sandwiches . what kind of pizza ?

i was here six years . and i only hated two .

but you hated four out of the five you did .

it makes me sad .

well , for later then .

he 's not spending the entire summer with another kid in tahoe . if he leaves , i will follow him up there and i will drag him home by his nose ring . he can hate me . you can hate me . he can try to kill me while i sleep . you can call the police . you can call your husband or your attorney , but sam is spending the summer with me . he 's my son . he 's sixteen . that 's it .

no . i was going to let you do that .

you and sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer ?

i love those doors .

severance pay . and i 'm going to cash in my life insurance policy .

there 's nothing anymore to stop me .

why call me ?

what ?

why does he have a lock on his door ?

he never answers .

lock the door behind you .

you let him pierce his nose ?

i could use the money .

i 'm thinking it 's too weird now .

you got the money ?

nothing .

been thinking ?

what the fuck ?

i 'll be in the bedroom .

sam took them to a movie .

you live a fabulous life , robin .

i was talking about our marriage .

you ca n't go with me because of sam ?

we have n't been away together for three years . what difference does a few months make ?

i 'm helping george build his house .

lois will stay with them . or we can pawn them off on your parents .

do you remember anything i 've said that was n't negative ?

is lois still here ? i 'm starved .

do you like red ?

are you wearing eye shadow ?

i 've missed you guys .

hey .

i did n't go in your room .

dad 's home , already ?

would you stop being ridiculous ? your father wants sam home as much as i do .

adam , that 's not true !

i just thought it would be nice .

he 'll be gone for his birthday .

better make it a week .

that 's my girl .

nagger ?

it 's a boy ! well , let 's get a look at him .

she 's doing just fine .

not for me , it ai n't .

i 'm talking about a haircut .

i did , claude . i mentioned you . i mentioned you both . but the fact is , pardons do n't come cheap . the kid can hit . what can you do ?

yeah , but what about me and ray ? i did n't see our names on that pardon . you said you were gon na put in a good word for us .

kid 's getting out . i got him a pardon .

there are ways around that . right sergeant ?

maybe you did n't notice , but this is a prison .

ca n't get right ? that 's the kid 's name ? can i talk to him ?

i look good tonight . and i feel lucky , too .

is spanky here ?

want me to come back some other time ?

she always said that if you were on the outside ...

yeah .

claude , mind helping me to the bathroom ?

goodnight , claude .

it 's a hell of a lot longer when you 're innocent .

that 's alright , boss . takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings .

comfortable ?

i do n't see no wedding ring , banks . conjugal visits are for married prisoners only .

yeah , that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains . i hope he do n't mess things up .

claude . that 's my name . claude . that 's never happened before .

are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here ?

remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day ? more beautiful than any church i was ever in .

well , ruth shoulda built it a little better . damn thing 's falling to pieces . gon na hurt somebody .

sure would like to see the house that ruth built one more time .

do n't make me take them away from you .

i ai n't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride .

claude , man , i 'm serious . give me those keys .

go where , ray ?

come on , man , i 'm starting to cramp up here . we have the chance right here , right now , i say we go !

then you 're lucky i came along . does n't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this . now help me out of this trunk .

greenville . we 're picking up the new superintendent at the bus station .

you have n't driven in 40 years , you ai n't even got a license . man 's taking his life in his hands , putting you behind the wheel ! where you taking him ?

goodnight , ray .

bullets were n't the problem . that pie was too hot . burned my tongue .

i ai n't getting in no airplane with you . i 'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept . they threw us in this shithole for life . do n't you get it , ray ? we 're gon na die here ! might as well head up to the cemetery , pick a plot and start digging .

crop duster .

he said they keep it parked out behind the barn . ca n't be that hard to fly a plane . lots of people do it .

it 's a pardon from the governor .

do n't matter who camp 12 puts on the mound . all i know is when this season 's over camp 8 's gon na have pork chops .

ketchup ? who eats ketchup on a hot dog ? mustard 's what you want .

you get ketchup ?

i know people .

sure , it says allie reynolds right here in the program . he 's warming up right now . man , we 're so close to the field i need cleats . how 'd you get such good seats ?

red sox ... who 's on the mound ?

hundred and sixty first street ? that 's yankee stadium .

the hell you talking about ? what train ?

he 'd be doing me a favor . i 'm getting outta here one way or the other ! goddamn rats and shit ! fuck !

hell , you 'd probably be half way to new york by now ...

do n't mention it .

let me take a look at that map .

do n't call me that . you know i hate it when you call me that .

i said you 're soft .

i do n't think so , claude . you 'd just slow me down . we 'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware . there 's no way around it , you 're soft .

come on , man . do n't shut me out . i 'm telling you , you and me , that map , we can go places .

well , let 's just think about that for a moment . he 's a successful lawyer up in new york city and you 're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business . eeny , meeny , miney , maynard .

the appeal was denied . then daisy went and fell for maynard . they 're engaged to be married , can you believe that ?

cut the bullshit . what do you want , claude ?

my daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet .

what do i want ? what makes you think i want something ?

gim me that . that does n't concern you .

maynard banks , esquire . attorney at law .

what does that mean ?

you want out of this place , do n't you ? do n't tell me you 're starting to like it here .

why are you always talking about we ? there is no we . there is a me , there is a you . but there is no we between us .

wait up there , claude . you give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you 'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails .

no , man . i want you to have it .

this fork is filthy .

he does it all by himself .

life ? ! how long is life ? we were just walking back to the truck . we did n't do nothing ! fuck life !

would you look at that , ray . winston up and died on us .

come on , ray , better get winston back to the truck .

he 's dead .

that jelly you were talking to right here ?

well , not exactly . see , i met this girl . real nice girl . god-fearing girl . her name 's sylvia .

hey , ray . i 've been looking for you .

look , ma'am , we 've been driving all day . we 'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we 'll be on our way .

looks like a fake to me . loan denied !

my daddy is dead so watch your mouth . you can say what you want about me , but do n't be dragging my daddy into it . this watch means the world to me . solid gold . keeps perfect time .

my daddy gave me this watch .

how would i get a loan , anyway ?

at some point a man 's got to get serious about his future . i 'm sure you have no idea what i 'm talking about .

hey , you 'd be surprised what you find in other people 's pockets . just got ta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers . get you every time .

nothing .

that 's some long green .

come on , daddy-o . you have n't said a word since we started . least you could do is make some friendly conversation .

good , i 'm looking forward to meeting this spanky . give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess .

probably to spanky 's headquarters down at the pier .

you went to monroe ?

soft and supple . like a lady 's .

then you wo n't have no problem making the adjustment . you need anything , help of any kind , gim me a holler . name 's jangle leg .

i 'm all right .

how about some steak sauce ?

you got your own nightclub ?

alright , well , let 's say you make it to greenville . what 's there , anyway ?

that 's right . we do n't need no fences , we have the gun line . it runs from shack to shack clear around the yard . you are now inside the gun line ...

new york . that 's up north , ai n't it ? they 'll find we do things different down here .

he 's from new york city . that one , too .

listen up , jiggaboo ! state of mississippi ai n't interested in your ... in your ... metropolitan assets !

c'mon , goldmouth , somebody 's got ta watch the front door .

hey , ray ...

that 's right , fellas . catch any cab heading uptown . all the drivers know ray 's boom-boom room .

hell , no ! i just got something in my eye .

what happened to 'em after that , willie ?

that musta messed 'em up pretty bad .

do n't argue with me . you need it more than i do . i know how a little money can help in a place like this .

i heard some things so i went to see spanky johnson . he told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here . what happened to your face ?

i 'm going in for him . he 'd do the same for me .

he must still be in there .

is there any truth to what he 's saying , pike ?

he 's crazy . do n't listen to him , wilkins .

if somebody deserves respect , mr. pike , they receive it from me , convict or no convict .

if you do n't mind my saying , you seem mighty familiar with your house boy .

you do n't have to twist my arm . say now , that gumbo has quite a kick .

that watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me . it meant the world to me .

like you shot winston hancock ?

i oughta shoot you for that comment , boy .

must have been some time ago . maybe forty years ?

why , my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back .

satchmo .

who ?

what 's the boom boom room ?

what are you in for , willie ?

maybe we will . nice meeting you .

blacks welcome there ?

you found him .

what 's that , some of your bathtub brew ?

you do n't have to drown that fella , spanky . you already scared him half to death . he did n't know who he was fucking with .

is this a joke ?

how about this ? i stay here enjoying my schnapps and you go back .

you should n't have come here .

i was going to let you out , eventually , cassius . i swear .

hello , cassius .

brilliant . this is so much fun . i never want it to end .

i lowered the drinking age to ten .

it 's our time , brother .

you saying we go up there and kill everyone ?

it 's just such a slap in the face .

and he 's dead serious .

noon ...

well , mommy , get me to the big apple cause i 'm gon na rock that town like a hurricane .

what is it ?

stronger , yes . smarter , definitely . but you have something he does n't have .

it was a long time ago , at some heaven and hell mixer .

unh-huh . which would make you half angel .

an angel ?

my mom was n't a goat ?

a mountain goat ? that 's really sweet .

okay , can i just ask you something ? what do you know about your mom ?

they castrated him . he ca n't shoot arrows , he ca n't piss smoke .

no .

what 's nicky doing down there ?

release the evil ?

you have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil , bat 's blood , moose piss . you just have to release the evil within you .

`` but those are my roommate 's sodas ... '' does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make ?

you ca n't do jack shit ... unless you learn your evil powers .

okay , just point me in the right direction next time .

this is intense ! and it happens every day ? sometimes twice ? i got ta tip my hat to you people !

that pain is hunger .

i also have this odd pain in my mid section . kind of a hollow feeling ...

okay , `` bro , '' this jig is up ... just get in the bottle . just slide right on in there .

sure , pop . whatever you want .

please , pop , just go back to your room .

last time you said that the renaissance happened .

yeah , but joe was coming here anyways . just go back to earth and enjoy your records and the hall of fame and the beautiful family and all that .

now he 's got no ears ! you happy , nicky ? your father 's got no ears !

nicky , i let my butterflies die once upon a time and it 's never stopped hurting . that 's right , you heard me , holly . i 'm still in love with you .

i came through for you , mom and the butterflies , dad .

uh , i 'll do my best , dad . do you have any advice at all for me ?

dad , adrian 's got the whole city after me . he 's always a step ahead . what am i gon na do ?

please , nicky , get back up there . try to hurry .

that 's a train , son . do n't stand in front of them .

son , just do your best .

i 'm too weak . the process has already begun .

so go get 'em , dad !

definitely .

beast .

you got it . could you maybe not tell anyone about this ?

that 's nice , grandpa . why do n't you just enjoy the fishing ?

his name is andrew . i know that guy .

no .

see ya , fellas .

whoa , that chick must be the real deal , then . later on .

absolutely nothing . the blizzard always came straight with his messages . but wrap your minds around this one .

which way did he go ?

you keep a bat under your seat ?

i followed him all the way downtown , and when he gets out of the car , i reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat .

you followed him ?

i 'll just go to heaven .

dude . seriously ?

please . you got to .

you got the wrong window again , man .

thanks , much . good luck with the genital tucking .

it 's `` comptoir sud pacific . '' makes me feel like a hula girl . which is kinda what i 'm going for . wan na come in ?

i love you .

from my dad 's side of the family .

... '' the devil ? `` ...

valerie ?

what were you thinking coming here ?

you know what 's nice about you ? you just seem happy being yourself . you do n't try to act cool .

basically , yeah .

good . i was concerned .

parsons school of design . i knew growing up i was n't much to look at , so i put my energy into making things that are pretty .

you have a dog ? what kind ?

i do n't know .

it 's like eighty degrees in this hallway . you from the south ?

off limits .

see something you like , my man ?

hey ...

shut up ! shut up your damn mouth !

i feel sorry for you , boy !

i cut up a sandman yesterday . they said i 'd never get him ... but i cut him up good , i did .

how do you want us ?

that 's better . how do you want us ?

there must be somebody else up here . i ca n't believe that he 's --

you 're a beautiful pair .

where do we go ? ! where do we go from here ? ? ! !

hiding ? yes ! hiding , hiding .

we were sent here and you know it . others have been sent here . where are they ? hiding ?

we 're hungry do you have anything to eat ?

all right -- what are you ?

hurry ... hurry ... hurry .

just the face .

i did n't do anything , francis ! they 've made us believe that ...

who invited you ?

i never even visited nursery before tonight . when you wonder , it slows you up -- you know ?

why ?

you are here . i could n't believe it when they told me . what are you doing ?

holly . holly ! please ... the other sandman . remember the one who came after --

no , holly -- wait ! he 's running . tell them the rest !

you 're lying ! you 'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything ! you 'll be killed the moment you 're seen !

there 's a sanctuary ... there is !

yes , do you think that 's why he looks so sad ?

then the answer 's yes ...

of course .

thirty thousand years did n't last very long , did they ?

maybe we 're the first ones to get through ... maybe sanctuary is near , now ... another protected place . it could n't be outside .

for us .

i do n't know what 's going to happen to us logan but -- are you glad you did n't kill him ?

some kind of breeding pens ... i suppose ... they say people used to breed animals , fish , anything ... ... to eat , of course .

it 's the only way .

will you take me with you ?

they 're watching us now . they 'll let us in when they 're sure .

they wo n't believe us .

because he 's my friend -- and i do n't want to be killed by him -- or anyone .

yes . i do n't know what else to do -- with him following us . why do you keep running from your --

are you taking me to them ?

i -- i ca n't .

muscle ? i do n't know that one .

the cubs . when they 're flying on muscle there 's no way to catch up . without the dazzle , they 'd just go past us -- -- too fast

but what is this -- why ?

just follow -- no matter how it seems ...

i 'm only telling you what i 've heard ... have n't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was like ... ?

that 's nice .

if you trusted me , you 'd know .

maybe you 'll think of something ...

that 's tomorrow .

are you here to help me ?

and i never heard of sanctuary .

how can i ?

both ... running 's what i 'm interested in .

you can have any woman in the city . what do you really want ?

i 'm the most beautiful woman you 've ever seen , i suppose ?

but i was n't sure you 'd come .

you 're sure you do n't want to try ?

six . i go red next year .

i 'm not armed . well ?

how a sandman lives .

i changed my mind .

i thought i had to do something .

but you put yourself on the circuit !

later .

i never 'killed ' anybody in my life . sandmen terminate runners . who brought you ?

killed ? why do you use that word ?

well then ... ?

goodbye .

we 'll have to bury him .

what people ?

all this . all of it .

no .

are you sure ?

yes , cats , of course . what else could they be ? cats . of course each one has his own name too .

a sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else . where 's the doctor ?

we do n't get many sandmen . i think we 've only had one other since i 've been here .

oh my ... i 'll try .

i know ... we 're going to try and get in this way . i do n't think you can make it .

that 's better than gold when it 's cold .

and all alive you say ?

more ... many more .

not yet .

are you ready to put him in ?

never , never , ever . nothing .

dead ... they 're dead ... and buried .

where are they ?

are there any other humans ?

for as long as i can remember .

how long have you been living here ?

someone will follow . when you come to the lock , he will tell you how to go on the other side . jessica may go with you as far as the lock .

too little .

pile in .

you want somethin ' ?

sheila 'll be at `` tops '' .

good ... you up for a drive ?

why not ?

how i remember them . not necessarily the way they happened .

this is our bedroom .

i do n't know if i want to stay here . i do n't feel safe .

we 'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled .

do you own a video camera ?

the angle . the high angle shot on the tape .

you know what i think ?

what a fuckin ' job .

yeah ... laurent .

or something .

look at all this shit ... i know a fence ... he 'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car ... we can go anywhere .

up the stairs - down the hall .

where 's the bathroom ?

you got him .

are you gon na be a man about this , pete ?

are you kidding ? ... i 've got so much on andy , it is n't funny .

i 'll set it up for tomorrow night . you 'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock ... do n't drive there ... take a bus ... make sure no one follows you ... his address is easy to remember ... it 's 2224 deep dell place ... it 's a white stucco job on the south side of the street ... i 'll be upstairs with andy ... the back door will be open ... that leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there 's a bar there ... at eleven fifteen , i 'll ask andy to fix me a drink ... when he does , you can crack him in the head ... okay ?

you liked it .

no ... a job ... i did n't know what . he set up an appointment for me to see a man .

in pornos ?

he makes films for mr. eddy .

he works for mr. eddy .

i 'm not positive ... but ... he knows .

pete ?

i think he suspects something ... we have to be careful ... i miss you .

sure .

okay ...

yeah ... call me at home . i 'll give you the number .

can i call you ?

okay , then , i 'll take you to dinner .

i was here yesterday .

he is ? i did n't think you knew dick . how do you know he 's dead ?

dick laurent ?

mr. eddy 's called every day ... can i call him to come in ?

we 're not saying anything about that night to the police . we should all forget that night .

what is this ? why did n't you tell me ? what ? ... i do n't remember any of this .

sheila ?

i got ta headache ... what 's goin ' on ?

sit down .

hey .

you talk to him ?

did you ask him who he is ?

yeah , mack ?

what about yesterday ?

when he went to work , right .

i do n't know yet .

what is this , rogoff ?

no .

i ... i did n't say anything ...

what did you say ?

did you use the alarm system since we were here last ?

no ... there is , i mean , i use it as a practice room ... it 's soundproofed .

what 's bothering you , madison ?

my ... my head .

where 's alice ?

that 's absurd .

of course . in fact , i 'm there right now .

now ! we 're leaving now ! i did n't want to come here in the first place .

but ...

let 's go home .

just a minute .

but that does n't solve the problem . who is doing this ? and why ?

where would you feel safe ?

no , i do n't remember anything . it looks like i ... but ... i do n't remember .

on the tape ! there was something else on the tape .

what the hell is going on ? !

two detectives are coming out .

what 's that ? another tape ?

called ? when ?

i called , you know .

maybe .

who 's it from ?

what 's that ?

the heart , i guess .

how could i miss it ? the tv wo n't quit with that stuff .

yeah .

who is this ?

hello .

suit yourself , champ .

yeah . give ya a boner .

fifteen car lengths . about two hundred and seventy feet .

sorry about that , pete , but tailgating is one thing i ca n't tolerate .

give that a try .

because if anybody 's givin ' you trouble , pete , i can take care of the problem ... like that .

what 's goin ' on ?

no . no , i do n't .

you fuck me whenever you want ... you do n't call ... tell me who she is .

where 'd you come from ?

i do like you , sheila .

nothin ' ... you want to go for a drive ?

sure . sure i do .

whatiya mean ?

you sure were n't acting like the pete dayton i 've always known .

i do n't remember ... what happened that night ?

what are you guys doin ' ?

yeah .

let me have it . `` aboard the s.s. manchuria . last night conway seemed to recover his memory . kept talking about shangri- la , telling a fantastic story about a place in tibet . insisted upon returning there at once . locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at singapore . am leaving ship myself to overtake him , as fearful of his condition . wrote down details of conway 's story about shangri-la which i am forwarding . lord gainsford . ''

thank you .

oh my , is n't that pretty ! what is it ?

this does n't obligate me in any way .

so that 's where you are . i might of known it . no wonder you could n't hear me .

hey lovey , come here ! lovey , i asked for a glass of wine and look what i got . come on , sit down .

horns ? what kind of horns ?

horns ?

sounds like a stall to me .

colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you , the swindler of thousands of people

believe me , it 's no fun . when you fellas picked me up at baskul , they 'd been on my tail for a year .

thinking ? what about some double solitaire ?

uh-huh . you 're a scream , lovey .

do you think they 're cannibals ?

where are they ? do you see them ?

all right , all right . keep quiet .

of course . that 's what i told them last night . you ca n't expect a man to sail around in the dark . [ 5 ] during this george has been looking around - he rises .

now you 're irritating and absurd !

well , you just reverse it . your left hand is what difference does it make what 'hand ' you are ? the north is the north !

oh , really ?

that 's ridiculous .

why , of course . yes .

wait a minute . is it a good morning ? say , we 're supposed to be traveling east , are n't we ?

okay , brother .

yeah , i remember . you said that before .

i beg your pardon , brother . what did you say you were hunting ?

you see ? you get the idea ? from this reservoir here i can pipe in the whole works . oh , i 'm going to get a great kick out of this . of course it 's just to keep my hand in , but with the equipment we have here , i can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there . can rig it up in no time . do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water ?

yes . unbosom yourself , mr . hyde . [ 11 ]

please ! please ! do not wait for me ! i eat so very little .

hey , hurry up , you slow-pokes - i 'm starved !

that 's what i say . what do you say to a rubber of bridge ? i saw some cards in the other room .

well , there 's nothing we can do until the morning .

look , honey . we run the pipes through here , and we connect with the main water line here .

why , you look beautiful .

oh , no - you do n't want to go yet , honey . she 'll stick around too . is that right ?

well - i 'm

i think i 'll stick around . i 'll leave with the porters on their next trip .

when are you going to start ?

yes . i 've just been talking with the porters . they 're going to take us . we 've got clothing , food , everything . come on !

look , bob !

over by that hill .

i ca n't let him go alone . it 's suicide !

oh , she 'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age .

and he can arrange for the porters to take us back ?

the only one .

one moment . you say the high lama is the only one who can give us any information ?

then everything is quite all right , is n't it ?

why , mr. conway , you surprise me !

and very true . your lives are therefore , as a rule , shorter , not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide .

oh , no . just a little bowled over , that 's all .

108 and still active ?

that , my dear conway , is the story of a remarkable man .

i see . gold for ideas . you know mr. chang , there 's something so simple and naive about all of this that i suspect there has been a shrewd , guiding intelligence somewhere . whose idea was it ? how did it all start ?

centuries .

they were .

you have no disputes over women ?

oh , good heavens , no !

so there are others ?

where is your mad pilot ?

please calm yourself . you 'll soon be well if you do .

i 've offered you some warm broth . i thought perhaps-

now , what would you like to do ?

yes .

amazing , mr. chang . this place is amazing ! and that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent . oh , i 've looked around . i 've seen everything . your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very , very happy .

the high lama ! who in blazes is he ? !

you know , it 's very , very strange , but when you saw me in the corridor , i was actually on my way to you . i bring the most amazing news . the high lama wishes to see you , mr. conway .

no porters here ! !

now , my dear boy . you should n't

oh , yes . there is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here . that is our only contact with the outside world . every now and again , depending upon favorable weather of course , they make the journey .

in that event , we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately . some means to get us back to civilization .

hey !

no , mr. conway , i 'm not lying . what reason could i have for lying ? the chances are that we 'll never come out of that horrible trip alive , but i 'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive , than to stay here one more minute now .

yes .

are n't you afraid to leave ? you do n't want to look like an old woman , do you ?

father perrault is dead .

i thought the porters had instructions from the high lama not to take anyone .

are you the high lama ?

sit here , near me . i am an old man and can do no one any harm .

i have waited for you , my son , for a long time . i have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers . i have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that i might find you . my friend , it is not an arduous task that i bequeath , for our order knows only silken bonds . to be gentle and patient , to care for the riches of the mind , to preside in wisdom , while the storm rages without .

because , my son , i am placing in your hands the future and destiny of shangri-la . for i am going to die .

you must not look to me for help . your brother is no longer my problem . he is now your problem , conway .

as long as they keep on aiming at us , we 're safe . come now , child .

was saying

you say the porters are waiting for us ?

she was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were , bob .

you 're wrong , george .

because you ca n't . do you know what will happen to her if she leaves shangri-la ? she 's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved . take her out of this valley and she 'll fade away like an echo .

i 'd go mad !

besides , i - i do n't feel like making that trip alone , bob .

oh , george . . .

enough ! never mind the girl ! well , why do n't you go ?

you 've got to talk about it . what about me ? you said they stole that plane to bring you here . i did n't want to come . you owe me some responsibility .

it 's no place for you , bob . think of what 's waiting for you . do you want to stay here until you 're half dead ? until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them ?

i do n't need any proof .

i will , george . i want to tell you . i 'll burst with it if i do n't . it 's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable , but so beautiful ! well , as you know , we were kidnapped and brought here . . .

you ca n't leave , george .

what about the porters ?

george , come back !

george , what do you think you 're doing ?

i 'm afraid the porters are just a myth . i guess we never will know why we 're here , or how long we 're going to be held prisoners .

nothing about the porters yet ?

well - i heard that if you want a man 's wife , she 's yours , if he 's got any manners .

that 's what 's on the other side of the hill .

uh-huh .

well - i mean

of course you would . if ever we get out of this place , the thing for you to do is to take that job with helen 's father .

what are you talking about ?

hello , george . cigarette ?

what 's it mean ?

dead ?

it looks like it . smell those fumes ?

i do n't know . i ca n't get the dialect .

oh , stop it !

how i 'm going to bask in reflected glory ! people are going to point to me and say , `` there goes george conway - brother of the foreign secretary . ''

you ?

right , bob .

bob ! i think i hear motors !

i do n't know . he must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from fenner . when he lands , we 'll find out .

what if he refuses ?

no . that 's not possible ! if we had landed , we all would have been awakened .

i 've thought about it for years . i knew you 'd come . and i knew if you did - you 'd never leave . am i forgiven for sending for you ?

well , everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself , accumulate a nest egg , and so on .

beautiful ! i 'm waiting for the bump .

then it would n't be a garden spot for long .

i wonder .

father perrault ! i envy you . i talked to him last night .

there are so many questions i 'd like to ask you , i hardly know where to begin .

oh , i know . it was full of this and full of that . but you were accomplishing nothing . you were going nowhere , and you knew it .

i saw a man whose life was empty .

you suggested my being brought here , did n't you ? what gave you the idea i 'd fit in ?

yes . barney !

why , he 's speaking english .

please say you will . the days are so very long and lonely without you . please . . .

perhaps .

i 'm sorry . i have n't even got any cigarettes left !

oh , you 'll still , be guarding him .

no . just peace on earth .

... touch that .

cowan --

the hell were you thinking ?

i 'm not talking about that . i 'm talking about your choice of targets .

so ... wait . you just asked ... but he goes so fast , he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it .

hang on . -- and this is the good part ; when you 're fully ordained , he 'll come when you call him , too . dave .

mrs. edelson ?

they do n't ?

yes , air . but i 'm usually wrong . sir .

home ? you got ta be kidding me . black ?

dee , you 've been useful for 50 years . we 're clueless , you 're tired . why do n't you go home and get some rest .

helluva night , is n't it ?

little more burn on the perimeter-they were n't roasting smores here . dig out this hole a little . cmon , i know it 's late , but the sooner we get it right , the sooner we 'll all be home .

what ? i thought you just --

i 'd go with number three .

actually that 's a very good question . the answer -- if you 'll just look at this part -- is here .

sir --

vayanse . you others , go on .

we 'll take it from here .

oh no , i ca n't do this job by myself .

not her . me . they 're beautiful , are n't they ? the stars . i never just look anymore and they 're beautiful .

who 's she gon na tell , anyway ? she only hangs out with dead people .

you coulda told me what you were doing .

in case i need it ?

do his job .

i 'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel . you guys get to the memorial . keep this stuff hidden . the last thing we need is some over-zealous secret service twirp to ...

well , if the bugs have hatched , and they 're not here ... then where are they ?

we saw it in the office . it went from this big ... to big ... in a day .

for how long ?

yes . well , in his own mind , yeah . what if , from his point of view , he is ?

he 's here to help ! ?

kay --

oh , yeah ? fill us in , why do n't you .

i dunno , man . maybe we should .

where 's it coming ? where 's he landing ?

and what 's this ... ?

i dunno . maybe it was baby supplies , kay starts the car , starts to pull a u-turn .

um -- kay ?

i taught kindergarten .

you do n't know the half of it .

i think she 's the alien . in any case , she 's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room .

i know , but we 're on a college campus ...

it 's the way we do it . the way we 've always done it .

but not a bug bug -- it 's an insect .

it 's a bug .

i understand . hey , it works for the hasids , right ? no one recognizes them .

well , how about if i guess , then ? black : vast space . deep . spiritual . the essence of infinity .

me , too . i feel a long day coming on .

the only thing i could think of would be ... you 'd have to get rid of the queen .

i swear to god , that was not here two days ago ...

i do n't think so . i mean , him , he could be a scientist , maybe . but you ... exterminator , i 'd understand . but entopolgist ? no way .

actually , you may have .

so ... how 'd you hear about this ?

actually , they disgust me . but that 's what i love about them . like a car wrack , you know , how you should n't look , but you always pull over and watch real close , or even pretend you 're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures ?

i understand . i understand , thank you . -- how about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser ?

goodwill ...

no -- a person is smart . people are dumb . and the more people you put together , the dumber they get . and you know that .

pardon me . i hate to break up this lovely little group hug , but we people are n't ready for what we have . how is this going to help ?

oh yeah ? well if you 're suddenly such a good samaritan , why did n't you file a departure report , like you 're supposed to ? you know how many rules you 've just broken ?

yeah , wall , you know , i was just going there ... to pick then up .

er . well , nowhere special .

nothing at all ? now ? last month ? anything in the last few years ?

i promised i would n't tell .

they 're not my pals --

really nice wheels , by the way .

the what ?

this it ?

how 'd you know ?

yeah ? what 's up ?

i 'm getting a trajectory ...

if i may , sir ... what exactly are you offering ?

what --

the other two will die without me .

i have to go back .

he wo n't .

agatha --

agatha ...

i 'm so sorry ... i just want him back ... i want him back so bad ...

then who was he ?

-- go blind . i know .

i know you 're in a hurry , so i juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes .

i ca n't even stand up --

so uh , if you were a plastic surgeon before ...

you made those tapes ...

i put you away --

whatever you say , john .

anesthesia . try to relax , john . i 'm saying i 'll have to remove your eyes . completely .

right . i know --

that 's comforting .

so she cleaned up . where is she now ?

just tell me about the intended victim . this anne lively ...

why 's he still a john doe ? why was n't he ever id 's from an eyescan ?

you the only sentry ?

drowning .

yes , sir . i 'm gideon . the music relaxes the prisoners .

people want to believe in the system . that 's the beauty of it ...

john --

i 'm not getting halo 'd .

i ca n't . they 're following me right now . they 'll meet me there . they 'll halo me .

all right , john , just take a breath , let 's think about this ...

no ? how 's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them ?

in the middle of the night ?

i 'm fine .

she 's worried about you . and , quite frankly , so am i .

he 's not . he 's looking for a flaw in us , john .

danny witwer is scheduled for a tour of containment tomorrow --

you understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we 've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime .

has the observer from justice shown up yet ?

tell me not to worry , john .

you do n't have to chase me , fletcher .

you do n't have to do this , chief .

chief , the investigator from the fed is here .

i show time of occurrence , friday at fifteen-zero-six hours .

amazing there 's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that .

we 're in motion on something .

did he close the front door ?

go ahead .

look at the kid . in this one , he 's on the left of the man in the suit .

run the subscription list ...

i have a warrant in my pocket that says different .

to hineman ?

it was iris hineman . she developed the precogs , designed the system and pioneered the interface .

then why ca n't they see rapes , or assaults ... or suicides ?

there 's no way of knowing for sure . she could 've forgotten whatever it is you 're looking for ...

do i know you ? who are you ?

she said ...

to you ? i do n't think so ... what 'd she say ?

wally . this is danny witwer . he 's from justice and we 're to give him a full run of the farm .

tell me how .

so ?

no . no way . i would n't even know where to begin ! those thoughts about my cousin elena -- they were just thoughts . i would never --

i 'm sorry for whatever i 'm gon na do ! and i swear , i did n't do any of the stuff i did !

are you reading my mind right now ?

she 's a precog ?

i need help with her .

who are you ?

i forgive you ...

i feel bad about that . i need you to forgive me .

you 're alive ?

tell me , who was it , set this up ?

what the fuck is going on ?

i do n't know -- i never saw his face . all i know is , the next day i was out , so the guy must 've had juice somewhere . look , man , you got ta go through with this .

who said i would ?

if you do n't kill me , my family gets nothing !

no .

the safest place of all .

what safe place is that ?

you should n't . you should n't trust anyone ... certainly not the attorney general who wants it all for himself . not the young federal agent who wants your job . not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he 's created . do n't trust anyone . just find the minority report .

why should i trust you ?

you want to bring it down .

do you ? really ?

i believe in that system ...

answer my question . did lamar burgess know about the minority report ?

you 're saying that i 've halo 'd innocent people ?

obviously , for precrime to function , there ca n't be any suggestion of fallibility . after all , what good is a justice system that instills doubt ? it may be reasonable , but it 's still doubt .

jesus christ -- why did n't i know about this ?

what ?

how can you avoid a man you 've never met ?

heal who ?

you have three minutes to tell me what you 're doing here before i feed you to a few of my more predacious plants .

anne lively ... but i never said she drowned .

lamar , do you know the reason why john came here to work with you ?

this is all my fault .

i padded your expense account for the last six months .

my god ...

i 'll be right there .

so there is a way to fool the system ?

we teach the tech 's to identify them and disregard ...

how ?

i 'm thinking someone got away with murder .

now the second image . watch the water . the wind 's changed . the ripples are going the other way .

what ?

the mets . john does n't think they 've got a deep enough pitching roster this year , and i 'm inclined to agree .

uh , yeah , being concert master of the philadelphia symphony orchestra is one of our most popular choices ...

treasury ... then this would be your first actual murder scene .

i do n't know , why ?

he 's trying to prove his innocence .

she 's in the room with him when he kills crow . she 's already a part of his future .

it does n't matter . he wins .

no offense , sir , but why would n't he just run ?

anderton 's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media ca n't id him to pick his pocket . there 's fewer consumers down there , which means fewer scanners to target him .

there 's thousands of units like this one .

what ? !

do n't worry . i 'll bring him in unharmed .

somehow , i do n't think that was walt whitman .

i 'm sure you 've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology .

people have gotten the message . gum ?

ca n't they shut that off ?

you know i need to use you .

not very well , i 'm sure . i 'd probably start doping myself . or maybe i 'd ...

but john was with him at the pool ?

since right after we lost our son .

he 's not here now , is he ?

just sugar then . you and john ever come here ?

i like it .

wally , the other two can still function , right ?

do me a favor , arthur , keep him on til i see what 's happening .

look , bobby , i do n't know what happened , and i do n't want to know what happened , but something 's up .

you 're bobby , right ?

hi , uh , excuse me . i 'm here to see mr. reuben .

then put my martel 's in a snifter .

yeah , snifters are for cognac --

yeah 'women . ' if i was a fag i could get laid in a subway .

is it the good room ?

what , sir ?

here . take it . bring me back eighty .

what happened ? i thought we were playing truth or dare .

i do n't get it . what do you do ?

you girls are n't from brooklyn or anything ?

oh no . what is it this time .

but maybe that 's okay . maybe that 's just what you need .

what ? you do n't think horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang ?

nobody 's fuckin talking to you .

i love you . come home .

i do n't know .

he 's not doing it .

what 's wrong , baby ?

ricky 's not wearing one .

i want you to take her with you .

how could you let her see this ?

look at the bills . i ca n't . i 'm not gon na put my daughter through what i went through .

good ! it 'll save me the trouble of repeating myself . he 's not fucking driving you !

ho 's a good guy --

go finish getting ready . i 'll take care of dinner .

you talk to max today ?

i do n't like you working with wendy . why are you working with wendy ?

bobby , this is a plumb gig . it 's a bunch of young agents and it 's at a restaurant . it 's gon na be easy and we 'll make a lot of money .

honey ?

come on , dude . the other chick 's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet . i know the drill , i 'll wear a rubber --

get your hands off of her .

i said no touching .

but what about them ?

i guess inside . or he never made it . either way , i do n't give a shit . let 's get this over with .

where 's ricky .

he was uptown when i paged him . i gave him the address . he 's meeting us there .

and not a word to maxie . he 'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge .

yeah .

how bad is it ?

what 's his name ?

nah , man . he 's just making contact . that 's our man . the welsh guy .

get away from her .

c'mon girl . eat up .

i 'm serious . humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while . might be nice to buy your lady something . all it takes is one fight .

5-5-1 .

draw .

i had a fight up at sportsman 's .

it 's already been a hell of a night . where you been ?

i do n't need a few days . i 'm gon na settle down with jess . she 's through dancing . we 're opening a restaurant .

not you . i want ricky to answer .

what is it ?

yes , for expenses and such . now , you 'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go . you each have been given an extra battery , so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned . am i making myself abundantly clear ?

do me a favor . think about it . is that too much too ask ?

it 's not that i do n't appreciate the offer ...

yeah . sure .

we try something out . there 's someone i 'm in business with named ruiz . i want you to accompany him on a drop . just as scenery . ruiz has his boys . i just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench . as a deterrent .

yeah . sorry .

i know .

it 's my fault . i send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life , then i wonder why you seered . it 's my fault . the tooth is on me . but no more . i 'm 'reassigning ' you .

bobby . you 're a bull terrier and i got you herding sheep .

what ?

they were out of line --

she was fast , huh ?

pshhh ...

what 's the plan ?

good morning .

now that limey motherfucker 's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me . maxie 's gon na shit a nokia when he hears about ... aw , shit , i better call him before he hears .

'dis ? ' 'dis ? ' you 're not in a position to 'dis ' , or 'give props ' , or whatever your real world sense of fucking decorum tells you to do . you 're nothing . you 're wallpaper . you 're not here to make fucking friends . asking a motherfucker where he lives . and who the fuck told you 'red dragon ' ? .

taken care of ?

this ruiz guy , what 's his deal ?

'trustafarians ? '

yeah .

spa ?

no . that 's cool , man .

so , jimmy , you know where this address is ?

soho .

he 's not here .

ruiz is n't here .

i 'll be a minute .

where do you get this shit ?

so what do we do ?

ricky . i 'm trying to save this money . understand ? i 'm trying to make it so my girlfriend does n't have to grind her ass into other men 's erections so her daughter can go to private school .

yes i did . you asshole ! what about the room ?

' dancing around like a smacked ass . oh , and that coat check girl you 've been dragging around as 'insurance ' does n't even speak english .

you ca n't go in there . they know you 're with ruiz .

you would think .

i detected no vibe other than that ruiz thinks you 're a fucking idiot .

what did i 'get ? '

missing what ? he did n't say shit .

well , i thought you understood and i was just missing it .

i do n't know .

this shit 's sketchy . why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we 're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else ?

you got something to say --

motherfucker ...

what the fuck do you have to complain about ?

i never intended to test you two to that extent , but you both came through . i should 've been informed there was a flag on the play , but i 'll take that up with ruiz . i made a few calls back east . those punks were n't tied in with anyone . as for the welshman , he was n't in on it . he was just plain dumb . as for you , ricky , your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van .

goodbye .

so , wait , what are we dropping off ?

keys .

you will not carry any other pagers with you . you will not carry anything , for that matter , that i have not just given you .

what ?

the red dragon .

he has a cute what ... ?

i 'll get it .

yeah . this shit 's fucking brilliant . i just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit , speeding their brains out . i got ta bring a case of it home to my mates . it 's illegal back home , you know .

dip ?

i am .

well , word on the street is you 're welsh .

and here i thought you flew in some out of town muscle . how 's it going , men ?

you could of been something , archie , but the devil got to you .

1 , 2 , 8 ; 2 , 8 , 1. i git 'em all ?

i 'm there , daddy . wheww . i 'm cool enough to kill .

ai n't nuthin ' in the world to give you that real deep cool . like girl . you there ?

what ?

i like your heart and i like your style . you might just do , little . lessen you got to git back to that train job .

yes , sir .

no , my mama . she 's from grenada .

you ai n't bullshitting me , is you , boy ?

man 's rep travels .

when they want your ass , wo n't nothing keep you out .

red , and i ai n't no punk .

he had it coming .

sit down . we ai n't fixing to eat you . you look brand new in town . pretty handy with a bottle .

he gave it to you , archie . he did .

that 's a fact . what you do , boy ?

man live by his rep .

`` i 'm telling you god 's words , not to hustle . ''

brother bembry , can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street ?

i want to . god knows i want to .

tell him that .

i want to , bembry , but i ca n't .

for evil to bend its knee , admit its guilt , implore his forgiveness , is the hardest thing on earth --

but the key to islam is submission . that is why twice daily we turn to mecca , to the holy of holies , to pray . we bend our knees in submission .

i will not touch the white man 's poison : his drugs , his liquor , his carrion , his women .

i sure met some .

i knew you 'd hear me . the white man is the devil . all white men are devils .

then the devil is white .

who are you ?

i 'm not malcolm little and i 'm not satan .

lem me tell you about history : black history . you listening ?

man , i 'm studying in the man 's book . i do n't dig half the words .

then what you telling me to study in them for ?

i ca n't make out that shit .

but everything the white man taught you , you learned . he told you you were a black heathen and you believed him . he told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light . and you believed him . he taught you to worship a blond , blue-eyed god with white skin -- and you believed him . he told you black was a curse , you believed him . did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary ?

i read . i study . because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself . respect his body and his mind . quit taking the white man 's poison into your body : his cigarettes , his dope , his liquor , his white woman , his pork .

do n't con me .

tell you this : you ai n't no fool .

i ai n't never seen a cat like you . ai n't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay ?

what you sniffing around for ? i told you i gave you your last fix .

like what ? looking like me ? like a nigger ? ! why do n't you want to look like what you are ? what makes you ashamed of being black ?

man , you been locked up too long , everybody conks . all the cats .

talk , daddy , i 'm listening . hey that ai n't bad . you got some more ?

if you ai n't trying to punk me , what 's your hype ?

man , what do you want ?

make it plain .

folks are sitting out there today , not next week , expecting to hear our program .

malcolm , they keep calling , threatening us . i 'm going crazy , when is this going to stop ?

i 'm sorry . i have n't been the best husband or father .

dear heart , you have to help me . i 'm raising our kids practically by myself , while you 're running all over the world . you do n't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home ?

will they ? are you sure ? are you sure or are you blind ?

the nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me .

a long time ago . you 've repaid them many times over . ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture .

there 's always talk , always been talk , and always will be talk . do n't they say how i 'm trying to take over the nation , how i 'm getting rich off the nation ?

we 've never had a fight . not a real one . but we 're going to have one right now if you do n't talk about it .

i just want to sit here and be still .

i 'm not made of glass .

because you 're in trouble .

did you hear what i said ?

at a gas station . will you marry me ?

i 'm in detroit .

what have you set your mind to ?

how old are you , betty ?

no , good sisters are rare . we need every one . tell me something : how tall are you ?

oh , yes , there is . i know a lot about you . brother bembry briefed me .

how do you like it ?

you 've been on your feet for days . and did n't even finish your salad .

considering today 's standards of animal raising and curing meats , i do n't fully understand the restriction on pork .

what points ?

shall i tell my sisters that we oppose marriage ?

is my family here yet ?

no , that wo n't be necessary . i 'll be all right .

let 's get out of this cold .

just what are you saying ?

what color were the original hebrews ?

just what is your question ?

why do n't you just ask your question ?

entirely .

allah akbar .

what ?

if she got eyes , she do .

mind your own goddamn business ... she comes in a lot ?

shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till i explained what concurrently meant . it meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the charlestown state prison . the date was february 1946. i was n't quite 21. i had not yet begun to shave .

burglary , count one -- 8 to 10 years ; count two , 8 to 10 years ; count three , 8 to 10 years ...

two years in the women 's reformatory at framingham .

i 'm going to bed . i got ta work tomorrow , need my rest .

i better not come in .

i think sometimes , mrs. little , candor is the only kindness .

i wo n't let myself come between you and your father . go home .

how many you turning out ?

c'mere .

sheeet , you ai n't . i had aplenty .

well , sammy 's dead . yeah , fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him . had twenty-five grand in his pocket .

the honorable elijah muhammad says you should pay it all your mind . if you got a mind .

yeah .

jesus , red , she 's just a kid .

except she live on the hill and got a grandma .

shorty , this is laura .

might be all right .

then i put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby . he gets his jollies off .

only a pig could do a thing like that .

eddie , let 's see that blotter .

i 'm minister malcolm x. two witnesses saw him brought in . he was not brought out .

are you sure ?

i did n't know then that i was a nigger .

we were parceled out , all five of us . i went to this reform school and lived at this woman 's house . she was in charge .

it 's not worth it . be with them instead .

it 's what you and rosanna named me . right ?

hombre en fuego . man on fire . that 's what the papers have named you .

believe it or not , you 're safe here . the judicial police will kill you . if they can . this page ?

i traced the pin . i have an address for you . but i need to see you .

you do n't , i 'll call you . oh ! i have a tape recording that i am sure will interest you .

he 's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation . he 's high on my hit list .

i have connections .

[ aurillio rosas sanchez . ]

[ what is his name ? ]

[ daniel what ? ]

[ what is his name ? ]

[ we page him and he calls back on this cell phone . ]

[ reina rosas . ]

[ what money ? ]

[ we do n't know ! we never see his face ! we have to wait in the other room . he was screaming to the girl that ... ]

[ the boss did or his brother . ]

[ do n't lie to me . ]

[ i see him sometimes at the handball court in chapultepec on a saturday afternoon . ]

i do n't know , but i know his face .

[ he called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch . ]

[ i do n't know . we were just given instructions to take her . ]

[ who are you ? ]

[ drive . ]

[ the girl 's . pinta 's . ]

[ this is not possible . but in that house i have money . if i tell you where -- ]

[ how much do you want ? ]

[ i want you . ]

[ two and a half ! the rest was paper ! strips of paper ! ]

[ there was no ten million dollars . ]

[ that he used policemen . that you killed them , it made it a police matter . the ramos family could n't refuse our involvement . ]

[ lucky how ? ]

[ it 's all up to you , commandante . tell me about you and 'the dreamer ' . ]

[ correct ! ]

how does it affect you ?

cut the stock here . the barrel here . make sure you file it smooth . rocket launchers ?

pinta ...

there 's still ink on my fingers from last week .

samuel ramos . owns one of the plants in juarez . the jap car industry is in the toilet . he 's trying to persuade ford to partner with him . i think he 's in trouble . he asked me if i knew anyone he could trust .

how long you staying , crease ?

you been working ?

so what 's wrong ?

listen it was a calculated risk . i 've done it a million times and never got caught .

creasy ? ? ? where the fuck are you ?

you got that right .

now that 's a question . i do n't know about your mom . for me , the problem is n't in the glass . the problem 's in between my ears .

you do n't drink like you used to .

there 's no such thing as tough . you 're either trained or untrained .

i 'm tough , creasy . i 'm tough as you .

yeah . two or three .

did you used to ?

do you have a girlfriend , creasy ?

yes .

[ yeah . can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand ? ]

you feel sorry for the husband ?

it must be difficult having lots of wives .

in the west , it 's one wife for one husband , but different cultures have different rules .

it was in a book at school . concubine .

did you sleep alright ?

i do n't think they 're broken . anywhere else ?

no .

maybe . did you hear him ?

what are you doing ?

i go to school , do n't i ?

hmmm ?

did you like school , creasy ?

we 're taking a different way home .

places where the road bends , places away from buildings , places where the traffic thins out . but you do n't have to understand . i do . so no talking .

creasy . just call me creasy .

in between you can take mom shopping and to lunch . does that sound alright , mr. creasy ?

an autosequestra . kalfus arranged for pinta to be taken to a safehouse . i 'm sure he thought she 'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching tv . it did n't work out that way . everything got fucked up when i killed the cops and tazinari saw an opportunity .

the traffic takes some getting used to .

please , it 's lisa ... i 'll be coming with you tomorrow . i have lunch with friends .

it insults maria . slip it to the dog if you have to ... do you mind if i talk to you for a moment ?

mr. creasy , i wanted to make sure you have everything you need .

you 've done much of this work before ?

so are you .

you 're american .

last night . do you know something ?

los arcos . was a little girl kidnapped recently ? about twelve maybe ?

she understands men .

i know you need to please lisa . an ass like that is hard to find . good bodyguards are even harder .

[ the car will not be powerful and have no trunk . ]

he 's like a great big bear . 'creasy bear ' ...

samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard . it may take a few days , but you 're going back .

good news . you 're going back to school .

she likes him .

i think it 's nice he 's american .

he has experience in related work . a great deal of it .

these people are professionals . they do n't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt .

i 'm only asking for one thing . and it 's not an extravagance . it 's not even for me ; it 's for our daughter .

[ who 's that ? ]

[ and as long as we 're talking information , there 's something else as well . ]

[ you only give information so you can fuck me . ]

[ when you talked to him , did he look sane ? ]

[ and left three more dead men . ]

[ it 's a moral issue . on one hand you 're cleaning up the bad guys , but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys . ]

[ we did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings , including the little girl . the same man 'the dreamer ' . listen to this . ]

light . at the end of a long , dark tunnel . somehow , she showed him it was alright to live again .

he 'll deliver more justice in a weekend , than ten years of your courts and tribunals . so stay out of his way .

none of your business . or mine for that matter . i got nothing more to say .

what happened to him ? what happened to creasy ?

you and creasy both . a two man army according to interpol . panama . lebanon with the druze . desert storm . where you were contracted by the u.s. army to hunt down elite iraqi military commanders . you two were a married couple .

i can take care of myself .

yes . but if i traced creasy to you , others will do it as well . their facilities are as good as my own , if not better .

that 's what friends do .

i 'm sure he is n't . though he 's certainly adept at killing .

hey , herbie ...

she musta kept you inna shadows all night .

boy , she musta been some talker . she musta been about fifty years old .

i do n't feel like going , angie . i thought i 'd take this girl to a movie .

are you kidding ?

you want me to ride down with you ?

waddaya gon na do now ?

my old lady , every word outta her mouth , when you gon na get married ?

yeah , sure .

well , we 're back to that , huh ? i say to you , `` what do you feel like doing tonight ? '' and you say to me , `` i do n't know , what do you feel like doing ? '' and then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer , watching sid caesar on television . well , i tell you what i feel like doing . i feel like calling up this mary feeney . she likes you .

well , let 's call her up . what can we lose ?

i do n't know , ang ' . wadda you feel like doing ?

come on over about half past seven , we 'll think of something . hello , ma , what 's the matter ?

well , that 's all . you will see . today , tomorrow , inna week , he 's gon na say to you , `` hey , ma , it 's no good being a single man . i 'm tired-a running around . '' then he 's gon na say , `` hey , ma , wadda we need this old house ? why do n't we sell this old house , move into a nicer parta town ? a nice little apartment ? ''

that 's the first time marty ever brought a girl to this house . she seems like a nice girl . i think he has a feeling for this girl . you heard him sing . he been singing like that all morning .

your son marty ?

marty .

oh , catherine , please ! do n't make a tragedy . you come to my house where you know you be happier yourself .

catherine , do n't make an opera outta this . the three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms . you are an old goat , and she has an italian temper . she is a good girl , but you drive her crazy . catherine , you are no fool . you know this is no good , an old woman living with a husband and wife . two women inna same kitchen , anna house burns down .

you know what they say . they say things are no good in this house . catherine , your son is married . leave him in peace . he wantsa be alone with his wife . they do n't want no old lady sitting inna balcony . now i tell you what i think . i want you come live with me in my house with marty and me . in my house , you have your own room . you do n't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here . we will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls . you are dear to me , and you are dear to marty . we are pleased for you to come .

when was this ?

you told me .

did i tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me ?

that 's nice . i got ta letter from my husband 's cousin in abruzzi . his mother died .

i got ta pain in my left side , and my leg throbs like a drum .

waddaya doing new year 's eve ?

i 'll wait for your call .

i 'd like that very much .

please ...

no ...

i like you . i like you . i been telling you all night , i like you ...

you want me to take you home , i 'll take you home .

yes , i know .

i really should get home , i told my father ... well , i suppose a little while longer . i wonder if there 's any place around here i could put some makeup on ...

i only got about three bucks on me now , but i just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of webster avenue . why do n't we walk back to my house ? i 'll run in , pick up some dough , and let 's step out somewhere .

it 's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop , marty .

so then mr. gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop , and everybody pleaded with me to take it . so that 's what happened . i did n't wan na be a butcher .

yes , i know .

i do n't know either . i think i 'm a very nice guy . i also think i 'm a pretty smart guy in my own way .

so there you are . so i guess i 'm not such a dog as i think i am .

oh , i cry all the time , any little thing . my brothers , my brother-in- laws , they 're always telling me what a goodhearted guy i am . well , you do n't get goodhearted by accident . you get kicked around long enough , you get to be a real professor of pain . i know exactly how you feel . and i also want you to know i 'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself . so you see , you 're not such a dog as you think you are .

goodnight .

you must n't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law . she also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for .

i 'll see you around .

oh , that 's a sad story .

oh , that 's nice . so the doctor was wrong , was n't he ?

she was always a bit thin in the hips ...

about eight o'clock .

what time is it ?

that means he 'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old .

boy , that mickey spillane , he sure can write .

no , i do n't know . that 's why i 'm asking you .

no , listen , that 's my mother , i 'm gon na pay for her ...

sure , what ?

i do n't know , ma . i 'm all knocked out . i think i 'll just hang arounna house and watch ...

so what are you gon na do tonight , marty ?

well , let 's not get inna fight about it , ma .

that was a nice girl last night , marty . she was n't a very good-looking girl , but she looks like a nice girl . i said , she was n't a very good-looking girl ... not very pretty ...

hello , ma , waddaya say , it 's getting a little late .

all right , ma . i 'll be back in about an hour , an hour anna half .

i offered her , ma , she do n't want nothing .

oh , it 's a sad business . my sister , catherine , she do n't get along with her daughter-in-law , so she 's gon na come live with us .

we just got here about fifteen minutes ago . ma , i want you to meet miss clara snyder . she 's graduate of new york university . she teaches chemistry in benjamin franklin high school .

i 'm ugly ... i 'm ugly ! i 'm ugly !

so i 'll die without a son .

ma , i 'm gon na stay home and watch jackie gleason .

you got ta good heart .

sure , ma , it 's okay with me .

oh man , you shoulda come with us last night , marty . that one for you was a real lunatic . how 'd you make out ?

hello , ralph . how 'd you make out with those nurses last night , ralph ?

you still owe me ten bucks from last week , if that 's what you 're working up to .

... i been talking about two nurses leo and me picked up in a bar on seventy-first street .

hiya , ralph ...

you want a beer , ang ' ?

you should be ashamed of yourself .

that 's swell , missus fusari .

hello , thomas , how do you feel ?

ma , you want something to eat , some tuna fish ?

do n't worry . i 'm gon na take care-a the whole thing .

siddown , thomas , siddown .

all right , ginnie , do n't get so excited .

sure , sure .

on accounta ...

that 's all right , that 's all right ...

because i called up tommy 's brother joe , and i said , `` joe , she 's driving me crazy . why do n't you take her for a couple of years ? '' and he said , `` oh no ! '' i know i sound like a terrible woman ...

aunt theresa , you got this big house here . i mean , you got this big house just for you and marty . and i thought maybe tommy 's mother could come here and live with you and marty .

marty , i do n't know how to tell you how much i appreciate what you and your mother are doing , because the kinda thing was happening in our house was virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby . so my mother comes in ...

how 's marty been lately , aunt theresa ?

what do i do with it hawk ? this is a little out of my line .

he 'll live if that 's what you mean . but somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there 's nothing left between his legs .

i believe it takes both . i 'd have to look it up .

how they goin ' , losing preacher ? what do you hear from the pope ?

well , sure , but i 'm also worried about walt waldowski painless . his poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling , and he said what difference did it make , it was just a card game .

sure , you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake .

what are you going to do with him ?

just one for a start .

reckon so , but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite .

not enough to be a pro .

look at that right eye .

pour one for painless .

how you , walt ? we was just fixing to have a nightcap .

do n't you use olives ?

is there any reason why we should n't know the name of it ?

back home .

where ?

now i got you for a witness , i 'm going to try again . so far all i dragged out of him is he 's from bahston and he 's only been in the army two months . where were you when they drafted you ?

i have great interest for america , his peoples and his custom .

hey , you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging bible !

i do n't believe it 's right for you to involve a boy who 's not seventeen years old yet ...

perfectionist .

like the spearchucker said , that 's possible . anyway , it 's been an interesting association .

let 's hear from you , you goddam yankee . be nice to see you some time .

hell , man , that do n't matter . we 're loaded . we were big wheels in the black market in seoul .

we could steal one of the choppers .

any time . whenever we want .

yeah , if i can .

look at the size of those two beasts .

how come nobody knows about him ? and you do ?

sure you have , only as 'spearchucker ' jones .

how can you say a thing like that about an officer in the united states army ?

i guess that 's why you go for hot lips houlihan .

good thinking , duke . how about it , ho-jon ? can you round up a few of the boys ?

hail to the chief ! we-all got a responsibility , men . he 's crowned like a king ought to be , but he ca n't just walk to the mess hall by himself . he has to be carried by native bearers .

this time he did it to a kid who 's simple enough to believe him . why do n't you dump the mother , henry ? he creates more work than he gets done .

must be painlees pole day in the shower tent .

we did n't have a chance , little androscoggin college against the big green , but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds . then this great passer of theirs let one go , snow and all ...

yeah , that 's right . you better get us a chest-cutter before there 's trouble .

we sure do n't aim to cause any trouble ... yeah , she seems to grow on you .

so we got to cut him fast . i figure from the x-ray it ai n't just the spleen . we also got to snatch his right kidney .

this kid 's ready but we wo n't know all the damage till we get in and see what 's happened . what have you got ?

what do you think of that piece of scenery , yankee boy ?

what 's the initials 'mp ' stand for , hawkeye ?

c.o . is colonel blake . lieutenant colonel henry braymore blake . one of them regular army clowns . push you around so it 's hard to get any decent work done .

ayuh , only it 's early , i need a drink to wake me up .

ravenous . what about you ?

i do n't mind . if we give them something to talk about .

i have a tent to myself .

i 'm sure we could find a date for your team . why do n't i take it up with henry ? thanks for the drink , boys .

so if it ai n't staring us in the face , it 's got to be retroperitoneal . and that , along with the look of the wounds , makes me figure he 's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we wo n't find unless we look for it .

there 's nothing to talk about , general . you take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock . either way you 're liable to learn something .

hawkeye 's asking the major 's opinion on a point of anatomy .

we need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out .

might make kind of a social issue , not having any other negro officer .

he only lasted one season .

we 'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side .

it 's in pretty deep .

best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time .

when you make up your mind , get in touch . the golf club is probably the best place to leave a message .

your high school friend who went around saying 'me lay , you lay ? ' to all the young females in the community . as i remember , you said it was quite a successful approach .

did i ever tell you about me lay marston ?

do n't worry , son . that 's captain mcintyre , and he 's the best chest surgeon in the far east and maybe in the whole u.s. army . he 'll fix you up fine . your daddy saw to that .

beautiful . what do you think ? should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later ? if he 's still alive .

but were n't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the congressman 's son ?

no , no , that one .

it 's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and does n't have to take any time outs .

we 're throwing him a last supper . we came to invite you .

part of him . painless is the owner and operator of the pride of hamtrack . that 's where he comes from ... hamtrack , michigan .

what are they peeking at ? captain waldowski in the shower ?

if you do n't know what you 've seen , why should i ?

sister , if i knew the answer to that i sure as hell would n't be here .

i wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the army medical corps .

all of them ?

honey , nobody as pretty as you could ever impose ... please sit down . coffee ?

hang in there .

it 's possible

what 's the matter ?

i think we could still have a chance .

the bastards outconned us .

i 'm thinking about how we can make more money . suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points . then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the general and his friends to give us some real odds .

in fact i 'd rather not try to influence you at all . let 's just go in and take a look , and then you think it through for yourself .

you think he wo n't .

i did n't mean with me .

do you think anything between us could be impersonal ? or pure ? you better forget logic , because you 're proving why i should n't go to bed with you .

it could be a purely impersonal thing . what matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions .

a man would be more considerate . he would n't come home to his wife a nervous wreck .

you 're on his side all of the sudden ?

dear , sweet hawkeye .

even if i were n't .

i do n't make the distinction . but the sex urge is a powerful force . in women just as much as men .

and absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband . do we have that in common , captain ?

you 're an attractive man .

they do n't have to be dull . i mean if you and me put our minds together ...

at first is no doubt . but then i am seeing on his paper he work in american hospital . and i think there are so many drugs in such a places , he could take some by mistake .

yes , i know . hi , ho-jon . how did it go ?

thanks , reverend . thank you both for tipping me off . you do n't know a captain forrest or a captain pierce , do you ?

be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held !

they 're supposed to hold short-arm inspection .

what do you want with those two medical officers ?

what do you do in the joint besides pimp ?

i wonder , if red 's fix swings it for me , what 's heaven really like ?

you do n't have any problem . you 've got thirty good years ahead of you , easy . maybe you 'll have to cut down as you grow older , get along with just two fiancees , but ...

but it 's all over now , and i ca n't face it . imagine if you found out you were one , you would n't like breaking the news to your wife . well , i got the same problem multiplied .

that 's what you 've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on ? repressing your real self ?

no , never in the slightest .

you 've been drawn to other males ? since you were a kid ?

painless , you must n't talk that way . it 's a lot of crap . cover for what ?

there 's this native broad works in the laundry . i do n't know if you 've noticed .

poker sounds great . when do you play ?

finest kind . captain forrests say you better haul ass home quick . we got new chest-cutter in our tent .

stop acting like a colonel , henry . you know trapper would n't sock him without a good reason .

major burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours . tell them captain pierce and captain forrest are on their way .

your tent ?

you do n't aim to cause any trouble but ?

they 've all tried . nobody 's got to first base .

okay , lieutenant dish . i guess she 's already ... involved with somebody here .

the blonde dish .

i 'm colonel blake . you fellows just passing through ?

we got it , men ... ho-jon 's keep as androscoggin ... if there is such a place . and the big news is , the general wants a rematch .

i can try , sir .

can you make out what they 're talking about ?

to major burns ' tent . yes , sir .

sir ?

yes , dammit , and ...

one of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight ?

those two big guys were tackles on the cleveland browns , and the redhead played halfback with the rams .

in that case , here are ten basic plays . i think that 's about all this bunch can handle .

it 's an american boy 's rupture you 're supposed to close .

yeah ?

good morning .

we do n't have to see him . call that halfassed army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid 's esophagus and take x- rays .

mine 's already been struck , and it does n't have to be very fancy .

colonel merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the regular army , a soldier first and a doctor second . a member of several patriotic organizations , he believes it 's america 's god-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the asian mainland .

as long as there 's a pile-up , we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest .

nice .

you were ? i thought you were chasing me ?

yeah , that 's the one .

no , not that bad . it was a fella that sends you flowers every day . er , what 's his name ? mr. norton 's nephew .

can i help you pack ?

uh-huh . to carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech .

say , he 's a friend of mine .

you know something ? i 've actually fallen in love with him .

yes !

against anything . just protest .

against what ?

oh , that 's 'cause we both play doohickies . i met him in a box car a couple o ' years ago . i was foolin ' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in . i have n't been able to shake him since .

yeah , maybe .

er , would you , er , would you like to make some money ?

john ! i 'm so glad to see you . ii was terribly worried .

mr. d. b. norton !

devoted entirely to the interests of all the john does all over the country . which practically means , ninety per cent of the voters . he will also announce the third party 's candidate for the presidency . a man whom he , personally , recommends . a great humanitarian ; the best friend the john does have .

a third party ?

all right , but present it to him as a great cause for the common man .

how do you do .

money .

. . . er , this john doe idea is yours , huh ?

father 's . . . i never knew he had a diary .

that 's your father 's diary , ann .

if you 're thinking of that thousand dollars , forget it . it 's practically gone . we owed everybody in town . now , you 've just got ta stop giving all your money away .

you 're marvelous , ma . you 're just like father used to be . do you realize a couple of weeks ago we did n't have enough to eat ourselves ?

your purse . i need ten dollars .

yeah , i know . what are you looking for ?

oh , yes you will , ann dear . . . you 're very clever .

now listen , annhe ca n't possibly get in without our seeing him . i 'm watching the side door and the colonel 's out front , so stop worrying .

what 's the idea ?

duets ? but can we trust him ?

oh .

when you 're desperate for money , you do a lot of things , mr. connell . he 's our man , i tell you .

he 's perfect ! a baseball player . what could be more american !

looks all right

well , you 're catching on .

sure ! when you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you do n't drop it like a hot potato . why , this is good for at least a couple of months . you know what i 'd do ? between now and let 's say , christmas , when he 's gon na jump , i 'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood , his schooling , his first job ! a wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world . the problem of the average man , of all the john does in the world .

a deal ?

there is no letter . i made it up .

we 'll get a handwriting expert to what !

it is n't the money . we 're after circulation . what we need is fireworks . people who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments .

he 's watching the other door .

colonel !

say , all this john doe business is batty , if yuh ask me .

how many is that , six ? pretty hungry , were n't you ?

they all say they wrote the john doe letter .

what do they want ?

hey , boss . get a load of this .

shut up !

hey , do you know something ? she supports a mother and two kids . what do you know about that ?

where is she ?

there you are , boss , just like you ordered . symbols of the little people .

hey , doc , look . look , doc . gim me that again , will yuh ? who 's gon na get him ?

the heelots !

you do n't have towhy , we 're with you , mr. doe . we just lost our heads and acted like a mob . why , we . . .

yeah . that'sthat 's him . of course , you do n't know grubbel , but he 's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody 'd have anything to do with him . er , that is until murphy , the postman told us the truth . `` why , grubbel , '' he says , `` he lives out of garbage cans because he wo n't take charity . because it 'd ruin his self-respect , '' he says .

oh , yeah . we made sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves the john doe club . and , say , incidentally , this is my wife . come here , honey .

yeah ? well , you can have it !

tear down all the fences . why , if you tore one picket off of your neighbor 's fence he 'd sue you !

what was i doin ' up there makin ' a speech , anyway ? me ? huh ? gee , the more i think about it the more i could . . .

you bet i will ! as fast as i can ! gon na get some canned goodsa fishing rod , and the rest i 'm gon na give away .

i thought i could do it . i was so damn sure of myself . but i did n't know what to say . the words would n't come . my mouth turned to mush . you make it look so easy , roper . but it is not . it 's not easy . it 's a different job than looking through the rifle scope .

it might have happened no matter who was up there .

what the fuck is going on .

he 's got the girl .

he 's cutting down the visibility .

there 's your answer . he 's smart .

police corruption . it 's everywhere .

about six years . my partner took me .

same here . i 've watched you in action . very impressive .

well , there 's a good amount of agreement on that .

which apartment ?

husband came home . found that guy and his wife `` in flagrante '' . now he 's holding her at knife point .

my name 's scott roper .

not for you , ray . for me . a close friend of mine was killed this week . the way i figure it , i stop you from doin ' what you said , i 'm one up on body count .

let me show you something , ray .

you do n't want to see what i 'm going to do to her .

first you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss ... no way .

whoa ! wait a minute , ronnie . hold on . i know it 's beautiful here . the sun , the sand , the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you . but we 've got to keep our perspective here . this place is n't real . this is n't reality .

scottie ...

i think i 'll stand out here in the sun .

use your imagination .

korda escaped .

it 's very nice .

what are you talking about ? this is it . this is the stuff right here . well , maybe just a pinch more sugar .

i wanted to get this out of the way .

i 've proved that , did n't i ?

you heard .

a little late for that , scottie . he 's asleep . jack daniels ?

please . i 'm begging you .

greg .

you worship yourself .

really ? ! he 's a wonderful guy . he makes two million a year , and he worships me .

stay up there , girl ...

yeah , they are but ...

what have you promised them ?

who 's running it !

i ca n't do that .

the chief says to tell you how sorry he is . he knew sam baffert was a good man .

and a car .

is there going to be an expression of your appreciation ?

it 's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you .

system 's running on auxiliary . only seven hours before it crashes .

there are two million people in there with you .

because i took it out of your memory .

no , she said she had a son . in a dream she once called life .

from the dream .

nothing , go back to sleep .

just like you always wanted .

guests ?

you do n't have much sex up there in the real world , do you ?

you were right .

i 'm serious , how did you know my name ?

as long as it 's not 'what 's your sign ? '

yes .

no .

you sure he 's going to come ?

yes , so which one of us does that make the coward ?

-- he says the maze has been changed . i need to know for sure .

how long ?

how long 'till we can eject ?

take care ? where the hell are you going --

the woman you 're stuck on .

i 'm south dakota .

where you plugged-in from ?

need the disk back !

not his style .

-- who did he digitize ? !

be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person , then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need .

that 's right .

it 's not used for anything .

a hotel ?

the terrace . first building christoph ever programmed for us .

what ?

because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines ? i mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying , or people who are just god-damned sick of this world --

-- he wo n't .

someone sends the kid a copy of the access program , then runs the maze at the same time the kid does , using the same codes .

does n't make sense . how the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys ?

there was no other choice .

i was n't with you .

what ?

you were n't real .

you said we were on the same programming team .

that 's why they told you you ca n't go inside . they ca n't have you running into her .

corporation can .

-- the inside ?

no .

no .

some things never change , do they ?

do n't know what you 're talking about .

why not ?

this . no point to it .

of course you do . and the only shot you 've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program .

connect to public access .

resurrection .

program name ?

standard , modern , upscale --

male .

tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine .

transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink .

i yield .

i am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the resolution -- without further delay . the senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or --

mr. president !

mr. president , have i permission to bring into this chamber evidence of the response from my state ?

mr. president --

mr. president --

every *aspect* of this matter -- the gentleman 's attack on that section -- everything -- was dealt with in the committee hearing --

mr. president -- gentlemen -- i -- i have risen to a painful duty -- to say that , out of evidence that has come to my attention , i consider senator smith unworthy to address this body !

but -- there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water . besides -- i talked to kenneth allen , who owns some of that land -- and he did n't say anything about a dam . no -- i 'm sure , sir -- there 's something wrong -- and i -- i wo n't vote on this thing until i get a lot of questions answered --

ma 's told me about it a thousand times .

how 's amos , ma ?

hello , ma . clarissa , ma . she 'll be stayin ' a while --

gosh ! you see sir -- i was fixing some plaster for a cast on amos ' leg -- he 's always chewing 'em off . i 'll only be a minute -- if you 'll excuse me , sir --

yes , ma ?

oh , now --

yes ! i 've told senator paine for twenty years --

mine ? why -- naturally -- whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me -- owning a lot of its industry -- newspapers and other odds and ends . and if i thought you had the welfare of the state at heart , like myself -- for instance , if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way -- why , i 'd say you were a man to watch . for a fellow your age , you 'd be in a spot to make a great start in life . if you liked business -- you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top . or politics . if you like being a senator . no reason why you could n't come back to that senate for the rest of your life .

not *me* ! joseph paine is the man they ought to be listening to ! come on !

yay !

saunders -- if there was *any* way --

oh -- saunders --

well , i guess it 's a chance .

i -- i do n't know . i -- i 'm afraid they 've got me licked .

i 'm not .

hello .

i know . do n't tell me . it was a wonderful party . your suit went over big . and she looked beautiful , and she gave her hand when you left her -- and said -- '' thank you , mr . smith . '' oh , but it was the way she *said* it . you like to fell through the floor -- horseradish !

thanks a lot .

the letters ? gosh -- no . i could n't talk letters . i 've got ta scratch 'em out . and say -- i 'm going to tell ma all about you . if i tell it right -- the first thing you know you 're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted .

second drawer .

do you mean all -- look -- look we 'd better open them up -- see what they say here -- look at the money -- what does it say -- '' dear senator smith , i would like to come to your boy 's camp and i shine shoes at the station and here 's nine cents . '' oh , is n't that wonderful . look and he signs it . `` yours truly , stinky moore . '' is n't that marvelous ? say -- have i got some paper here ?

gee -- i hope so . what 's all this ?

must have been tickled pink .

i -- i do n't know how i got it out . my heart was right up here all the time -- i wonder what senator paine thought of it ?

one of the plagues on members of congress -- office-seekers , cranks , people with pet bills . get my son into west point -- or *outta* west point . i 've got a scheme to put people to work . how do i get rid of cockroaches ? some woman 's composed a hymn to replace the star spangled banner . want to hear it ?

in terry canyon ?

yes . the most beautiful i think i ever -- gee -- say -- we 're *never* going to finish this thing ! now , here we go , saunders . i 'm going to talk faster ' n you can write --

and a beautiful woman , too -- do n't you think ?

susan ! susan paine -- that 's beautiful --

i 've got more . you better tell me .

well , if it 's all the same to you --

all right . sure . just curious . the picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle -- or something --

no ! gosh ! i better get moving here , miss saunders -- everybody else calls you just plain `` saunders . '' why ca n't i ?

have you always had to -- work ?

now , this camp is going to be out in your state , of course --

on paper ?

-- that 's the main idea , miss saunders . the united states government is n't going to buy or build this camp -- just lend us the money . you 've made a note of that , huh ?

yes -- sure . why not ? you do n't mind if i take the time to get a pencil ?

i said -- shall we get started *now* or --

yes . shall we start on it right now -- or order dinner first ?

pardon me -- *this* is . where are we now ?

and with your help --

right .

i know -- but you -- you 're going to help .

pardon me . senator paine decided this *with* you ?

why , the bill -- the bill -- to make a national boys ' camp ...

we 're going right ahead with -- *what* ?

go ahead -- punch .

go out to mount vernon . it 'd be a sort of fine thing to do -- see washington 's home just before walking into the senate for the first time -- do n't you think ?

convene -- that 's it -- yes . i got to pick up some of those parliamentary words . i imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the senate without 'em --

you -- uh -- you better relax , senator . you 'll be plumb wore out .

did you say -- bus ?

no !

if you thought as much of being honest -- as you do of being smart -- !

that 's what i said -- the *truth* !

hold on , fellows -- i 'm not used to more then one question at a time --

no ! no ! gosh . see , there you are ! i 'm not making sense !

i -- i 'm awfully glad to be -- that is , it was nice of you to -- uh -- how 's your father ?

just for the fun of it. -- you see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time , i am going to enter in the nationals .

order , gentlemen !

yes , sir --

i -- i 'm sorry , sir . i -- i have a bill --

the chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior senator , mr. smith .

`` i do solemnly swear -- that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states -- against all enemies , foreign and domestic -- that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same -- that i take this obligation freely -- without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion -- and that i will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which i am about to enter . so help me god . ''

yes , *sir* . let 's *go* henry .

how 's that , buddy ?

why , he 's a senator , is n't he ? i 'm surprised at you , mister mcgann --

i would n't wait if i were you .

-- now he wants to talk to the congressmen from the willet creek districts -- he 's run their names down --

my daughter is n't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody* .

listen -- tomorrow i take him to see monuments -- if i have to hit him over the head with a couple !

-- amazing coincidence ! of all places in the world -- to choose willet creek for his boys ' camp !

did i hear right ? did he say *willet creek* ?

yes -- a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading . so calm down , chick -- and -- goodnight .

jeff -- meet mr. cook and mr. griffith -- members of our state headquarters here .

okay . see you here .

well , that 's out . either it 's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or -- . now will you go and call 'em before i change my mind about the whole thing !

saunders -- it 's meat and drink -- lem me at 'im ! five minutes -- ! i 'll make it right with you !

go away , nosey .

all right -- *yes* ! and what does that make me to him ? *nothing* ! i 've got to go about my own business -- and forget it !

what are you talking about ? what difference -- ?

you see -- governor hopper made an appointment in this case that -- well , jeff is n't exactly fitted to the work , let 's say . he 's here to see monuments -- and pass the time . that 's important to -- to my work -- and everybody concerned . so , someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble --

well -- that 's very fine . saunders , some person in your office says you 've quit --

yes . he went to mount vernon to give himself a patriotic address .

by the way , mr. mcgann just phoned -- in a high fever . smith 's gone again . have you any idea where ?

no -- i 'm sorry . i merely saw him home . i 'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle . that 's mcgann 's job .

hey -- joe ! where you going ? we 've got to celebrate tonight !

you ca n't say *that* to --

just a minute , joe !

congressmen , radner , schultz , diggs --

jeff -- this is mr. taylor .

i 'm glad to see you come to your senses . you had me scared there for a minute , thought . let him in .

i do n't want any part of crucifying this boy .

wait a minute -- jim -- you did n't ask *smith* over here !

a young patriot ? -- who recites jefferson and lincoln ? -- turned loose in our nation 's capital ? i think i can .

joe -- do you mean to say -- do you think you can actually *handle* this -- this whatever-you-call-it in washington ?

joe , that 's coming a long way in twenty years since i met you practising law down there in main street .

that 's why i say miller -- horace miller . he jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench . he 'll take orders .

what ! not ol ' honest abe !

well , at the expense of some of the furniture , susan -- you 've made another conquest .

his first 'whiff ' !

mr. president , will the senator yield for a question ?

order !

order ! will senator smith yield to -- ?

will the senator yield ?

i present the credentials of honorable jefferson smith who has just been appointed senator by the governor of my state .

no . do n't ever want to go out without telling us .

he sure is .

yes , you own it .

he walks in the rain , without his hat , and talks to himself .

sometimes twice .

most every day .

yes , sir .

are you married ?

you do n't go out with girls very much , do you ?

no .

you are , are n't you ?

what 's that got to do with it ?

no ! !

yes !

are these the articles ?

did you subsequently write a series of articles about him ?

no ! i resigned last week !

you are under oath , miss bennett . i ask you again - are you employed by the morning mail ?

your honor !

hello , mary ?

oh , an imaginary one . i used to hike a lot through the woods and i 'd always take this girl with me so i could talk to her . i 'd show her my pet trees and things . sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it .

a girl ?

all my life , i 've wanted somebody to talk to . back in mandrake falls , i always used to talk to a girl .

do you mind if i talk to you , mary ? you do n't have to pay any attention to me .

in a day or so , i think .

ready ?

oh , i would n't let them stop me from seeing you . so i threw them out !

could n't sleep . kinda wanted to talk to you . do you mind ?

`` humoresque '' ? i 'll bet you do n't even know how it goes .

oh , i suppose you could do better .

he sounds like a person worth while knowing .

i have n't met anybody here that i like , particularly . they all seem to have the st. vitus dance . [ 12 ] except you , of course . people here are funny . they work so hard at living - they forget how to live last night , after i left you , i was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and i got to thinking about what thoreau said . they created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them .

what 's that ?

there 's times square .

now , what do you see ?

that depends on what they see .

there you are . grant 's tomb . i hope you 're not disappointed .

yes .

uh-huh .

gosh , you look pretty tonight .

you were a lady in distress , were n't you ?

oh , that was so lovely . thank you .

well , i guess i walked too much . i 've been looking for a job all day . i found one , too . i start tomorrow . you 've been awfully kind . thank you very much .

we 're not going out tonight .

no - of course you do n't . we 've forgotten . we 're too busy being smart-alecks . too busy in a crazy competition for nothing .

people have been crucified before .

i 'm crucifying him .

uh-huh .

i ca n't write it , mabel ! i do n't know what 's the matter with me .

my unfailing instinct tells me something 's gone wrong with the stew .

this is for you , mac . the names of all the headwaiters in town . you can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices .

i 'll put you on another job . you need never see him again , eh ?

tell him you 're babe bennett ? tell him you 've been making a stooge out of him ?

sorry , babe . sorry . it would have made a swell story . i just got carried away . that 's too bad . so he proposed to you , huh ? what a twist ! you set out to nail him - and he

yes .

you 'll get it , babe . you 'll get it .

with pay ! she is out the door .

sure .

had the boys follow us .

cinderella man ! babe , you stuck a tag on that hick that 'll stick to him the rest of his life . can you imagine cobb 's face when he reads this ?

have lunch .

look , i can do it !

ow ! my foot 's asleep !

boy , was he burning .

i wonder if they 'd want to make it a quartet .

hurry up !

i tell you that dame 's nuts .

yes , but you said

yes , i know . a week 's gone by and we have n't got the power of attorney yet !

will you stop worrying ! it was i who got old man semple to turn everything over to us , was n't it ? and who got the power of attorney from him ! all right , and i 'll get it again ! i 'll take it easy . those books 'll never leave this office .

well , it has n't happened yet - has it ?

i know , budington . we ca n't afford to have the books investigated right now . you must have said that a thousand times already .

close that door . will you get mrs. cedar on the phone , please ?

john

how is this , sir ?

me sir ?

is that the best you 've got ?

yes , quite all right . thank you , sir .

let me go !

you ca n't come up here !

they say if it had n't been for deeds , they 'd have gotten all the money .

suppose you just answer , miss jane . now , will you tell the court what everybody at home thinks of longfellow deeds ?

yes ! yes ! let 's get on with it .

this is outrageous !

i looked everywhere . i even went to his house . it 's locked up .

i ca n't find him .

mr. cedar is , and i have n't seen him in two days . listen , cedar , we 've got to do something about the newspapers .

hang up .

newspaperman ?

find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away .

charlie , we 're off ! papers all set ?

mandrake falls . m-a-n

yes , of course , if you wish . but you must be prepared . this sort of thing will be daily routine . if it becomes annoying , you let me know . goodbye , mr. deeds . goodbye , sir .

well , if he has a claim , we 'd better see him . send him in .

i mean , about the power of attorney .

huh ?

oh - nothing . no extra charge .

yes . that is to say

when ?

you 're going to new york with us .

saving a lady in distress , eh ? well , i suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young . incidentally , we 'd better get started . you 'll have to pack .

perhaps you did n't hear what i said , mr. deeds ! the whole semple fortune goes to you ! $ 20,000,000 !

yes .

how do you do .

how do you do .

he and jim mason own the tallow works . but that 's not where he makes his money . he makes most of it from his poetry .

no , i 'm his housekeeper .

that 's very kind of you . are you related to him ?

sit down . sure i could n't get you a glass of lemonade or something ?

what ? there must be 2000 of them out there .

listen . listen , longfellow . you 've got brains , kid . you 'll get along swell if you 'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut . do n't talk to anybody ! these newshounds are out gunning for you .

oh , they insisted on following me .

what do i care about arthur ! did you see this stuff in the paper ? how 'd it get in there ? what 'd you do last night ? who were you talking to ?

he 's the shipping clerk at the tallow works . wants a $ 2 raise - or he 'll quit .

gee , i 'm busy . did the opera people always come here for their meetings ?

thanks oh , did you send that telegram to jim mason ?

i 've got one for cobb

well , maybe it is n't to you , but it certainly is a business to me , if i have to make up a loss of $ 180,000 . if it 's losing that much money , there must be something wrong . maybe you charge too much . maybe you 're selling bad merchandise . maybe lots of things . i do n't know . you see , i expect to do a lot of good with that money . and i ca n't afford to put it into anything that i do n't look into . that 's my decision for the time being , gentlemen . goodbye , and thank you for making me chairman .

because it just is n't a business , that 's all !

excuse me , gentlemen , there 's nothing natural about that .

well , then , we must give the wrong kind of shows .

that 's impossible . the opera has never paid .

that 's what i thought . if you do n't mind , i 'm rather interested in the treasurer 's report . i 'd like to hear it .

wait a minute . what does the chairman do ?

it takes so long to detect them because their mood changes so often and so quickly . now , your honor , may i show you ? may i use the chart ?

it reminds me very much of this one . nicht wahr ?

my wife wanted me to tell you she she prays for you every night .

that 's fine . thanks . i 'll look 'em over later .

mrs. semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate .

of course , we do n't want to appear greedy , mr. deeds .

yes , sir .

a child ? my uncle 's ?

yes . your uncle 's common-law wife . she has a legal claim on the estate .

mrs. semple ?

look , he 's temperamental .

yes . have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating ?

well , i do n't know . i

thank you , your honor .

proceed .

personally , i do n't know what mr. cedar 's raving about . from what i can see , no matter what system of government we have , there will always be leaders and always be followers .

not at all .

now about the falkner sisters . that 's kind of funny . i mean about mr. cedar going all the way to mandrake falls to bring them here . do you mind if i talk to them ?

i 'd like to get in my two cents ' worth .

over at that big round table . the one that looks like a poodle .

brookfield just came in .

i 'm a writer myself , you know .

be sure and point 'em out to me , wo n't you ?

fun ? say , listen , i 'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever . boy ! boy ! my headpiece !

thanks , but miss dawson and i are going out to see the sights .

oh , what a magnificent deflation of smugness . pal , you 've added ten years to my life ! a poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious ! delicious ! you 're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity !

the difference between them and me is i know when i 've been a skunk . you take me to the nearest news- stand and i 'll eat a pack of your postcards raw . raw !

say fellow , you neglected me - and i feel very put out . look , sock it right there , will you ? lay one right on the button , [ 6 ] but sock it hard .

you gentlemen going to stay for lunch ?

new mouthpiece . been waiting two weeks for this . kids keep swiping them all the time . they use 'em for bean shooters . what can i do for you gentlemen ?

oh . oh !

south dakota - but on the top .

south dakota - north ?

farmer ?

it would be a nice night to go for a walk , do n't you think ?

yes , lovely . we 've had a lot of nice weather lately .

huh ? oh , yes - yes , of course . her sister . yes , i 've been her sister for a long time .

pack my things , walter . i 'm going home .

very good , sir . oh , i beg pardon . a telegram came for you , sir . i 'll get you some black coffee , sir .

looking for ?

the ones who brought you home , sir . they said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets , shouting : `` back to nature ! clothes are a blight on civilization ! back to nature ! ''

that 's what the two policemen said , sir .

prairie ? oysters ?

what 's that ?

yes , sir .

you 're walter , are n't you ?

well , sir , he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time .

why , i 'm assisting you , sir .

i know my time 's up , but i 've got to get this out while i 've got hold of it --

one hundred books ?

really ? you think so ?

mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm .

i 'm not sure . but i think they 're worried about you .

why are they ganging up against me ?

a friend ?

i 'm not sure she 'll come . she 's in a mood . do you ever go to somebody 's house ?

oh ... a lot of things . several different factors . will you see her , doctor mumford ?

no ... a little . there 's a lot of debate about it .

syndrome ... chronic fatigue syndrome .

we 're not sure . she 's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they 've said different things . some of 'em are callin ' it -- -- epstein-barr virus , and the rest are callin ' it ... chronic fatigue symptom ...

phyllis , i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to shout ...

so ... the university of kentucky . who runs the program down there ?

what ernest means , i think , is we 're very interested in other methodology ... different kinds of training . we 're great believers in learning from each other . i 've learned so much from ern -- dr. delbanco ...

what 's that ?

my approach ?

we 're interested in any new therapies . how would you characterize your approach ?

interesting approach . what was his name ?

let me just say something here ... i have no idea if this is going to help .

should i open it now ?

it 's a thought i had .

where 's your wife , henry ?

not for this . not me , you 're not .

what ?

good , then go .

well , i do n't know ... i only been seeing you --

why not ?

what brought this on ?

it 's all right , it wo n't bite you . under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed . this is the notice .

you 're the doctor , what do you think ?

what do you think 's wrong with her ?

tastes good .

you 've done well .

i 've had my moments .

no , sir . i was empathizing . sorry .

i 'm sorry , your honor .

i do .

yeah .

you do ?

what are they ?

i 've seen you going by on your board , but i did n't realize -- you 're so young ... to be so ...

thanks , lily , i do n't need anything .

lily .

doc ...

lily , i want you to meet skip . skip , lily .

you 're on your own today , honey .

why do you watch ?

you like me . how come ?

four months , two and a half weeks -- that 's how long . and you 've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined .

man , you see him a lot . and it 's very wrong to reveal it . next you 'll be saying what his problem is .

do n't you at least have a back door i can use ?

i 'm a criminal lawyer -- you think i like my clients ? i ca n't stand most of them ! but i do n't kick them out ...

what 's wrong with her ?

got to .

i 'm trying .

can you help mom ?

i been drivin ' since i was twelve .

mother ... go away !

what 's happening here ?

mumford ... like the town ?

well , i got ta say , mrs. cook , you 're right about that .

just who is here , can you tell me ?

wow . you 're something .

i think you do .

what do you mean ?

we 're only talking about six weeks .

you got off easy .

anything ... just ask .

i want to spend the rest of my life with you ... but i 'm not sure you feel the same way .

i do n't know . depends . i 'm in a bad mood .

i know it ! please believe me , i know that ...

but nothing ... i 'm mad as hell . this is a terrible thing you 've done .

i am irate !

you 're not the only one ...

sofie ...

which show was that ?

hello ?

transference !

why do n't you tell me what 's on your mind ?

yes , something 's very wrong , dr. mumford .

thanks to this therapy , i now know what i 'm looking for . i need to find a man like you . not one who 's treating me , of course . and i 'm going to do it , dammit ! you 've given me the confidence .

you 're shockingly honest , that 's what makes you great . i 've never had a man treat me this way . with you , i feel really ... listened to . can i tell you something ? it 's a little embarrassing , but i feel very unguarded with you .

yeah ?

then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning .

i 'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this . how hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old ?

brady peck 's . fourteen years old . lives next door .

so whose route is this ?

no , that 'd be a good story , but that was just the beginning of the end . we went on for another year or so .

it 's pretty obvious to a trained professional .

that was really bad , was n't it ?

yes .

well then , my life has been some kind of huge rip .

all i have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time ... like i 'll think -- 'taking these walks is going to help sofie get better . ' but then i 'll also think -- 'mumford , you just enjoy taking these walks and you 're kidding yourself about the benefits . '

life .

painful lymph glands ? forget fulness ... irritability ... depression ?

well ... i 'm tired all the time , obviously . i always feel like taking a nap . but when i try to sleep , i have trouble . my muscles ache . and my joints . i feel like an old person , or like i did back when i used to work out too hard ... what else ? ...

sorry ... i 'm done .

you have the best answer for everything . you seem so ... hopeful . are you always this sunny ?

hmm , as in -- that 's interesting . sometimes , with enough clues , it 's possible to figure these things out .

back when this started , was there anything unusual happening in your life ? a change of job , of living situation ... a loss of some kind ?

when did you start to feel this way ?

oh , lord . it 's almost too exhausting to tell you ... ... about my exhaustion . i did n't really want to come . i 'm not hopeful right now . but i could n't take the look on my dad 's face . he 's a truly kind person , which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story . he 's the opposite of me , i guess -- all stamina and resolve .

really ?

i said i 'd consider it . nobody owns me . and the last thing was insane . i do n't know what 's wrong with him ... no magazines .

no again ?

these appointments were not my idea , remember .

just chill for a second . look at this guy , it appears he 's actually dead ... but gorgeous .

is n't she amazing ? that is such a wicked look .

that 's not quite what i said --

i knew you would n't answer . i 've been thinking about what you said last time . how me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions . how maybe i ca n't lose the weight , ever ... which we already knew ...

where ? ... the new york times . the first one was -- `` he handles produce well . '' which we already knew ! the point is , you have a lot of the signs .

fuck the community . there was this article my friends and i read . it was `` 25 signs he 's great in bed '' . it was very fascinating .

it 's not going to be me . i 'm giving it up .

pretty creepy , huh ? are you totally disgusted ?

doc , there 's something about what you told me the other night i ca n't get out of my head . it 's driving me batty -- why me ? how did you know you could trust me ?

i 'm honored .

i 've never brought anyone down here before .

all new people start with that ...

that 'd be lily .

but look at me now ...

sounds like you have several .

are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --

does n't matter . you can call me doc .

skip , that 's not much of a secret .

really ?

jerking off ?

you 're concerned that maybe i ca n't be trusted with a secret .

it 's just a thought .

i want to tell you something , doc , but before i do , i need to ask you a question ... because , for me to tell you this thing -- well , i have n't told anybody about this . it 's the biggest secret i 've got .

i wondered what happened to her ...

amazing .

well , there 's lily .

lives downstairs from me . she 's got a great dog named for danny ainge .

well , you know ... that 's the thing . like i said , just about everybody in town works for me . and it 's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you . it 's like an order or something ... and no one -- no one -- asks me .

this is great !

do n't tell me , 'cause i 'm not going to tell you what i 've got .

you moved here from back east and your name is the same as this town . is that right ? far out .

i got ta pee . can i ask you something ? this town is called mumford ... been that way since ... 18 ... 18-0 ... 18-0 ... ... thirteen ! right ? now here 's the question -- your name is mumford , too .

would you like another beer ?

... '' find the need and fill it '' my dad used to say -- i guess a lot of dads say that -- but i did and it just took off .

i do n't have one really . most of the time i 'm faking it . see , i think there 's not much that can be done about most problems ... they 're too complicated , too deep-rooted by the time i hear about them . the most i can do , usually , is look and listen real closely , try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody 's got . if i can get a sense of that , well then , maybe ... just maybe , i can help them out a little .

which examiner did you have ? i probably know him .

they are evil , cursed , they matter not .

excuse me ?

and then killing your sister .

oh yes , of course .

by reading the book of the dead .

the book ! the black book they found at hamunaptra ! imhotep wants it back . said to me it would be worth it 's weight in diamonds .

immune from what ?

oh , hey , how ya doin ' ?

o'connell ! i am going to kill you for this !

let 's make us even , shall we ?

you never were any good with the ladies , o'connell .

none of the above , thank you .

what then ? robbery ? extortion ? kidnapping !

shut-up and gim me your bandolier .

... and how do you say ? those slimy things , in your stomach ?

yeah ?

what just happened ?

-- then perhaps , the golden book of the living can return them to the underworld .

in the necropolis , when i saw him , - alive , ... walking , he called me anck- su-namun . and then in mister burns ' quarters he tried to kiss me .

who needs smart women ? i put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons , allah rest their souls . now straighten up this mess !

forget the bumbling americans , they will be like all the others . without the map to guide them , how can they possibly find hamunaptra ?

and burn the map and retrieve the key .

you think it 'll send this guy back to hell ?

okay , let 's cut to the chase . he 's afraid of cats , what 's that about ?

i 'm willin , to go on a little faith , here .

yeah , i 'm not leavin , this fort for nothin ' .

the hell with that ! i 'm not goin ' nowhere ! we 're safe here .

do you realize , we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years .

i have come to protect my investment , thank you very much .

what are you doing here ?

you lie .

i am an english woman .

and what is he in prison for ?

got what ?

got it !

he 's here ! i saw him ! that thing is here !

it 's everybody 's problem !

there goes that belief again . not me , i am outta here !

the ten plagues ? ... you mean all ten plagues .

yes , they never used it because they feared it so . it 's written , that if a victim of the hom-dai should ever arise , he would bring with him the ten plagues of egypt .

is he supposed to look like that ?

i 'm going to kiss you , mister o'connell .

i may not be an explorer , or an adventurer , or a treasure hunter , or a gunfighter ! mister o'connell but i 'm proud of what i am .

okay , i get your father , i get your mother and i get your brother , but what are you doing here ?

something like that .

you do n't believe in curses , huh ?

you two !

how ?

who was talking about what ?

oh my god , ... it looks like , it looks like a sarcophagus .

what are those mirrors for ?

the things that get you excited .

did i miss something ? are we going into battle ?

if you call that a kiss .

the only thing that scares me , mister o'connell , are your manners .

give ... give him ... give him glaaaa -- !

so who 's the broad ?

and when those dirty yanks go to sleep -- no offense .

according to my calculations , we should be right under the statue . we 'll come up right between his legs . oh my .

ah , begging your pardon , but should n't we be going ?

undoubtedly , i know the breed , he may be a cowboy , but his word is his word .

i lie to everybody , what makes you so special ?

all we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 b.c .

right , right , in a big underground treasure chamber . everybody knows the story . the entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand . on pharaoh 's command , a flick of the switch ! and the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes .

oh yes i do ! i have something right here !

you ... ! you ... !

do something , jonathan ! kill it !

he 's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon .

who 's here ! ?

where 's my gun ?

yes , i 'm all tears , now let 's see who 's inside , shall we ?

and you 're sure you can find the secret compartment ?

hey , ... do n't i know you ?

um-hmm .

i 'll be down in a jiffy .

your mind is so slippery .

it must have slipped my mind .

not quite . you have n't announced our engagement yet .

everything 's going exactly as we planned .

my father had this friend ... he was an inventor ...

look , honey , being a superhero ... it 's a guy thing .

but that place is huge and we do n't know where this psycho thing is --

me , too .

i know ... my girlfriends all dumped me after i put on the mask . they thought i 'd lost it .

but she 's your mother . you got ta tell her .

and you ca n't count horst buckholtz anyway .

sure .

hey ... you okay ?

casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him ... and there was n't a thing that we could do about it .

that 's two more than the fantastic four .

i thought you 'd never ask .

think positive .

thanks .

you know , mr. f , me and the boys always loved workin ' for you . you had such style : the clothes , the dancin ' , the elegant way you 'd snuff a babe . you were the king ...

and the light goes out ...

against .

what ?

sure -- i guess .

really ?

just shut up and listen . hold off the attack as long as you can . if i can discover the location i 'll call you --

you know what ? underneath all that anger i think there 's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him .

me , too .

what have they got that we ai n't got ?

me too ... i love this stupid old town . it 's noisy . it 's smelly . it 's falling apart .

what 's your real name ?

nothing wrong with being a waitress .

it is ?

i admire you .

date ?

alone tonight ?

not tonight .

i know i have n't got it entirely worked out yet , but i 've always dreamed of becoming a superhero ... were n't you guys ever a kid ? did n't you ever need someone to just give you a chance ?

he is in love . his anger is gone .

and a skunk stinks !

but now casanova 's back ! and we 're gon na sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories ! hey , lets toast some marshmellows !

with what ?

because that 's what it is .

there 's a big difference .

how could i see him if he 's invisible ?

i say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know !

what have the famous superheroes got that we do n't ?

what are you talking about ?

we had an off night , that 's all .

he has n't stolen it yet .

who are we kidding ? no one 's gon na show . we 're living in a fantasy !

are you serious ? this is the break we 've been waiting for !

see ya tomorrow .

who 's chicken ?

why do they always fill stuff these things so full you ca n't pull 'em out without ripping 'em !

there 's a vague similarity .

he 's lance hunt ! just take off the glasses -- and it 's him !

hey ... he 's gone .

yes , obie-wan .

no .

you did ?

we 've got lift off !

twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil , and casanova was their king .

but , doc ... where 's the machine guns ?

sorry .

this is bad .

how long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it 's not gon na happen ?

perhaps it would be even more serious than that , your majesty . his european confederation is held together by some very slender threads . your majesty knows even better than i that austria and prussia are very doubtful allies , and the emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him , at the first sign of weakness .

i must confess he would look a bit silly , fighting his way to moscow and turning right around again .

well , that is a very interesting idea , general kutusov , but i can assure you that napoleon is no beginner at this . whatever analysis you have done on this situation , i am sure that he has gone over the same ground .

forgive me , your majesty , i am about to make it .

yes , general kutusov , i daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length . napoleon would simply spend the winter in moscow and continue the campaign in the spring . another lesser possibility might be to march on st. petersburg now , although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this , until he refits his army .

for the sake of your argument , let us say that is correct .

the point i was trying to make is that i think it is reasonable to say that your majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure , if he decided to make peace with the emperor , at least at this time .

i have heard that story but i do not believe it .

proceed .

without a doubt , to estimate the enemy 's strength on the battlefield . this is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct . at jena , there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present . murat said there were 50,000 , preparing to attack . berthier said there were no more than 25,000 , about to withdraw . `` berthier sees only what is in the open , '' murat said . `` but do n't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest . '' and so it would always go , each of them would judge things according to his own ability , character and state of mind , at the moment .

you can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry , because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back . when they are retreating before infantry , they merely trudge along , head down .

whatever suggested the idea to you ?

look , let me be completely open with you , i have a carriage and an escort waiting for me , and i have a great deal of money outside of france . unless we stand a very good chance of carrying this off , i am prepared to call it quits right now .

our lives , the revolution , my career ?

these are odds of 8 to 1 .

well , i believe there are at least 30 guns at sablons .

there are none here .

about 5,000 troops .

to be perfectly honest , i have n't the vaguest idea .

i do n't have to tell you of our latest difficulties .

ah , my dear friend , come in , come in . please sit down .

yes , captain ? have you anything you wish to say ?

but , sire , your majesty would lay paris open to being sacked . the enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men . besides this , i left the city under the terms of a treaty and i am forbidden to reenter paris .

paris has surrendered ? ! i do n't believe it .

i wanted to kiss her , but she did n't want to kiss me ... she slipped away , the moment i wanted to take her in my arms .

she was sitting there ... and it was as if i had last seen her only the night before ... she had n't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me ... and she told me we were going to see each other again and , never again , leave each other ... she has promised me . did you see her ?

i have never heard an unkind word about her spoken .

that is incredible .

let me see it .

to joseph bonaparte -- dear joseph , i have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family , since my departure . i am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money i left with you expressly for this purpose . must you , too , take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the bonaparte family ?

then , you have my thanks , captain charles , for safely escorting madame bonaparte to milan , and you may consider your assignment completed .

no , sir , none at all .

yes , sir .

was the trip normal in every respect ?

i believe you are acquainted with my brother , joseph bonaparte , and my aide , major junot .

i see ...

no , they 're living in nice now .

have you been back recently ?

i thought so , i noticed your name when you were announced . i 'm corsican too -- my name is arena .

yes , sir ?

it is the work of incendiaries .

how did it spread so quickly ?

the first reports came in at about ten .

four o'clock .

oh ?

i beg your indulgence , ambassador , but it is .

a sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for .

yes , sir . are you acquainted with her ?

i 'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle .

oh ... ?

one must take life as it comes -- do you live in lyon , sir ?

oh , i see ... that must be a great burden .

yes , it must be .

yes , it is . it must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter .

i have no idea . her maid said she left two days ago , to meet me -- i can imagine where she is . but when she finally does come home , she will find her things in the street and my door locked .

are you sure that you are not still in love with her ?

my mind is made up . she will not set foot in my house again . i think if i saw her again , i might be tempted to strangle her .

you would tell me , joseph , would n't you ?

and , you seem in excellent health , your highness .

ah , that is good .

i rarely see him , your highness , but i believe he is in excellent health , and he is very happy with the child .

oh , my darling . i 'm sorry , too . i wo n't do that again -- whatever you do . i wo n't cause you any more embarrassment , i promise .

it 's me .

yes .

oh -- now , this is absolutely ridiculous ! if you do n't want to be humiliated in front of your guests , you will return to the table at once .

how should i know . ask roquier -- he 's cleaning her dress .

all right -- i promise .

perhaps -- but tell me you promise , anyway .

promise .

promise me .

no .

of course .

and you , are you in love with any one else ?

oh , you must forgive me , general bonaparte , i 'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but i know absolutely nothing about this . eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more , and he has so many things in his room , i must confess i was n't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be !

oh ... how very nice of you to bring that for eugene ... did general de beauharnais give it to you ?

oh , i do n't want to put you to any inconvenience .

ah , how nice to meet you , general bonaparte . one has read so much about you lately . please sit down .

yes , of course . what do you want ?

how do you know ?

about hippolyte charles .

you wrote it .

what ?

there are some things ... better left unsaid .

look , junot , you are n't going to leave this room until you explain yourself .

that 's all you can say ? what are you talking about ?

yes ... but , first , can i say something to you , as a friend ?

i must have the breakdown now . where is berthier ?

why did you give it to him ?

i am afraid , then , i have to ask you both , joseph as my brother , and junot as my good friend , whether or not you know anything about this , or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it .

if you wish to put things on that basis , then i will say good day to you , monsieur .

may i inform you , monsieur , that i am major fidon , official courier to the court of the emperor napoleon , on my way to our embassy at st. petersburg and , in accordance with the rules of the road , no one may overtake or pass me .

my regrets , my dear major , but i believe you have been blocking the road .

did the emperor or empress give you any ... instructions of any kind ... before you left ?

i only desire what gives you pleasure , my dearest .

yes , my dearest marie-louise , i am your husband .

good evening , ladies . you must forgive me , my dearest wife , but i simply could not wait to see you .

what you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when i gamble , i prefer to gamble on force .

what i am talking about is moderation .

article 46 , calls for the virtual dismemberment of prussia , reducing her population by half and her army to a token force .

monsieur varlac , do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech . now , i order you to come down from the cart .

good day to our brothers-in-arms . have you come to join us ?

come in .

major lavallette to see you , general .

come in .

yes , sir .

if the french army had been commanded at jena and auerstadt by a tailor , the king of prussia would certainly have gained the day .

okay , i know what i want this time .

i know you smoke weed , right ?

that 's okay , unc . i ca n't swim , either .

cash money . they was n't gon na stick me with no 30-year payment plan . that 's for suckas . they got my daddy like that for a cadillac years ago . i got the only house on the block that 's paid for . that 's why i 'm the king around here .

i know ; this a long way from watts . but what i like about living out here is that you do n't hear no helicopters , no sirens , no drive-by 's , no nothing . just peace and quiet . listen .

he has to say `` over and out '' . daddy , you have to say `` over and out '' .

how did you see us kiss ?

nods solemnly . gene reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh .

thanks for the shine .

you 're going to go see her .

thank you .

yeah , now listen . i ca n't mess with these shoes any more or it 's gon na look funny . you go down get yourself something to drink . make sure godzilla there , follows you .

no way , there 's nothing you can do to help me .

the governor . if i could just talk to her ...

one of them is in on it . he might even be in charge . her security is in on it . there 's only one person i know for sure is n't in on it .

what are you supposed to do ?

can i get out to flower street from here ?

i 'll have you out of here in two shakes o ' f a lamb 's tail .

i said i have to do something .

what 's that ? you have to speak up . i 'm a little deaf in this ear . between that and my wooden leg i 'm a mess . compliments of the united states army artillery corps .

goddamnit , you fuckin ' bum , come here !

hey !

do n't be like that . think of me as the moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs .

i do n't want my windshield cleaned .

you killed two men , ben harper .

hm !

you was quotin ' scripture . you said -- you said , `` and a little child shall lead them . ''

and i wo n't never tell about the money .

you got common sense . she ai n't . when you grow up that money 'll be yours . now swear . `` i will guard pearl with my life ... ''

yep ; got ta watch out for pearl , uncle birdie .

and the lord told that man --

but which one of you can say as i can say : i drove a good man to murder because i kept a-houndin ' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint !

yes ! yes !

only she wo n't never let me play with it .

o ' course .

surely . i 'd like to talk to you , my dear .

what do you figure to do ?

you were listening outside the parlor window .

do you want more children , willa ?

i think it 's time we got one thing perfectly clear , willa . marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of heaven .

you thought , willa , that the moment you walked in that door i 'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night . ai n't that right , now ?

i was praying .

he do n't mean no impudence ; do you , boy ? do you , boy ? ah , many 's the time poor brother ben told me about these youngins .

none of your business , madam .

the lord will provide .

gracious , gracious ! you are a good woman , miz cooper !

somewheres down river ! parkersburg , mebbe ! -- cincinnati ! -- one of them sodoms on the ohio river .

where 's she at ?

john and pearl !

he never asked me for nothin ' .

what you been up to ?

this man down at the drugstore ...

not this time ! it was just one youngin -- a little boy babe . and do you know who he was , children ?

how can you tell ?

what happened ? that needle sank like a rock .

mysteries . incredible body hookus pokus . truth is we still do n't know what they are or where they come from . as for nightmares ... did you know that in the last three years twenty filipino refugees in california died in the middle of nightmares ? not from heart attacks , either . they just died .

not to worry . no signs of pathology in nancy 's eeg or pulse rate . i 'd guess what we 've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell .

since the murder . she was fine before that .

please , nancy . trust us .

they 're just simple tests , nan . we 'll both be right here .

i sure as hell hope so .

nightmares are expected after psychological trauma . do n't worry , they go away .

you 're a jock . you must have a baseball bat or something . come to my window at midnight . and meanwhile ...

you do ?

i guess those people do n't wake up to tell what happens .

and what if they meet a monster in their dream ? then what ?

they got a whole system they call 'dream skills ' . so , if you have a nightmare , for instance like falling , right ?

and if you ca n't do that , you sleep .

yeah . so ?

jesus , it 's dark in here .

okay ?

i believe in you , me , and rock and roll . and i 'm not too sure about you lately .

you believe in anything ?

one two , freddie 's coming for you ? no . rod killed tina . he 's a fruitcake and you know it .

well at least i have an objective wall to bounce this off . you believe it 's possible to dream about what 's going to happen ?

m'god , i look twenty years old . you have any weird dreams last night ?

have n't slept , have you ?

you okay ?

oh -- jeez -- glen ! rod 's gone ape !

what the hell 's going on ! ?

glen . not now . i mean , we 're here for tina now , not for ourselves .

it 's just a stupid cat .

dad -- what you doing here ?

no , i know , thanks to your own testimony , that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag .

you used me , daddy !

'anything funny ' like what ?

i do n't mean her --

she lived there .

maybe god 's punishing us all ...

krueger ?

just sleep now , mom .

i want to know how , where -- if you do n't tell me , i 'm going to call daddy .

what 's with the bars ?

what i learned at the dream clinic , that 's what i 'm trying to prove . rod did n't kill tina , and he did n't hang himself . it 's this guy -- he 's after us in our dreams .

yeah . just had a little dream . i 'm falling right back to sleep .

right .

what ?

i will .

right home after .

did you sleep ?

apparently he was crazy jealous . nancy said they 'd had a fight , rod and tina .

no .

we got her mother 's bed . you two got the rest .

came to make up , no big deal . your ma home ?

naturally , comrade .

what is it , anna ?

you feel it , though .

now , ninotchka , you 're exaggerating .

an evening gown .

it was very silly ... . i would be ashamed to wear it here .

no , i left everything in paris . i just happened to be wearing this .

ninotchka , you know i am your friend , you can trust me ... . did you bring back anything else ?

i see .

and you too , ninotchka .

you should be more careful , anna .

well , i 've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we 'll manage .

they did n't let me . i am in disgrace . last week at the performance of carmen i played a sour note . the conductor got so excited he yelled , `` there 's sabotage in the string section ! ''

no , the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade .

... it may step out of a bazaar ... it may wait for you in a corridor ... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret ... .

it is , ninotchka ! it is ! he must have been in paris ! you can see it in his whole attitude ! he just picked up a crumb of our black bread , shook his head , and dropped it .

can you blame them ? ... at least the may day parade is over .

how nicely you 've fixed the table , ninotchka .

you must help us , leon ... if you do n't win her over we 're on our way to siberia !

... and little lady beatrice ?

you would n't like razinin .

all right , let 's uphold it for another ten minutes .

how many families live here with you ?

what a lovely room you have here .

and they might believe her in moscow .

and leonitchka ! what she said about us ... !

for ourselves ... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants ' quarters .

we had to take it on account of the safe .

yes , he looks like a comrade !

that must be the one !

well , gentlemen , i 'm afraid our rates are rather high .

is there anything i can do for you , monsieur ?

shall we tell her ?

do n't forget , the day will come when you will have to face razinin .

i must be stern with you .

it is high time you got out of russia .

let 's not close our eyes . there are many good things to see here too .

comrade buljanoff ...

which part of the room is mine ?

oh , yes , yes .

did n't we put up a strong resistance ?

leon ... leonitchka ... why are you so good to us ?

well , gentlemen , how about my proposition ?

not that we are giving in one inch , but tell us ... what is in your mind ?

very well , your highness .

shall i draw your bath , sir ?

oh , you 're a reactionary ! do n't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say , `` hey , you , d'algout ! from now on it 's going to be share and share alike '' ?

may i add , sir , that it was with great amazement that i found a copy of karl marx 's capital on your night table . that is a socialistic volume which i refuse to so much as dust , sir . i view with alarm , sir , the influence over you of this bolshevik lady .

well , sir , if you should do it again , which i hope you wo n't , please remember the order . counterpane , blanket , blanket , sheet , sheet .

and gaston , i was happier all day long . i felt i 'd contributed something .

have you ?

go to bed .

good evening , monsieur .

you 're looking magnificent , leon ... ... is n't he , general savitzky ?

are they indeed ? thank you .

i want you to know all the white russian exiles in paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels . they are very interested in the case . swana suspects her countrymen .

your highness ...

... it is in the air ... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street ... .

do n't call it desertion . our little restaurant ... that is our russia ... the russia of borscht , the russia of beef stroganoff , blinis with sour cream ...

that was our idea when we first came . all we thought we would get out of this trip was a turkish bath , but ... we learned better .

... des petites fraises des bois ... de la crme de bretagne ...

oh , leon , you are so good .

soviet russia will put all its might behind this case .

what did she say about me ?

razinin .

but how will she look ? the fashions this spring are very becoming to her . gentlemen , the judge will be french , the jury will be french , everybody in that courtroom will be french . have you ever seen a french court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little ? you sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you ?

get out of here !

well , gentlemen ... how about a little lunch ?

i just want a word with monsieur mercier .

look for yourselves .

only myself and two other girls . one is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor .

a day .

how much does this cost ?

right away ... instantly !

but , gentlemen , i am afraid ...

monsieur .

how does this strike you ? commissar razinin , board of trade , moscow . unexpected situation here . duchess swana in paris claims jewels , and has already brought injunction against sale or removal . after long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution . iranoff , buljanoff , and kopalski .

yes ... a very slim one . i want to be fair . i do n't deny that you might make out some kind of a case .

well , we 're back home .

you , comrade iranoff , go to the public library and get me the section of the civil code on property .

we did our best , comrade .

it 's a hat , comrade , a woman 's hat .

why ? ... why should you carry other people 's bags ?

well , there 's nothing we can do about it . why get excited ?

yes . it is unfortunate .

what can i do about it ?

suspicions ... nothing but suspicions ! ... that 's the trouble with you ! if you do n't let me in i 'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from russia ! ... i 'll picket your whole country ... .

what for ... why ?

she must have her little joke . you 're not going to take that seriously .

why should an aristocrat want to go to russia ?

count leon d'algout ... a count ! ... a nobleman !

comrades ! people of the world ! the revolution is on the march ... i know ... wars will wash over us ... bombs will fall ... all civilization will crumble ... but not yet , please ... wait , wait ... what 's the hurry ? let us be happy ... give us our moment ... . we are happy , are n't we , leon ?

thank you , leon ... thank you , masses . can i make a speech now ?

... but big .

there it is ... thursday ... you ca n't rip it out of the week ... .

well , it has to warm up ... you have to give it a chance ... just like people ... like you and me ... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party ... salute !

it 's dead .

yes , sweetheart ... all by ourselves .

what shall we get ? the news !

i have paid the penalty . now let 's have some music .

no ! no !

... and we wo n't clench our fist ...

and we wo n't stretch up our arms ...

do n't tell them where we 're going , sweetheart .

no speech .

they are all duchesses here ... thousands of duchesses ... and i am going to tell them .

now , ninotchka ... please !

do n't shush me . i am people ! i want to make a speech . i want to overthrow the duchess !

oo ! darling ! something is the matter .

it 's always good luck to launch something with champagne ; a battleship ... or an evening .

ninotchka , i love you .

did you make any change in this room ?

leon , i would like to ask you something .

no ... go on .

a wonderful idea ! radio or records ?

it 's nine o'clock .

you remember this room ?

not funny , huh ?

i do n't think so .

i wish they had never met .

well , er ... let 's drop it . i do n't think you would care for that one .

ha ! ha ! now go back .

what ?

oh , ninotchka , who wants to talk business . if you win the suit , fine . if we win the suit , better . you do me an injustice . when we went to my apartment did i have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal ?

what are you after ?

i always eat here .

then how did you get here ?

send me a plate of raw carrots and beets , beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty ... what ? there is a strike in the kitchen ? good ! will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause . i hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables ... what ? you wo n't serve me either ? now look here , comrade , i think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you 're weakening the people .

room service speaking .

but , ninotchka , i held you in my arms . you kissed me !

you know i want to ...

as a representative of moscow ...

i have a better suggestion . let 's forget that the telephone ever rang . i never heard that you are yakushova ... you are ninotchka ... my ninotchka ...

oh , let it ring .

it 's midnight . one half of paris is making love to the other half . look at the clock . one hand has met the other hand . they kiss . is n't that wonderful ?

it 's twelve o'clock .

i was wounded before warsaw .

oh , i see . what do you use instead ?

you are bringing in wrong values . love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological , or shall we say chemical , process . a lot of nonsense is talked and written about it .

your cornea is terrific . tell me -- you 're so expert on things -- can it be that i 'm falling in love with you ?

thank you .

i begin to believe in it myself since i 've met you . i still do n't know what to make of it . it confuses me , it frightens me a little , but it fascinates me , ninotchka .

you are something we do not have in russia .

keeping my body fit , keeping my mind alert , keeping my landlord appeased . that 's a full-time job .

what do we do now ?

well , may i offer you a drink , or how about something to eat ?

is this what you call the `` butler '' ?

well , let 's say i live in it . such a pleasant place ... all kinds of comfort , easy to reach , close to street car , bus , and subway ...

i do not deny its beauty , but it is a waste of electricity .

that 's a strange angle .

a russian ! i love russians ! comrade ... i have been fascinated by your five- year plan for the past fifteen years !

i have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society . it is having a superior earning power that makes you like that .

how long does it take a man to land ?

technical ... i could n't help you from that angle . you see , a real parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off .

i am interested in the eiffel tower from a technical standpoint .

love to .

have you never been caught in a similar situation ?

yes . could you give me some information ?

that does it , swana . now you must n't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser .

count d'algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him i 'll be delighted .

i have to be simple again , swana , and you may find it shockingly banal . i 've thought it over and i 'm willing to take all the consequences , even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living .

it must be serious , swana . not long ago i 'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class . now i can say it without stammering , without a blush . i 'm in love , swana .

there are a hundred ways to approach it , but i feel it can best be said in one simple phrase . i 'm in love , swana .

this time , swana -- just this once -- i must ask you to listen .

no thanks , swana .

a very wise suggestion , leon . i 'm afraid madame and i will never agree . the only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week . i understand everything will be over by thursday . am i right ?

there 's a charming crowd here tonight , is n't there ?

poor madame yakushova ... here we are talking in mysteries ... . i 'm sure you wonder what it 's all about .

i 've some wonderful news for you , leon . it 's about punchy ... do you mind if i sit down ?

timeless . when she comes into a room you 'd think that the bolsheviks had taken over paris . she wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by schiaparelli . what a woman ! what a woman ! there is a russian snowstorm in each of her eyes .

imagine the carpets of a self- respecting parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik ! what does she look like ?

i just could n't sleep . i got up and went back ... and then got up again . these last few days ... whew !

no .

shhh ! ... but how can there be a question ? ... are you my lawyer or theirs ? ... all right , i 'll let you know !

darling , this would be wonderful ! just once ... were n't you attacked by a bolshevik ?

you 'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the guizots .

we can be rich if you say the word . i had dinner with the guizots last night .

now , let 's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way . our situation has changed considerably . before i had only a claim to the jewels . now i have the jewels .

do n't worry . fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open . perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a russian . i just put this on for sentiment . the rest are absolutely safe . i assure you . but if you feel like notifying the police ...

you ca n't deny we gave the people their money 's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling romanoffs -- eight !

it is not enough to be witty , madame . people grow tired of being entertained . you made that mistake before . problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony .

very interesting , my dear , but could n't you write all that from moscow ? a dissertation on love on soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox .

people can not be taken away , madame , neither a hundred and sixty million nor one . not if you have their love . you had n't . that 's why you 're not in russia any longer , and that 's why you came here this morning .

i must ask you to leave .

do n't worry , you were quite rude enough . do you mind if i let in a little fresh air and sunshine ? i 'm sure it will make you feel better and i want you to be at your very best . in full possession of your faculties , at least .

good morning .

well ... that 's my business , madame .

may i have your bags , madame ?

i will do my best .

i do n't understand .

it gives details which could n't be invented . naturally i want to verify it and that 's why i need you .

cigarette ?

i think this is the first time you have been to my little place . your face is new to me . now , what shall it be ?

this will do .

this way , madame . are you alone ? by the window perhaps ? or a nice little corner table ?

never . i never said that about jews !

frankly , sir , it stinks . i have no access . i 'm lucky helms lets me have a staff .

uh , he 's rushing back from his tennis game , sir ...

john , you do n't want to start down that road . i remember what whittaker chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said , `` on the road of the informer , it 's always night . '' this is beyond you or even me . it 's the country , john . it 's the presidency .

i mean , who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit . goldwater put it right . he said : `` well for christ 's sake , everybody bugs everybody else ; we know that . '' ... it 's the cover-up , not the deed that 's really bad here . if only mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it ; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they wo n't come back for the main course . that 's the tragedy of all this . mitchell 's going to get it in the neck anyway . it 's time he assumed some responsibility .

hunt has nothing to lose now . pardon all of them . nobody 's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned .

then what about this washington post crap ? woodwind and fernstein ?

john , sooner or later -- sooner , i think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to richard nixon . that he 's the darkness reaching out for the darkness . and eventually , it 's either you or him . look at the landscape of his life and you 'll see a boneyard .

to protect his people .

in richard nixon 's long history of underhanded dealings , he has never gotten better value for his money . if i were to open my mouth , all the dominoes would fall .

is it ?

i 'll bet he would .

dick nixon saying `` i 'm sorry '' ? that 'll be the day . the whole suit of armor 'd fall off .

you think this is just about politics ?

he 's wrong , you know -- about kennedy , lbj , truman .

why me ?

yeah ... sullivan thinks henry 's leaking . he 's the one ...

executive privilege will make it look like we 're covering up .

no , no . he 's our only `` star '' right now . he 'd go crying straight to the press . he 'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch ! get someone from our staff on his ass . tap his phones . i want to know everyone he talks to .

i would personally enjoy doing that , sir .

no , you did n't , bob .

the country 's loving it .

the soldiers were provoked . the students started it , for christ 's sake !

we ca n't touch hoover --

no ... i can do this because i 've spent my whole career building anti communist credentials .

i will not go down as the first american president to lose a war ! going into cambodia , bombing hanoi , bombing laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the south vietnamese a fighting chance .

oh , i suppose you would 've just let them take over . these are n't fraternity pranks , john . it 's anarchy . a revolution !

we should set up a cuban defense fund on this ; take care of all of them .

uh , we 've never done this before , sir ... how do we pay ? in ... hundreds ? do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills ?

what the hell are you doing , ehrlichman ? screwing with the cia ? i do n't care how much he wants -- pay him .

sure . lyndon , jfk , fdr -- i mean , truman cut the shit out of my investigation of hiss back in '48 .

well , he 's photogenic . let 's try dog bones ?

well , sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still , you see , on our white house payroll .

i do n't have time for all this shit ! just handle it , bob ! keep it out of the white house . what else ? kissinger 's waiting -- he 's gon na throw a tantrum again if i do n't see him , threatening to quit ... again .

find out what the hell he was doing at `` creep . '' this could be trouble . these cia guys do n't miss a trick . this could be a set-up .

martha 's an idiot , she 'll do anything to get john 's attention . if mitchell 'd been minding the store instead of that nut martha we would n't have that kid magruder runnin ' some third-rate burglary ! was he smoking pot ?

that smell . i mean , everybody suffered so much , their sons killed . they need to sacrifice something , y'know , appease the gods of war -- mars , jupiter . i am that blood , general . i am that sacrifice , in the highest place of all ... all leaders must finally be sacrificed .

... you mentioned the `` bay of pigs '' several times . sooner or later they 're going to want to know what that means . they 're going to want to know what was on that gap ...

the army ?

sir , the deadline is today .

it 's totally out of context . i was protecting the national security . i never intended --

... an action that will at last , once and for all , show that what i knew and what i did with regard to the watergate break-in and cover-up were just as i have described them to you from the very beginning ...

a dozen ? i got half of 'em elected . i still got the south and goldwater and his boys . i 'll take my chances with the senate .

about a dozen .

for what ? !

congress is considering four articles of impeachment , sir .

at least mitchell stood up to it .

mr. hoover was a realist .

this is june twentieth ?

for god 's sake , when does this end ? !

he 'll give us the documents . but i think he should be offered the ambassadorship to iran . then he 'll go without a whimper .

what about the documents he promised ?

... i was wondering what 's such dynamite in this bay of pigs story ? ... although it was clearly effective , because all of a sudden it was no problem for helms to go to the fbi and try to put a lid on watergate .

you know why they 're turning on me ? they 're not serious about power , that 's why . they 're playing with power . they 're forgetting the national interest . in the old days , people knew how to hold power , how to set limits . they would n't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary . all they care about now are their egos , looking good at cocktail parties ...

why would they ? ! who the hell 's sulzberger anyway ? their parents are gold traders from eastern europe . they buy things . they come to jew york city and they buy up things . one of the things they buy is the new york times . and you know what ? be proud because they 'll never trust you , sir , because we speak for the average american .

we ought to fire his whining ass . right now when he 's on top . you know what -- it 'll set the right example for the rest of this administration .

this could be it ... this could be it . four long years ...

the jews are n't the middle , henry . they 're the far left .

but , hell , this is nothing compared to venezuela . when i was vice president , ike sent me down there like a blocking back . they threw rocks , broke out our windows , almost overturned the car . read six crises , bob . boy , pat was brave !

do n't forget the south , sir , the west . filled with the good football colleges , straight kids . there 's more of 'em with you than against you . not like these mudmutts .

there 's a poison in the upper classes , bob . they 've had it too soft . too many cars , too many color tvs ...

get that little fucker ! great tackle ! reminds me of my days at whittier . most of these kids are useless .

if they did n't tell kennedy about track 2 , how did hoover find out ?

you never told him ?

... he 'd just found out about track 2 .

because he did n't even know about it . the cia never told him , they just kept it going . it was like ... it had a life of its own . like ... a kind of `` beast '' that does n't even know it exists . it just eats people when it does n't need 'em anymore . two days after the bay of pigs , kennedy called me in . he reamed my ass ...

cue the crowd . go to the woman 's group . get the bald guy , he 's great ...

... an open invitation for mr. khrushchev to become involved in latin america . we would lose all our friends in latin america .

i think ... i think ... that 's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the cuban exiles who oppose castro would , uh ... not only be a violation of international law , it would be ...

how is this national security ?

he 'll need a pretext . he 'll never figure one out for himself .

no , keep trini out of this . chotiner 's too old . and for god 's sake , keep colson out . it 's time to baptize our young counsel . that means dean can never talk about it . attorney-client privilege . get to it . and dean -- you stay close on this .

`` security '' is not strong enough .

but , sir , you 're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned watergate . we 're clean . it 's only the ellsberg thing , and if that comes out , it 's `` national security . ''

howard hunt ? ... jesus christ , you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus .

howard hunt is working for the white house ? no shit ! this is goddamn disneyland ! since when ?

that fruitcake ! what about him ?

please ! i 'll never let you down again , mother . never . i promise .

relax , dick , it 's just me ... the desert 's so beautiful , is n't it ? i want to go home , dick . time to go home .

what 'd he say ?

you must be familiar with my favorite poem by yeats ? `` the second coming '' ?

flowers are continual reminders of our mortality . do you appreciate flowers ?

i never thought jack was ready for the presidency . but i would never , never consider ... his death was awful , an awful thing for this country . do you ever think of death , mr. helms ?

so president kennedy thought .

cuba would be a small price to pay .

this is an extremely dangerous direction , mr. president . terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement .

is that why you and kissinger are negotiating with the chinese ?

are you tapping kissinger ?

yes .

mr. castro .

it will take a little time , but i 'll order a search for your papers . though it does raise a disturbing issue .

and of course i accept . i 'm flattered . and i want you to know , i work for only one president at a time .

firing you , mr. helms , would n't do any good . of course you 'll continue as dci . you 're doing a magnificent job .

and me ? ...

the president would support a reasonable request for an increase .

diem ? trujillo ? lumumba ? guatemala ? cuba ? ... it 's a shame you did n't take similar precautions , dick .

i 'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area , mr. president , given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...

then find something . and i want these leaks stopped . jack fucking anderson , the new york times , the state department -- i want to know who 's talking to them .

i suppose , `` mister president , '' you 're unhappy that we have not implemented your domestic intelligence plan , but ...

this damned tie ... will you help me , edgar ? churchill used to say to me , `` if you want your own history written properly , you must write it yourself . '' all right , edgar , but just do n't let it come back to haunt me .

yeah , you do . i 'd be bugging myself , edgar ... who 'd get the tapes ?

kissinger ?

the little bastards think they can ruin tricia 's wedding day by dancing naked in the reflecting pond .

yeah , well , as i said , edgar ...

it could be '60 all over again , edgar . bobby 's got the magic , like a goddamn rock star . they climb all over each other just to touch his clothes ! he 'll ride his brother 's corpse right into the white house .

you 'll win the nomination .

roselli ? johnny roselli ?

how about you ? are you going to win ?

my father built the house where i was born with his own hands . oh , it was n't a big house ...

it was the poorest lemon ranch in california , i can assure you . my father sold it before they found oil on it .

so , does tricky dick know about this ?

just do n't tell him to do anything you do n't really want him to do .

where 'd you find him ?

a guy named gordon liddy . thinks he 's martin borman . you wan na meet him ?

the white house .

let 's get the fuck out of here , shall we , ladies ?

mein kampf ?

well , goddamn . are you threatening me , dick ?

what do you mean , jack ?

it looks like to me we 're gon na lose the war for the first goddamned time and , dick , goddamn it , you 're going along with it , buying into this kissinger bullshit -- `` detente '' with the communists . `` detente '' -- it sounds like two fags dancing .

it 's me or wallace , jack . wallace 's third party is only going to help mcgovern . i need your support .

that sonofabitch kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow . dick , we 're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money ' n you ever dreamed of .

agreed .

he 's all business , ai n't he , trini ? dick , we could 've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal . we brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...

she 's quite pretty .

oh god , i 'm going to throw up .

... because people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook . well , i am not a crook . i have never made a dime from public service ...

that does n't matter now , henry . the point is , you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry .

all kinds of shit would come out . like the ellsberg thing . you knew about that , henry , did n't you ?

we have to entertain the possibility ...

mr. president , this can not be breathed ! especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin rogers ... the chinese would never trust us again . the only way , i emphasize only way , to pull this off is in secret .

exactly , yes , mr. president . that is my contention .

i did n't ask what your staff thinks , henry . what do you think ?

well , as you know , most of my staff have weighed in against this `` incursion . '' they believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily , and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...

churchill , degaulle , disraeli . they all went through the pain of losing power .

... as the old alliances crumble .

we 're gon na hit him so hard he looks like everything that 's sick and evil about the eastern establishment . you and your `` plumbers '' are gon na find dirt on this guy -- let 's see him going to the bathroom in front of the american public ! and when we finish with him , they 'll crucify him !

... and what do we get for it ? gobs and gobs of bullshit , gossip , nothing ! someone is leaking . we 've got to stop the leaks , henry , at any cost , do you hear me ? then we can go for the big play -- china , russia .

he was , he was . we taught a class together at harvard . but you know these back-stabbing ivy league intellectuals , they ca n't ...

secret , mr. chairman ?

i do n't know . he made me see the stars ...

why ?

yes .

you 're too modest , nixon . you 're as evil as i am . we 're both from poor families . but others pay to feed the hunger in us . in my case , millions of reactionaries . in your case , millions of vietnamese .

i was the lesser of two evils .

we know you 've taken a great risk in inviting us here .

looks can be deceiving ...

i must say you look very good , mr. chairman .

kissinger 's misunderstood . he pretends to be a liberal for his establishment friends , but he 's even tougher than i am ...

how about kissinger along with him ?

we 're gon na get rid of him -- allende , i mean -- just as fast as we can . he 's on the top of the list .

how do you know that , john ? did we try ? are we just giving up like the rest of 'em ? what 's hoover found , for god 's sake ?

four . two boys . two girls . and eight wounded .

that 'll be the day .

you 're the one who should be in politics , john . you 're tougher than i am . you never crack .

talks all day , too ! how the hell can you put up with her , john ?

hiss was protecting his wife . i 've always believed that .

but i would n't have if hiss had n't lied about knowing chambers . the documents were old and out of date , like these pentagon papers . the key thing we proved was that hiss was a liar . then people bought it that he was a spy . it 's the lie that gets you .

and dick beat the shit out of them .

we can prosecute the new york times , go for an injunction ...

... somebody should shoot the little bastard .

but change always comes slowly . i 've withdrawn more than half the troops . i 'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years . i want an all-volunteer army . but it 's also a question of american credibility , our position in the world ...

right , right . i used to play a little ball myself at whittier . of course , they used me as a tackling dummy .

she must be very attractive . would she like an autograph ? she might remember me ... where 's trini ?

uh , is your mother ... still alive ?

yeah ... guy lombardo ...

i like jazz ...

... i do n't really know you yet , sandy ... what do you like ? i mean , what kind of clothes do you like ? do you like blue ... red ?

no , no . i 'm not powerless . because ... because i understand the system . i believe i can control it . maybe not control it totally . but ... tame it enough to make it do some good .

we did n't come here to talk about football . we came here to end the war .

well , we could delete it .

and this ? ! good lord , have you lost your mind ? nixon ca n't say this . `` niggers '' !

pows . and their families .

shit , plenty of people did their best writing in prison . gandhi , lenin ...

you know , fred , they sell tickets .

who the fuck are they ? bob , are you working on revoking the posts 's television license ? good .

bernstein .

no , they want you , mr. president . i really think it would be a good move .

no ... it 's just going to start now ... if i could just ... if i could just ... sleep .

no . they 're not yours . they are you . you should burn them .

and what would i find out that i have n't known for years . what makes it so damn sad is that you could n't confide in any of us . you had to make a record ... for the whole world .

you do n't expect me to believe that for one minute , do you ? does it matter what 's on them ? really ? ... murder , dick ? sex ? your secrets , your fantasies ? or just me and you and ...

thank you ? dick , sometimes i understand why they hate you .

brezhnev 's coming in three days . i do n't want to deal with them . and him . and you .

hiding what ?

no .

ron told me that bob haldeman 's been calling . but you wo n't talk to him ... if he 's convicted , will you pardon him ?

it 's not the press that matters . nixon 's wife is proud of him .

penny for your thoughts .

but they never will , dick . no matter how many elections you win , they never will .

sometimes i think that 's what you want .

yeah , sure , a long time ago .

i asked him , `` lyndon , what would you do , on a scale of one to ten ? '' and he said , `` bomb the shit out of hanoi , boy ! bomb them where they live . '' ... john , do you think i was too soft on tv ?

this is just what they want , buddy . do n't you see it ? they want to drive us apart . to beat us . we ca n't let them do it . we 've been through too much together , buddy ... we belong together .

what are you saying ? what are you talking about ?

buddy , before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again , you should remember : people vote not out of love , but fear . they do n't teach that at sunday school or at the whittier community playhouse !

you 're not going to blame this on castro , are you ?

i know ...

hiya , fellow ... what were they ?

write . you know , a book . i 'm calling it `` six crises . '' it 's a good thing , rocky -- take some time off to write .

won or lost ?

oh , happy ! dick nixon ... you remember him .

you ca n't stop what 's comin . ai n't all waitin ' on you .

nineteen zero and nine .

when did he die ?

she just told me you was quittin ' . sit down .

you lookin ' at it . i got to say you look older .

that do n't hardly say it . he shoots the desk clerk one day , and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel .

he 's real all right .

i 'm not sure he 's a lunatic .

... i do n't know what i do feel like .

no id in her room ?

yes ma'am , i do .

these people will kill him , carla jean . they wo n't quit .

some pretty bad people .

yessir .

okay .

well then i guess i can skip it . heavens to betsy , wendell , you already put me off my breakfast .

i do n't know . any new bodies accumulated out there ?

well i do n't either !

yessir . was n't none .

i do n't know . he ought to ...

... now that 's aggravating .

but you do n't believe it .

that 's possible .

mm .

yes , appears to have been a glitch or two .

i 'd say it is . not a doubt in my mind .

you want me to wait til you 've quit the building ?

i 'll call loretta when i get there . i 'd call now but she 'll want me to come home and i just might .

... how 'd you sleep ?

what do you think .

okay .

maybe i 'll go ridin .

i never do .

do n't get hurt .

i put it in , mama .

your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm 's way . instead , he used you to try to save himself .

that do n't make sense . you gave your word to my husband to kill me ?

you gave your word ?

she 'll be all right .

what makes you say that ?

hey .

you should be used to that .

i got a bad feelin ' , llewelyn .

you ca n't afford one ?

goin ' where ?

goin ' out .

llewelyn .

big talk .

i need to know that .

what 'd you give for that thing ?

what ? quit hollerin ' .

at the gettin ' place .

if you knew , you would have it with you .

hello ?

sir i ai n't at liberty to give out no information about our residents .

where does he work ?

where does he work ?

i do n't know .

what airport would you use .

how 'd you find it ?

not a bleep .

mm-hm .

yes , i do . i think you do too . so this is what i 'll offer . you bring me the money and i 'll let her go . otherwise she 's accountable . the same as you . that 's the best deal you 're going to get . i wo n't tell you you can save yourself because you ca n't .

yeah ? where am i ?

... i know where you are .

who is this .

i see .

yes .

do n't put it in your pocket . it 's your lucky quarter .

sir ?

look ... i got to know what i stand to win .

call it ?

the most . you ever lost . on a coin toss .

sir ?

why would you be comin ' back ? we 'll be closed .

sir ?

generally around dark . at dark .

yessir .

will there be anything else ?

is that what you 're asking me ? is there something wrong with anything ?

with anything ?

i do n't know . will there ?

... will there be somethin ' else ?

i was just passin ' the time .

you get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on ?

okay .

let me have that one . where 's the nearest hardware store ?

never mind . i want a tent .

tent poles .

twelve gauge . you need shells ? moss looks the gun over .

it 's all right .

i do n't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here , buddy .

can i get my parking ticket validated ?

yes ?

... i 'm wondering ...

yessir .

you seem pretty sure of the date . did i ask you to sit ?

when did you last see him .

that 's me .

no , one forty-two .

another additional .

you want to change rooms ?

he do n't talk as much as you , i give him points for that .

no no . no . you do n't understand . you ca n't make a deal with him . even if you gave him the money he 'd still kill you . he 's a peculiar man . you could even say that he has principles . principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that . he 's not like you . he 's not even like me .

to kill your wife .

why would he go to odessa ?

so was i .

cast iron ?

acetylene ? mig ? tig ?

i 'm retired .

took me about three hours .

chigurh . anton chigurh . you know how he found you ?

no sir . i 'm a veteran .

do n't jack with me .

i ask questions . if i get sensible answers then they get to go to america . if i do n't get sensible answers they do n't . is there anything about that that you do n't understand ?

i do n't know .

well , you should find out . she keeps talking about them ...

godammit , betty ! ... who 's chloe ?

i 've got the working gun , elden , me ! you wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there .

you wan na see if he has more shells , go ahead . i say we wait ...

you got ta go , we 're pinned down !

i 'm not going out there ! let 's wait for the real police ...

fuck you , roy ostrey !

i know plenty .

i just got something off the wire . the woman who owns it was murdered last night . now , i 'm not saying i agree with you or nothing , but ... what else do you know ?

no , i did n't have to .

she said she was in arizona , did she ?

listen ! i saw 'chloe ' and 'lonnie ' on t.v . they 're television characters .

tell him what you told me .

you just do n't know when to quit , roy ! you were jealous of me when i got hall monitor in seventh grade , and you 're still jealous now ! ! !

oww , the arm , the arm !

anyway , so what ?

... and half the other guys in this town . including you , i believe ...

i questioned joyce about all this ...

did you send anyone out there ?

yes it was . betty saw the whole thing ! your killer 's name is chloe ...

you need to get yourself gone from my crime scene . and leave betty alone , she 's ...

okay , let 's go ... i got nothing for the record yet .

mind your own business . you just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer , anyway ...

and you should keep your nose out of another man 's omelette ... it 's no big deal , betty .

it 's fine . mind your own meal ...

uh-huh . anyway , i 'm thinking easter , 'cause i just fucking love pastels .

oh . how come ?

you know , flags and shit ... he said `` for a livelier look '' or something .

yes ... not the actor , though , the doctor . i think .

if we went out that window right now we 'd have a chance ...

i 'm sorry .

i know . i borrowed it from your grandparents because i ... i ... it does n't matter . do n't worry , they 're fine ... look , i used to feel that same way , said practically those same words , sitting at night in a foxhole in korea ... i 've chased you across the country , betty , and i come to find out we 're a lot more alike than you 'd think .

i 'm appreciably older than you , but my health is good . i take care of myself , and i got some money socked away . you 'd never have to work again , that 's for sure . i 'd treat you like a queen .

... i never meet people like you . i 'm a garbageman of the human condition . i deal with trash , mostly , people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives . but you ... you 're different .

damn , life is strange . i had you figured for this cold-blooded , calculating bitch -- not that i did n't admire you for it .

do you know why i 'm here ?

... i s'pose you did that so i could take my sweater off or something .

well , i certainly would have heard about that .

dr. ravell 's the finest surgeon on the staff . you must know him . he 's incredibly handsome , gentle , considerate . he 's being sued for sexual assault right now , but -- it 's not true . he was set up .

do what ?

i got ta go make dinner .

sorry , hon . happy birthday ...

uh-huh . no , we 'll do it later . 's only a birthday , right ? i 'll have another one next year ...

you sure ? maybe next week we could ...

it 's all right .

no ... what about your sister ?

honey , i 'm really sorry , i was gon na call you about tonight . larry 's got a lodge meeting . there 's no way i can get a sitter this fast .

oh , betty --

sure did . i 'll tell you , if that man was any better looking it 'd be a crime ' a some sort ...

... it 's too bad you 're such an asshole . 's the only thing that del was ever right about .

oh . of course ... sorry .

... what ? what did you call me ? george ... mccord . you 're my favorite actor on ...

who put you up to this ? did my ex- wife ask you to ... ?

well , i do n't know what you had in mind , but i hope you 're happy . i put myself on the line for you , my reputation , and you 're making me look like an idiot .

in fact , i want you to ad lib , that 's the magic i 'm after . i wan na give a whole new feel to the show .

thanks . but i 'd like to hear what you 're feeling ...

yeah , i felt that way , too , when i first started , but now ... the hours , the repetition ... it 's not all glamour and mall openings anymore . maybe i should 've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier , i do n't know ... ... i just hope it 's not too late for me . god ! listen to me , `` me , me , me . '' it 's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself . stop , right ? that 's it , no more about me tonight , i promise ... let 's talk about you ... what do you think about me ? i 'm kidding ... seriously , betty , i 'm doing all the talking here ...

no , i would have remembered that name . the only stella i ever knew was a parrot . was this before leslie ? before us ? ...

she 's a little jealous , i think . and confused when it comes to men ... so where are we going ?

at last ! i know how much you want this . you 're gifted and extremely determined , but ... it 's not up to me .

wow ... you just gave me goosebumps , you know that ? you make it all sound so real . great improv ...

i know that . i ca n't tell you how many times i 've said that to myself in those exact words .

that 's very kind of you .

i do n't know .

well , are you gon na answer me ? what 'd you come here for ?

it 's people with no lives watching other people 's fake lives .

couple ' a guys in from outta town . they want to see the new lesabres .

... well , then you ai n't got much .

... like the water purifiers ?

what 's so special about it ?

oh , that ... sure , i saw the whole thing . it was disgusting !

to tell you the truth , i ca n't believe i 've made it this far . it may not be europe , but i just know there 's something special out there for me ...

ellen , this is the biggest thing i 've ever done , but i 've got ta do it .

what if you ca n't find him ? what if you get out there , and nothing 's the way you thought it was gon na be ?

i 'll go to the hospital .

no , i mean david ravell . he 's a surgeon .

dr. david ravell .

what 's his real name ?

did you love it ?

williams , arizona . about halfway there , i guess .

shut up , merle ... williams .

he 's a prick . merle ? ... you 're a prick .

what 's the matter here ?

i do n't think so . rosa , i did n't kill del ... they did .

your husband ? !

you think i 'm crazy , rosa , but you do n't know the half of it . my husband was , ahh ...

... this is your sweater , right ?

all the time . it 's always `` loma vista '' this , `` loma vista '' that .

i have , lots of times . my mother used to clean them . i used to piss in their pools .

oh , my gosh , everything ! my trip out here , what we 've both been doing , you know ...

does he know you think he 's real ?

you still in love ?

oh , it 's a charity dinner . the money goes to a good cause , but i do n't have anybody to go with ...

... okay .

do n't worry , i 'm looking ... just taking a tiny break .

either you 're making a fool out of me because you get off on it , or you got serious problems . which one is it ? !

how many men have i talked to ?

david is n't hiding from me , i left him standing at the altar six years ago and now i 'm ...

jesus , i thought my love life was crazy ...

her 'head ' ? ! you 're making this up ...

hey , rosa ... it 's betty . how do you get to this town called 'tustin ? ' it 's in orange county ...

no , this one was worse ... i had to have the place sprayed when he left . twice ... he was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there , which i 'm trusting you with , 'cause if it gets out , i 'm on the street ...

no , that 's not , i could n't ...

lonnie , it 's a complex procedure . why do n't you observe ?

we need someone with the right kind of experience , lonnie .

what can i do for you , gentlemen ?

well , my idea of stupid is very different from yours . so here 's how this is gon na work . would you take your socks off , please ?

driving their cars into trees ... puking on the sidewalk ... stupid shit !

like what ?

the indians , injuns , whatever . they 're always drunk and doing stupid things .

you did not just say `` injuns , '' del .

hmmmm . `` five stars , '' huh ? is that stupid , wesley ?

you 're not a dumb fuck , are you , del ?

i like this . i like doing business in the home . it 's cozy ... who 's birthday ?

yep , betty pours a pretty mean cup .

oh , yes , with the coffee ...

what 's wrong with you ?

no ... if we do n't finish this job , how are we gon na look at ourselves in the mirror ? this is it for me , wesley , she 's the last one . my instinct says i got ta see this through with her , and if there 's one thing i 've tried to teach you here --

we could do that . i could be on my way to florida , and you could go to thailand and fuck your brains out .

you made your point ... i was wrong .

... yeah , i got it . come on , you 're stretching out my vest ...

fuck the profile ! that 's the same guy ! !

a doctor on the show ... why ?

i need to get my goddamn head examined . you ca n't rule something out on a whim . or because she 's cute . i 've been following your whims all across the u.s. of a. and now i 'm tired ! me !

you need to remember who you 're talking to ...

you gim me this bullshit psychic friends theory , you believe that dumbshit trucker , you believe this woman ...

what does n't ?

no , no , betty came here strictly for business , 'cause it 's the biggest market for what she 's selling . i should have known it all along . i 'm kicking myself as i shave here . so , first thing we ...

that 's good . you 're learning . but let me tell you why i know she was lying . first off , betty would never fall for a soap star . it 's beneath her .

this does n't look like the kind of place betty would go to .

i 'm not telling 'til you straighten up . you been acting like fucking jerry lewis on me and this shit 's got ta stop or you can forget about your betty ... i mean it .

every american should see the grand canyon . are you an american ?

i said , 'no . ' n-o .

we do n't have time to look at a hole in the ground . we can make vegas in four hours . this one 's got to be her .

that was a really shitty thing to do .

what the hell 's the matter with you ?

well , i should be in florida now ! if carl had n't gone in to get those stones removed , you would n't be here and i 'd be on my way to the keys . on my boat , relaxing with a glass of port ! ! re-ti red !

do i deserve this ? in the twilight of my career , do i deserve this ? i do n't think so ! i 've always tried to do what 's right . i never took out anybody who did n't have it coming . i 'm a professional ! and where the fuck am i ? i 'm in purgatory !

they said find it . find her , find it . finish the job you were paid to do .

okay , thank you , goodbye ... keep in touch ...

oh , for chrissakes . it just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining , then cut their momma 's throat and go dancing the same night .

joyce was screwing del .

so she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day .

we do n't . but a '97 le sabre 'll be easy to find if it 's here , town this size ... he said he gave his wife some car as a gift , remember ?

well , no one ever spit in my face before . especially some cracker fuck .

wait . any last words , general lee ?

mmmm . well , it was a piece of luck running into you , duane . i thought i was gon na have to take wesley out and hose him down . all he talks about is those japanese gals .

... that 's a good motto .

let me tell you something . in our business you ca n't put food on the table if your phone does n't ring . the guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy , just good . they get in , they get out . nobody knows a goddamn thing . understand ? boom , boom , boom . three in the head and you know they 're dead .

why not , it 'll confuse 'em ... got ta do something , now that you fucked it up .

it 's not here . let 's go .

what the hell does that mean ? if i 'd told a ty cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat ?

well , why 'd you have to tell that indian story ?

i had to shoot him ! it was the only decent thing to do .

it sure is ! !

now , that 's really stupid .

that is so right .

relax , we brought the cash .

hey ... you got a fine one right here !

beer , please .

mrs. blaine ? i can tell you right now , without a doubt , that your granddaughter is alive , and did not kill del sizemore .

if anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed , it would have been me .

what do you mean ?

very graceful . perfect form .

no ... she just wanted something outta life . anything . and with del , she was n't getting nothing . that 's her husband , del . i 'm sorry about what happened and all , but that 's the way i feel about all of this ...

hmm ... you two in high school together ?

`` injuns ? ''

okay , uh ... the , umm , injuns 're stupid .

really ?

seems like a nice place .

yeah , well , i do n't have time to screw around . i got buyers in dallas , houston and vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up .

huh ? oh , umm , a car . so , to a successful transaction ...

then do as you 're told . get her back .

you fucked it up . who would n't freeze in those circumstances ? and i do n't care what her problems are . she would n't be the first one in that cast with problems . we have nothing to lose by making her an offer .

this story is beyond belief , which is perfect for us . it 's free advertising and it 's gon na run for months .

actually , she was my discovery ... just like you .

i 'll think about it .

i 'll tell the cast ahead of time . what do you say ?

we know that ...

yeah , bring your friend along . i 'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do ...

oh fuck ...

what are you talking about ? killing 's totally natural . it 's dying that is n't natural ...

because it ai n't natural , young man .

names , a phone number , something ... listen , ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from detroit was murdered , but do you see him doing anything about it ? if ballard was n't such a stubborn ass , i would n't have to be breaking in here ...

i do n't know what you think you 'll find , anyway .

ahh , i hate this town ! places like this just make you small ... i should have never come back here after college .

no ... before that .

you 'd like that would n't you ? you 've hated betty since you were in pep squad together ...

god , that sounds so familiar . ravell , ravell ... where 's he out of ?

betty . it 's o.k . except i 'm worn out . we spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy . how can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself ?

you lie , motherfucker ...

shut up ! shut the fuck up , both of you , before i kill you !

is this neighborly life insurance ?

huh ?

i see . did chloe testify ?

are n't they precious ? ma'am , she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband . does she have any relatives in the area ?

thankee boys for throwin ' in that fricasee . i 'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt i was feeling a mite peckish .

once again we find ourselves in agreement . what kind of work do you do , big dan ?

the law . well the law is a human institution .

- and share one of your graves .

huh ? !

all except fer our a-cump-uh-nust !

gopher , everett ?

' n i 'm delmar o'donnell .

that ai n't it !

we 'll go fetch it with ya , everett .

i guess vernon t. waldrip is gon na be goin ' on relief . maybe i 'll be able to throw a little patronage his way , get the man a job diggin ' ditches or rounding up stray dogs .

well , you ' n me ' n pete ' n tommy are gon na be the power behind the throne so to speak .

oh my god !

so - where 's all the money from your armored-car job ?

well that 's right ! if then ! believe me , delmar , woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man !

well , uh , i - i got ta get the family farm back before i can start thinkin ' about that .

deceitful ! two-faced ! she-woman ! never trust a female , delmar ! remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent !

well if that is pete i am ashamed of him . the way i see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a babylon . these things-

i just do n't think it 's right , keepin ' him under wraps like we 's ashamed of him .

... i 'm not sure that 's pete .

caintcha see it everett ! them sigh- reens did this to pete ! they loved him up an ' turned him into a horney- toad !

what 're you gon na do with your share of the treasure , pete ?

that 's not the issue , delmar . even if it did put you square with the lord , the state of mississippi is more hardnosed .

preacher said my sins are warshed away , including that piggly wiggly i knocked over in yazoo !

and no transmission belt for two weeks neither .

yeah , let 's negotiate 'em , everett .

now hold on , boys-aintcha ever heard of a negotiation ? maybe we can talk this thing out !

what do we do now , everett ?

how 'd he know about the treasure ?

we ai n't one-at-a-timin ' here , we mass communicatin ' !

vernon waldrip .

cai n't beat 'em , join 'em .

devil his due .

in any state .

well sure , honey , but ...

i counted to three , honey .

i do n't care if it 's ninety thousand .

a 9,000-hectacre lake , honey .

well now honey , that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake .

and you were right about that ring . any other weddin ' band would not do . but this-here was foreordained , honey ; fate was a-smilin ' on me , and ya have to have confidence -

all 's well that ends well , as the poet says .

i ai n't worn it since our divorce came through . it must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin . never thought i 'd need it ; vernon bought one encrusted with jewels .

where 's your ring , honey ?

i can and i am and i will - tomorrow ! i got ta think about the little wharvey gals ! they look to me for answers ! vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet ! the only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train !

i 'll tell you what i am - i 'm the paterfamilias ! you ca n't marry him !

now penny , stop that !

i could n't wait two weeks ! she 's gettin ' married tomorra !

aw , that 's all right .

it 's awful white of ya to take it like that , everett . i feel wretched , spoilin ' yer play for a million dollars ' n point two . it 's been eatin ' at my guts .

quitcha babblin ' pete - time to skedaddle .

itta bena , now , uh , that would be ...

pete , the personal rancor reflected in that remark i do n't intend to dignify with comment , but i would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism . consider the lilies a the goddamn field , or-hell ! - take a look at delmar here as your paradigm a hope .

me ? oh , i did n't have no plan . still do n't , really .

an ' all my meals for free ...

million point two .

that do n't make no sense !

we got but four days to get to that treasure ! after that , it 'll be at the bottom of a lake !

watch your language , young fellow , this is a public market . now , if you want dapper dan i can order it for you , have it in a couple of weeks .

hold on there - i do n't want this pomade , i want dapper dan .

well that all depends . you boys do negro songs ?

well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof ! they 're playin ' it as far away as mobile ! the whole damn state 's goin ' ape !

congratulations , ensign mayo , sir !

get on your feet and find out how good , sir .

yes , sir !

what 're you waiting for , mayo ? get your scuzzy ass up here .

i thought the d.i . 's were supposed to help you in this place ! what kind of human being are you ?

but you do n't understand . there 's this girl he 's gotten pregnant and she 's putting him through hell , sir .

it does n't matter what he 's going through . that 's the whole purpose of this zoo . what matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that ca n't ever happen again .

maybe there 's hope for you yet .

what is it , the kicks ? is that it ?

no , sir !

sell it to the air force , mayo !

sir , that 's not true ! i love my country !

then you 're dumber than i thought ! all you 'll get from their kind is pregnant !

i know i 'm late and i 'm sorry , but mrs. rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and ...

well , i 'll be goddamned .

what ?

oklahoma . i can get my old job back at jc penney 's . in a couple of years , i 'll be floor manager . oh , you 're gon na love oklahoma , lynette . you and mama 'll get along just great . of course , money will be a little tight for a while , but we 'll make it .

no way . i 'm so happy i 'm about to bust . here , honey . this is for you . it cost me my whole savings , but i said what the fuck .

or we could do that yeah .

now what on earth would give you an idea like that ?

i sure remember tommy . mind if we talked about something else ?

is your brother a flyer ?

god help you , lynette !

no . i never feel like that .

what do you mean ?

how did it go with you guys ?

everything was different .

what did he do ? did he do anything that was different ?

come on . let 's go dance .

paula , look at the new poopies .

far fucking out ! i 've been wanting to meet one of the blue angels since i can remember .

of course . i do n't want no okie from muscogee . i can get that right here in port angeles .

because he 's my friend , too .

why ?

i 'd like to come with you .

hey ! you know goddamn well what happened so let 's not play any games , okay ?

your real father was an officer candidate like me ?

for a start , i would n't marry a man i was n't in love with .

no , they 're for your mom .

i 'm sorry . i ca n't sit with you .

does it still hurt ?

my old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while i was at school .

who says i 'm not going after what i want ? my mother 's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory . every time i see her , i know exactly what i do n't want .

i do n't want you to move .

that was great .

what do you want , paula ? what do you really want ?

paula , i never try to fool anybody about who i am , what i want ... so if even in the back of your --

forget it . just get out of here .

where 's that coming from ? i would n't fuck now if my life depended on it !

opening up just a little would n't kill you , ya know .

he did n't give you much choice .

who knows ? guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies .

do you go to school ?

not me .

i hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband .

really ? i 've never been out of washington except once when i visited this aunt of mine over to portland . i mean , over at portland . ai n't it pathetic the way folks talk around here ?

everywhere and nowhere , paula the polack .

the kid on the windy side of the baker 's window . that 's how he put it .

hey , sid , thanks .

i 'll never get it polished in time . give me a buckle , zack .

hey , man , is the piss-ass money you 're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation ?

he said it 's up to us and i got here first , did n't i ?

zack , it was n't him ! he did n't ask me to d.o.r . i came to him on my own . i 'm glad it 's over , zack . i really mean that . he was right . i was n't doing this for me .

i do n't know ... i felt like ... like i was suffocating ... christ , zack ... i was so scared ... so godddamn scared ...

it 's mine .

do you know that for sure ?

but it would still be my kid . that 's the point .

she said it was up to me . if i do n't , she 'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere .

does n't mean shit . get her to a doctor . you ca n't do anything until you hear what he says . make the appointment yourself .

she 's the sweetest person i 've ever known . loves kids . works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church . everybody loves her .

no problem , but who 's susan ?

what ? you 've got ta be kidding !

that is n't true , is it ?

naw .

shhhh ...

'nellie 's nymphos ! '

you know how this is gon na go !

she 's got your gun , that 's what she 's thinking ! the fuck you had to bring a gun for ? !

the walls are steel , right ?

you know how this got ta end .

bullshit .

hurry up , for christ 's sake !

are you okay ?

you got an idea ?

th --

you got till the count of three . then you end up like him .

please ...

yes .

who 's the clown now ? huh ? ! who 's the fucking clown now ? !

fuckin ' asshole , thinks he knows me . drives his german car up to 125th street a couple of times , buys a few rounds , thinks he 's a tough guy , thinks he knows me . you do n't know one thing about me !

make her come out . and when she does , that 's when we got ta be careful . she ca n't get out of this house . she ca n't even think she can get out of this house . we just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes . and i do n't want joe pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger . that 's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in greenhaven . so we 're gon na seal the place up . they wan na hole up in here ? fine , we 'll help 'em . make it impossible for them to leave . once they come out of that room .

what the fuck is funny about this ?

you 're fuckin ' a we can do this .

what ?

we 're not leaving . i 'm getting in that room , and i 'm opening that safe .

close ? are you insane ? we 're nowhere near close ! fuck this , i 'll make an anonymous phone call on monday , they 'll find the floor safe , and i 'll inherit the shit . little piece of it , anyway , it 's better than nothing .

shit !

i did .

she said she did .

where did you get this clown ?

raoul , what in god 's name do we do if she has a gun ?

this is insane . i 'm outta here .

who is this guy ?

exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks ?

fuck !

i know .

fuck .

we 'd like to come in .

what do you want ?

somebody called you ?

yeah ?

evan , i am so sorry , you were a saint to wait for us !

the hell we are .

we 're leaving .

no , you will not , because without burnham there 's no way in hell we 're gon na get into that safe , so as far as i 'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you wo n't lay a finger on him , you understand me ?

i 'm just saying , the man is a problem . and he 's your problem . was n't me idea to bring him along .

he 's right , we ca n't get into the room if they 're dead !

wait a minute , wait a minute . we can still handle this . can we still handle this ?

ever read any poe ?

what ?

none , there 's nothing else , you know how tight the market is .

oh , you know , it 's uh ... it 's in the little fridge in your room .

where is the glucogen ?

what if i do ?

hey , she 's still a smart ass , excellent sign . did you see any sugar in here ? any candy bars , anything sweet ?

why ?

what are you doing ?

if it looks like i ca n't get back , just close the door .

`` titanic . ''

i do n't know , why ?

what am i , a five year old ?

are you freaking out ?

we 're not coming out . we 're not letting you in . get out of my house .

nope .

what do we do ?

what ? ! ? do n't tell me you 're buying this ?

i 'm okay ... listen to me ... let 's go with judge , check it out .

i tell you `` officer '' , it was n't ...

i have confirmed to you my address , that 's all i 'm required to by law to do . we have broken no law .

okay now , er , huey , so what 's your telephone number ?

man , el-rage is el-rage . you know him .

i hear you . alright . i 'll go , you stay .

that 's just it huey . the pigs do n't know how many panthers there are . both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together . we 're not even two hundred strong yet ... but we got 'em guessing thousands .

what the fuck ?

like , you inspector brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore . i think it 's time for a more active type of involvement .

they are carrying guns . they are threatening police officers . they are undermining the united states of america . and you inspector brimmer are not taking your duties seriously ...

yeah ... sounds like the constitution to me . with a little of the bill of rights thrown in ...

yeah ... i 'm fucked up . you 're fucked up . government 's fucked up . whole country 's fucked up . you got no idea what 's going on here . this is bigger than you and me . we 're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole 's desk . the panthers ... fuck you 're history ... they killed you and you do n't even know it .

go ! run ! go on ! get the fuck out of here ! !

inspector brimmer

are you fucking with me ? you smartass piece of shit ...

spontaneous my ass ! ! you told the press and you do n't tell me . remember you 're working for us .

why did n't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol ?

i got you .

yeah .

i do n't know you and i got nothing to say to you .

you know it . stay black ...

god damn ... kid never had a chance ...

motherfucker ... you stay away ...

no fuck you ! ! !

i ai n't gon na tell you no more . no pushing in the neighborhood , especially not on my fucking street . you 're killing your own people asshole .

man ... fuck you . why you always bustin ' my balls ? all that high and mighty militant shit . i ai n't doing nothing .

sabu ... high white dude 's the only thing you could hustle .

c'mon we 'll walk and talk ...

you joining ? my brother.. my brother .

yeah , only i figure you 'd be the one doing the speaking .

... glad you came man .

no man . pe -- `` political education . ''

inside ai n't in the system . it 's right there inside you ! ! i 'm joining up .

yeah , and i 'm gon na start by getting on my feet . working on things from inside the system .

as far as mr. hoover is concerned the worst has happened , the panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in vietnam . by doing so , they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction .

jesus ...

do n't i know it . come on in agent rodgers . sit down . always a ... pleasure to see you . how can i be of help ?

... no full fledge alliance . but i think we should do a rally with them . show that there 's some common ground between black and white . you all with that ? all right then eldridge , set it up .

the time , my friend , is what sartre called , `` the moment the match is being put to the fuse . '' question is , is the hand holding that match gon na be black or white .

and did you witness the shoot-out ?

yes sir i was .

work harder . and get me some results . those black bastards could be up to anything .

alone ...

huey man i got to talk with you ...

where you been ? i saw the cops rousting you at the rally .

c'mon let 's ...

wait a second there brother ...

you got that right . and brother , i got a feeling it 's going to get a whole lot thicker .

you got to keep very cool on this . icy god damn cool . cause baby , you just became the strongest weapon we got . let me guess , he wants you to call him , tell him what we 're doing .

aw ... uh ... it 's was just harassment . my driver 's license expired .

you fit the profile , brother . you look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust ...

you know , you 're lucky to be back . most niggers die on the front lines . seems like that 's what they 're there for .

yeah ... you were a lot of help with those guns . your soldier shit is bad- ass .

i 'm down .

judge ... we 're doing security for betty shabazz 's visit next week . i 'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there . someone like you .

so what 's the deal ?

the pigs are gon na start flooding us with dope . huey wants us to stop them .

what are you saying ?

you better just kill me tyrone . and when huey gets out , when oakland 's just wall to wall junkies , you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got . i 'm sure he 'll be real happy about that .

sorry man ...

yeah , `` brother '' my best friend is stone dead .

nothing .

huh ?

busted firing pin . you want only the legal stuff right ?

what you see is what you got . that 's ' bobby seale .

i thought you said all the panthers were gon na be here .

just a kid .

rose ?

unh ... unh man ... i do n't take no money from friends that need help . fuck no . what do you think i am a bum ?

you meet those friends of yours in jail too ?

it 's okay mom . i 'm allright .

thank you .

it 's alright . i 'm very happy for you .

it 's a start .

uh ... uh ... i ...

what do you mean , old and ugly ?

his victories at charleston and camden were perfect , strategically , tactically , logistically . but he has a weakness .

am i one of that sort ?

trust you and harry lee . remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit fort louis ?

i know him well enough ?

you do n't know him very well , do you ?

he should n't make light . that redcoat should not have been killed .

do you ?

i know that .

i should have known ... once i would have ... i used to be wary ... and today i watched my son killed before my eyes ... your sister civilized me and i damn myself for having let her ...

they 're from good stock on their mother 's side .

first virginia regulars under colonel hamilton .

yes , sir .

as long as your soldiers attack civilians , i will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement . and my men are excellent marksmen .

i beg to differ . one is a command decision on your part . the other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances .

restrain them from the targeting of civilians , including women and children ?

certainly you must know that in civilized warfare , officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention .

shall we proceed ?

as you wish .

probably .

it seems our swamp fox wants to have a formal parley .

yes , sir .

yes .

i 'm not my mother . i ca n't have the respect without the knowing .

that 's not enough . tell me .

you know what happened .

father , tell me what happened at fort wilderness ?

do n't go in there .

where ?

i know .

she said that ? oh , my lord , she said that ?

full sentences . as if she had been speaking all along .

she got me at a more impressionable age .

you learned her lessons better than i .

if you 're here only for revenge , you 're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself .

he tried . it did n't take .

it 's safer if we stay together .

we 'd cover more ground if we split up .

do you intend to enlist without my permission ?

which would force our delegates in philadelphia to vote for independence .

he vowed that if the assembly votes a single shilling to lee , he 'll dissolve the body .

the british army is barricaded in boston . harry lee , is here from virginia , recruiting for a continental army .

what news ?

thank you . how 's the spotted one 's milk ?

i know he did and he 's sorry . he 'll come back as soon as he can .

an american nation . colonel lee , with your permission ?

your son , what did you name him ?

i hope so .

thank you . maybe all of this will buy him some peace .

and congratulations on the birth of your son .

goodbye , harry .

goodbye , francis .

two . gabriel and thomas .

how many men have we seen die ?

how many men does cornwallis have under his command ?

so you 're going to try to keep cornwallis in the south until then .

i 'm sorry .

you said bribery twice ...

that 's a damn long time ...

a long time ago ...

i understood him to be a patriot as well .

we could go stay at aunt charlotte 's farm . she 's to the west .

four , five miles .

yes , he does .

colonel , let us help his soul find it 's place with the almighty and ...

for what ?

thank you .

worse .

remember braddock ?

i 've had no sons to lose , nor daughters . i lose the sons of other men .

i was sorry to hear about your son .

seventeen .

six-pounders . lots of them .

father ?

ayuh .

who is this paxcow ? is he like the boogeyman ?

i want to fly it ! can i fly it now , mommy !

yes , but the rope might be --

do you swear ?

oh , faith 's a little more than just believing .

well , it 's actually reincarnation , but you get the idea . and some people think we just wink out ... like a candle flame when the wind blows hard .

sure , carnation . like in that movie you rented , audrey rose .

but do n't you dare say that .

well , i think michael mcdowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks , my dear .

is he really all right ?

good god ! where 'd you hear that ?

that 's what i think . i heard missy dandridge tell mom when church was fixed he would n't cross the road so much .

i want to look around , daddy -- may i ?

yes .

no -- but if he drops by , i 'll tell him to call you .

i 'm rachel . thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy , here .

-- but i think the thought has crossed your mind .

i 'm thinking about going to bed .

no ... squatting out there at the holiday inn like a couple of vultures . he really thinks rachel 's going to go back with them . her and ellie .

your father-in-law packs a wallop , for an old guy . he and his wife gone back to chicago ?

it 's ellie 's cat .

my father used to have a saying , jud -- `` god sees the truth , but waits . ''

what ?

a little upset is all she was ? because i 'll tell you , jud , my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown .

you and this old indian rag-man --

soil 's thin , all right . but you 'll manage .

i guess so ... but ...

ayuh .

yes . where are we going , jud ?

what do you mean ?

what say , louis ?

yes .

loved that cat pretty well , did n't she ?

for ellie 's birthday , yes . i did n't go because her old man thinks i 'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated ... they 'll be back tomorrow night . jud , what 's this about ?

i like rock and roll . no ... i guess that 's too mild . i love it . since my ears started to die out on me , it 's the only music i can really hear . and since my wife died ... i dunno , some- times a little rock and roll fills up night . not always , but sometimes . one more time -- welcome to ludlow . hope your time here will be a happy one .

the eat a peach album . god , they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them . listen to this , louis .

allman brothers .

god , that 's fine .

movin ' in 's mighty thirsty work . i usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner . come on over and join me , if you want .

you do n't understand --

the door must not be opened . the barrier must not be crossed .

not by me , it is n't . i know how badly i acted , how unfair i was . it 's just that i..you know .

that 's forgotten .

getting there .

oh , you 're welcome . only if some- thing should go wrong while he 's under the gas -- it 's a one-in-a-thousand shot , but it happens -- you explain to her .

i just said --

do n't be silly . church is not going to die .

i think it 's rather extraordinary .

it 's beautiful !

and buckaroo banzai .

louis , the house is beautiful .

anamaria , trim the mainsail !

hah . ten years you carried that pistol , and you end up wasting your shot .

you must swear by the holy bible .

we got that part . anything else ?

elizabeth goes free !

just so you know , jack -- i do n't think you 're that clever . i think you 're a fool . a mortal fool .

no , i really think i do .

you can go to your grave not knowing .

bosun ! set up mr. sparrow 's quarters , nice and fine ... in the brig . meaning no disrespect , of course .

track you down and --

you see , i 've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way , a sort of curse . oh , and there 's the fact that you have no choice .

that 's right .

simple . i have something you wo n't more than anything . the way to free you from the curse of the treasure . you have something i want -- more than anything .

allow me the humor of listening to your terms .

no you wo n't .

turner blood does n't flow pure in his veins . best play it safe , and spill it all .

no reason to fret . it 's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood .

looks like your back to having nothing to offer .

now . no , do n't kill him .

now ?

will -- you ca n't trust him .

the curse drove you to gather this ?

would that i could .

oh , there would be no sense in killing you , miss turner .

maid or not , it fits you .

of course . i did n't steal it , if that 's what you mean .

you 've got sand , for a maid .

there was a lot of long words in there , miss , and we 're not but humble pirates . what is it you want ?

captain barbossa ... i have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against port royal .

my apologies , miss . as you were saying , before you were so rudely interrupted ?

what ?

i am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition i rescue mr. turner ?

one good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness .

elizabeth ? is everything all right ? are you decent ?

and that 's what concerns me . elizabeth , we will be landing in port royal soon , and beginning our new lives . would n't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station ?

you 'll be dining with the captain , and he requests you wear this .

it would appear , so do you .

elizabeth , i think it does n't matter that we are of a different class --

if i had known --

i 'm glad we got here in time .

you did n't tell commodore norrington everything .

you -- you burned up the island , for a one-time chance at being spotted ?

one , because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels . two --

more to drink !

now i must hear this song . an authentic pirate song . have at it .

what ? what was that ? something funny , miss swann ? share , please .

not when you can drink instead , at least .

welcome to the caribbean , love .

it wo n't . it wo n't , and so we wo n't .

me !

first -- have you found me a crew ?

well , fortunately , i know how to counter it . the man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink , and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition .

what ? he never told me that .

i 'll tell lee . now , jack sparrow has an honest streak in him , and that 's where the whole problem starts . this was when he was captain of the black pearl --

i know . that was for the smell .

the wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we 're underway , we 'll never catch them .

some sort of to-do up at the fort , eh ? you two were n't invited ?

nothing i would n't be please to be rid of .

by remembering that i serve others , not only myself .

the worst . on the other hand , maybe i 'm a man who ca n't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice ! -- and who knows how to get what he wants . now that 's a great pirate .

are you certain this is the right way ?

do n't talk . these caves magnify sound . just follow me .

jack !

my name is will turner , the son of bootstrap bill turner . his blood runs in my veins . you need my blood . and on my word i will pull this trigger , and sink all the way down to davy jones ' locker !

go to the opposite end of the island , and signal the ship . i 'll keep 'em busy .

i 'll lead them away .

what 's that ?

wait -- what about the pistol ?

shut up , before you lose them all !

oh -- did i forget to mention that ?

tortuga ?

put it away , will . it 's not worth getting beat again .

i have n't set foot off dry land since i was twelve , when the ship i was on exploded . it 's been a sound policy .

how ? the key 's run off .

never . they took miss swann .

and you want to turn pirate yourself ?

are you familiar with that ship ? the black pearl ?

he may be .

he 's not telling the truth .

and no lies !

like i said , there 's no real ship as can match -- hey !

oh , and no ship that 's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore could n't possibly be any ship other than the black pearl . is that what you 're saying ?

yes , i have .

yes .

you 've seen it ?

no , it 's not .

please .

has my daughter given you an answer yet ?

dr. argon , everything 's starting to come apart here . you hired me to take care of these matters of security and i am trying , but elements are making my job impossible .

look , i do n't mean to rain on everyone 's ascension here , but we got a little problem .

mr. sim , when you do locate him . do not scare him off again . just watch him . i think you can handle that . right , mr. sim ?

until he 's done .

a light mixture of oxygen , dioxide , and sodium pentothal . he 'll sleep , that 's all .

susan , i sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in . i ask that you keep in mind that i am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what i want .

how do you know we 're not heading in the wrong direction ?

i brought you up here , dr. bright , because i want you to understand that we are on the path . the only difference is that you are walking with your head down , afraid to look up , to see where the path is going .

does that mean oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb ?

we will always love most that which we create . do n't you agree , susan ?

you ca n't mean that .

if you think i would ever give you the nanobot after this , you are deluding yourself .

wheelchair accessible .

yeah , i 'm going to finish what you started --

please , o'brien , do n't do this to me ! i 'll give you anything you want !

you mean besides kicking your ass ? !

it remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy . history is written by the victor .

if you 'd like , we can go straight to the authorities . i understand they are very interested in talking to you .

if you loved me like i loved you ?

what i asked you earlier ?

it will be an ascension .

can you feel it , poppy ? the presence of the moment ? can you feel the weight of its significance ?

consideration ?

poppy , please , just tell me what you want .

you know how i feel about you . you know how much i need you . how much i trust you . i would do anything for you .

do you think she loves him ?

oh no . no . we 'll get her assistant . what's-his-name ? nebbishman ?

now , icky , i do n't need you winding yourself up . i need you focused and in control .

icky ! what 's happening ?

she says it 's not .

in the meantime , why do n't you find something useful for dr. bright to do .

dr. makeo is working on it now , sir . i estimate at least another six hours .

the trunk .

the fact is , that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up .

i like trix !

yeah , i do !

oh no , no , no . no can do . you enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and i do n't care if it 's a styrofoam cup or the exxon valdez ! you 've got to learn to take responsibility !

what is it with you litterbugs ? is it a territorial thing , marking your turf with your garbage ?

why do n't you just shove it up your ass ! haw-haw !

why do n't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs .

haw-haw ! why do n't you run off and find a cop and i 'll wait right here .

who is n't ?

because i am a new man , susan . i am a man of vision . your problem , susan , is that you 're always looking down . if you 'd just look up you 'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost . they focus on what can be gained .

there 's a guard outside my door ! i 'm a prisoner , nigel ! do you understand that ?

you were never invited to my house .

what i 've always done . as long as i 'm the only one who can build the nanobot , i 'm the only one who can say when it should be tested .

i bet he has n't read a single report we 've written on the waste problem .

this day just keeps going from bad to worse .

that 's the guy ?

yeah . but it was n't a group . it was one man .

oh yeah . they were working on molecular assemblers , too , were n't they ?

do you remember about five years ago , that uh ... incident at purnell labs ?

what did he want ?

aaabout ... ?

susan !

yes . that 's it . he 's got it . oh god , he 's got it !

you mean he 's polymerized , like me ?

oh shit , the meltdown . it 's spread to the tower .

did you think i could just leave you ... ?

i do n't believe it . you 're here ! oh thank god .

that 's going to fit me ?

no cheese .

what did you want my hair for ?

i do n't know .

the nanobot ... it 's not here ...

daniel , i did n't hear you come down ...

i 'm glad you came to me for help .

yeah . old times .

is something wrong ?

no , why ?

the nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid , so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a good year tire than a human being .

if you do n't want to do it this way , i can remove it surgically .

the nanobot is still inside you . it 's programmed to exit through the urinary tract . we need it as soon as possible , so swallow those .

we do n't ?

it escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment .

... just like the mouse .

they did it to me !

daniel , what are you doing here ?

i ca n't help it , suze . it 's this place . you know how i get in these stores . they freak me out . all these tiny boxes , little cans filled with eight syllable god knows what .

i 'm sorry i brought the whole thing up ! if you 're gon na flip your wig --

we 've had this conversation already , daniel .

and what i love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think . it unifies the entire world on a single level . everything is completely connected . sometimes i can really feel it , everything around us , just a small part of a whole . it 's really wonderful .

it was a long time ago , daniel . we were young , different people , heading in different directions . that 's all .

do you ever wonder what happened to us , susie ?

i 've read they 're using it to repair cancer cells .

it already is .

i guess i should be flattered .

i 've been thinking about you a lot all these years , locked up in my cell . i 'd tear through every issue of the midwest science journal looking for your latest findings , watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies , the fruit fly . exciting stuff . i got to tell you , it really kept me going .

oh yeah . see , susie , a man does n't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off . oh no . the big house does things to a man .

i 'm real touched . now get your sunday 's on . we 're going for a ride .

mr. sim ? do you have him ? he 's alive ?

okay , barbie , let 's get this over with .

is that a threat , dr. bright ?

'paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured . '

yes - sing sing .

you 've done nothing but watch me - watch me ! - ever since i 've been here . treated me like a thug , watched me like a hawk , mistrusted me . every time i leave the house , that jane goes out and counts the silverware .

this is something i should have done a long time ago , only i did n't have sense enough to do it . no , i had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that i knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning . but no more . no more ! so that 's that .

now wait , do n't get excited , anne . there 's no reason for that . perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink . that 's all right . i 'm sorry . i 'll go right down and throw them out . that 's no reason for you to take this attitude . after all , i certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house , have n't i ?

now wait a minute . are n't you being a little unreasonable ?

oh hello , anne he types furiously .

that 's exactly what you mean . heaven knows you 've made that clear to me often enough . well , i 'm sick and tired of it . i 've given you party after party - i 've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful ? no ! you insult them and act like a bore . i 'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you 've done . perhaps it 's just as well you 're not coming tonight . maybe i can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you , and what you 're going to do .

meaning , my friends are n't worthwhile , i suppose ?

but i do n't want to meet your gang .

i 'll tell you what let 's do - i 'll take you and introduce you to all my gang . would you like that ?

what am i going downstairs and tell those people ?

i 'm talking about - i 'm not going out .

you did ? that 's a lot of hooey ! i 'll go and apologize .

that was kind of a rotten thing to do , anne . after all , gallagher is my friend . the least you can do is be courteous to her .

yes - is n't it ?

did n't i ? that 's funny . is n't it funny ?

gallagher ?

honey , i love you . i 'll eat spinach for you . i 'll go to the dentist twice a year for you . i 'll wash behind my ears for you . but i will never wear garters !

besides i 'd look foolish . i could n't look gallagher in the face .

you wear them of course , silly .

do you like them ?

listen stew baby , let 's not talk about things like that now

why should i ? we 're happy , are n't we , darling ?

how-di-do .

please go . i 'll explain to mother .

i 'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you .

you do n't wear garters !

really ?

your mother will want to kiss me ? give me back my letters . that 's the breaks i get . it 's the mothers that are always grateful to me . here .

i 'm not interested . smythe will open the door .

just a moment . i do n't see how that trash could possibly concern me .

i 'm not interested in your literary recommendations .

you may go , smythe .

i 'm sure you 're quite willing to be decent about this .

why does n't dexter show some decency ? and you might show some too , mother . what do you expect a man to do when he 's called such names ? i 'm glad you hit that reporter , stewart . he deserved it .

look ! look ! the front page !

stop it . anne . you 're behaving like the person you 're married to .

oh , the usual thing . blah , blah , blah attended the blah , blah reception and wore the same blah , blah things .

i was so worried for fear he 'd knock over a vase or something . i must have acted like an idiot . what does it say about the reception last night ?

good morning , mother . did n't i tell you that he 'd be marvelous . everybody thought he was so charming last night .

why

oh , hello mother !

splendid , mother . let 's hop over to monte carlo . it 's a great place to save a face .

oh , a party ! great , great ! jolly times and merry pranks . that 's me . i 'm a guy who loves parties . you know

who is it you wish to see , sir ?

give my regards to your managing editor .

all right , all right , do n't mention it .

i know , i know . but there 's no truth in the story whatsoever .

yeah !

is that so ?

fine . have a seat .

yeah , hello . how are you ?

well , stew , that 's all thrashed out . by golly , i 'm surely glad to see that you 're not really sore . you know our racket - after all , news is news .

it 's all right . you can write your own ticket . a hundred and fifty bucks a week .

is that so ? well , have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph ?

hey , make up your mind , will you ?

no ?

i 'm not quitting !

araby ?

the one about the siberian bloodhound ?

that 's so .

now get this , conroy . my name is smith . always was smith - and always gon na be smith .

well , when are you quitting ?

baloney ! joe ! bring me a special !

well , you see , i 've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws , and we were afraid she would n't understand the whole idea . so we were going to wait till she went to europe .

no , no - it 's true , all right , only we did n't want to get it in print yet , that 's all .

not on my own beat , no .

it has been alleged - yes

yeah ?

look , i quit !

yes sir !

that 's a canary ! who brought that in here ? canary , huh ? go on , get that out of here . get that out of here !

are you trying to tell me that i need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up ?

say , you are nice . you 're all right . you 'd make a good wife .

yes . i must have been pretty much plastered if i hired a valet .

dawson , huh ? was i very drunk last night ?

dawson , sir .

you newspaper people have a lot of fun with him , do n't you ? what is it you call him - the cinderella man ?

he 's probably very tired . you see , he 's had to meet all these people personally tonight .

that 's a lovely dress .

but that 's ridiculous ! you ca n't make a sudden change like that .

how about my breakfast ? how do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach ?

nope - afraid i 'm all out of tricks tonight .

now gallagher , if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay . could n't dig one out of your hat some place , could you ?

and there 's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he 'd make a great villain - and there 's you !

did n't he go to sea before he wrote about it ?

i do n't know a thing about him , but is n't he the one you 're always yelling about ?

did who ?

well , i 've just been able to get off that norway coast - so far .

how far have you gotten ?

yes - and i 'd love it .

okay .

yes .

no , no . strange , i 've never seen anne act that way before . it 's funny i never thought to tell her you were a girl , is n't it ?

must be my wife .

my mistake - she 's glaring .

pay attention ? i 'm not paying any attention to him . you think that guy could get me upset ? hah ! not that mug . he 's a tough mug - hard , cynical . he does n't know the fine things in life - that guy . a bird in a gilded cage , huh ? it 's getting so a guy ca n't step out without being called a magnolia . stew smith , a magnolia ! not me . say , i 'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life ! i 'll tell you that . not me , not me . i 'm going to step out and mean something in this world . you watch me . say , am i a lucky guy to be near anne schuyler ? i 've been hit with a carload of horseshoes , and believe me i know it . lucky , i 'll say i 'm lucky ! do n't you think i 'm lucky , gallagher ?

cut that out . just because i 'm married - there 's no reason for that .

now get this , gallagher - smith . that 's the name .

remember , she 's a schuyler .

who - anne ? sure , anne would love that .

do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates ?

sure . i wish you all the luck in the world , pal .

well , well , well ! gallagher , old pal ! there you are . what did you run away for ?

well , you 're my pal , are n't you ? then do n't turn female on me .

and that

you what ?

i hope not . . . i 've got to call on her this morning !

unconscious . you know , when you do n't know anything . your natural state . there are some people - you ca n't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well , i happen to be one of those guys .

listen grayson , i 've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank . now anne can have any part of that she wants , but she 'd better hurry because i 'm spending it awfully fast .

you do n't .

surely , sit down . if i had known you were coming , i would have thrown you up a waffle .

surely , come right in .

certainly ! i 'll take care of this guy bingy myself , personally . now what are you crying about ?

i have it here .

a statement ? good .

we admit nothing . however , i have a little statement all prepared .

sure .

what 's going on here ? who is this woman ?

anne schuyler , are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us ? have n't you any decency left ?

all right , grandma

stop calling me mother !

oh , my marriage to anne . now mrs. schuyler , we do n't want you to go to any trouble about that . we just want the usual blessings , that 's all .

nobody seems to want to do anything why not ask me ? perhaps i can offer a suggestion . do what about what ?

with pleasure , madame !

that 's all i wanted to know !

yes .

smythe ! i mean - when you 're alone and want to amuse yourself , then what ?

well , sir , i putter .

yes , sir .

me , sir ?

smythe , come here . i want to talk to you . come on , smythe , talk to me . smythe , i 'm going nuts . i 'm going nuts in this house ! this big . . . come on , i 'm not going to hurt you . come on , what 's the matter with you ?

did you call , sir ?

that 's what i think of it , bingy !

smythe ! well , well , well ! with a y , huh ? congratulations ! what a small world . brothers under livery . shake ! now , as a smith to a smythe

now , now jeeves . [ 5 ] was that nice ? was that being a gentleman , jeeves ? was it , jeeves ? your name is jeeves , is n't it ?

... sex .

no . i want to know .

it does n't matter .

yeah ... that -- and ...

i made you these for the trip . they 're marshmallow rice squares .

thank you .

no ... they wo n't be able to tell .

why no . she 's still on her date with biff ... is something the matter ?

bud . mary sue ... breakfast is on the table .

yeah . or like sprinklers in the summer ...

sounds nice ... once you get used to it .

but you ca n't go out there .

i do n't know .

what is that ?

wait ...

no she 's not .

she 's crying .

is n't it great how she 's resting like that ?

here 's my favorite .

bud ?

well ... here 's what it 's s'posed to look like .

having kind of a tough time .

thanks .

no , no ... come on in .

i 'm sorry ...

hello bill .

i do n't want it to go away .

it goes away ... it 'll go away .

it 's fine . you 'll put on some make up and ...

look at me george . that meeting 's not for me . look at my face .

but your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about .

oh darling that 's wonderful ! i always knew you could do it .

i said , no ! ... i 've read like one book in my whole life and i 'll be damned if i let you throw it on that fire ...

i 'm busy .

what are you doing ?

to be honest mary sue . i did n't think you 'd want to come here until we 'd been pinned for a little while .

now do n't you think she looks just as pretty in color ? do n't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her ?

real rain ?

are you alright ? what is it ?

oh sure ... you bet . betty ...

i 'm sure you 've noticed the same things we all have -- certain `` changes '' going on in the town . you know what i mean by `` changes '' ?

betty 's making some pineapple kabobs ...

why am i out of order ?

i 'm not lying ... here i 'll show you .

the basketball team ?

it 's like the basketball team .

we prefer to keep these proceedings as `` pleasant '' as possible . i do n't think a lawyer will be necessary .

um ... i do n't know how to do that , bob .

um ... outside of pleasantville .

how 'd you know about the fire ?

yes .

mr. simpson ...

you got the admissions letter .

besides . you think there 's like a chance i 'm gon na get into college back there ?

i 'm not ready yet . i got ta do this for a little while .

this thing works . we could go home right now .

i told you . i 'm like positive .

seemed kinda sexy . look . i read 35 pages .

... yeah .

d.h. lawrence . you ever heard of him ?

they do n't have that kind of potential .

you have no right to do this .

what did you do to him ?

just go with the program -- hunh ? i 'm late for work .

can we do any better ?

those are my friends .

hunh .

does he -- you know -- like `` me '' ?

to who ?

owns the hardware store .

we 're supposed to be at home david ! we 're supposed to be in color ! oh god ...

we 're supposed to be in school .

what did you do ?

i 'm not sure .

no way .

lem me see that .

omigod , i do n't be-lieeeeve this ! he 's gon na like beeeee here !

yeah . every episode ever .

pleasantville marathon ?

you 're gon na forget about me .

i 'm not sure .

it was a prop for the school play ...

it 's beautiful . where 'd you get it ?

they just grow like that ?

well it 's big . and it 's blue ... ... it 's really really blue .

out there .

do they have those ... where you come from ?

um ... you got ta turn off main street .

keeps going ...

oh , no ... you baked those for whitey .

of course it is howard . that 's why they call it a marathon .

much less than that . an hour and a half .

they were n't my memories . i borrowed them . it 's no good when you borrow them .

i do n't know what went wrong . you answered every question . you knew every detail . the senior prom ... mcintire 's department store . we had all the same warm memories : sock hops . the church social ...

so ... i guess as long as i 'm here , all sorts of things could happen to this place . we could have pink lawns and blue trees ...

oh . you 're a smart little bastard are n't you ? it 's kind of like a restricted ticket . you got ta leave the same way you came .

i 'm sorry ... i ca n't let you do that .

excuse me ?

it was a gift bud . it was so special . you liked these things as much as i did , remember : warm smells in the family kitchen ? a smile from a stranger ? you know how rare that is ?

i want a word with you ...

wait a minute ! !

weil would n't you ! you look for someone for years ... you pour your heart into it ... this is a privilege you know . i do n't think i better talk about this right now .

look -- we appreciate it . we really do . we just -- we want to go home now .

why would i do that ?

what the hell 's going on !

oh -- could n't charge you for something like that . it 's free .

sure . big beautiful set like this -- you want something that 'll put you right in the show .

yeah ...

... her father .

it 's beautiful .

no , that 's not it .

oh my gosh , bud ...

are n't you a little early ?

hi .

oh , hi .

christmastime .

so they can have their hamburgers !

oh ... okay . ... but i really liked it .

forget about that !

oh -- what 's the point , bud ?

two cheeseburgers , two cherry cokes .

bud ...

i understand .

sorry ... i had to help my folks and then i could n't find my hat ...

dream come true , hunh ?

remember the one where bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him ?

well it 's just not true . we would n't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit ? did you say hello to your brother in law 's ?

`` chat ? '' did you just say `` chat ? ''

hey it 's me , what are you doing ?

this is barry .

what city ?

... yes i 'm still on hold ...

there is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you 're killing me , you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --

do you know where she 's staying in hawaii ?

what about her ? you did n't ask her out , you 're such a pussy --

why 's it here ?

oh my god . look at that .

yeah i ca n't .

you 're being weird again , see . come on . please do n't be weird .

i 'm not gon na rag you . why would i do this just to rag you ?

you do n't do anything , why are you being scared ?

it 's fine , but --

seriously , though : we 're going to eat , i said .

i have work , i ca n't leave .

hey , what are you doing ? why are you wearing a suit again ?

-- but since you 're not going i guess none of this matters and i 'll bring her anyway .

well , yeah , thank you , but --

yeah , no , it 's not , it 's just --

... please , i just do n't want it ... .

please do n't .

yeah but please do n't do that : everyone would be looking at me .

no i 'm sorry , now i have to get off the phone ... .

i have to go .

no you wo n't .

this is ... .illegal ... .i 'll call the police .

why did you tell me you did , then ?

i know i did . but i do n't .

i do n't have a girlfriend --

i thought you had your own business . you said you were gon na diversify and all that stuff ... .

yes , no , yes . i ca n't . i ca n't afford that . i 'm sorry . sorry .

you do n't even know how much it is .

me ?

it 's ok that i 'm calling , right , i mean ? it 's ok .

well why do n't you take your pants off and stroke it for me ?

sometimes when i 'm lonely .

you have a girlfriend ?

no .

yeah ? so what are you doing , then ?

i 'm in my bedroom .

no .

yes .

hi , is this jack ?

lena i 'm so sorry . i 'm so sorry that i left you at the hospital ... .. i called a phone sex line . i called a phone sex line before i met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and i 'm sorry -- and i had to leave because i do n't want you to get hurt again and now i 'm here and i 'm back and i have a lot of pudding that i can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time i can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because i do n't want to be anywhere without you ... ..can you please let me redeem the mileage ?

i forgot about that .

for what ?

iiiiiiiiiii do n't want to hurt anything ever , but what i 'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it 's just the cutest , softest , most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wan na do is squeeze it . just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it . to take a little puppy and smash its skull ... just so precious , so beautiful . just so god damn wonderful and cute you wan na smack it and kick it and love it . fuck . i do n't know . i do n't know . and you , you ... ..i 'm looking at you and i just ... .your face is so beautiful i just wan na smash it , just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it ... you 're so pretty .

oh my god , you are so adorable . i just ... .god dammit .

do you wan na have sex ?

ok. so you were married for how long ?

hi . where are you ? are you here ?

have a good trip .

i do n't , no matter what my sisters say , ok ?

what do you mean ?

that was good .

hi .

if you come to hawaii --

what ?

what happened ?

your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you , when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window ? is that right ? you threw a hammer through a sliding glass door ?

my friend carlos is doing it who works with me . it 's his . it 's his pudding , he 's doing it . it 's not mine . he 's crazy . i told him not to do it . he 's the one who 's insane . he only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --

that 's insane . that is really , really crazy . that 's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding .

yeah .

you were talking about the promotion --

... i thought i should tell you . i did n't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --

... .hi ... ..

... .hi ... ..

you came all the way from los angeles to tell me that ?

i 'm a nice and reasonable man . i did n't do anything wrong . please do n't make me hurt you . and i 'm telling you : that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that i love ... ..i will hurt you many , many , many times over ... ..because it 's not right to take people 's trust .

no . no . do n't you say that .

who is this ?

how many sisters do you have ?

i think you have a call ?

yes ... ..we do ask for ... .30 to 60 days ... .

i know that . maybe you know other doctors ?

yeah .

how you doin ' barry ?

no , no , no , no , no , no , no !

how am i supposed to know what to do if you do n't say it -- if it 's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am i supposed to know how to be with this --

no , no , no , no , no . what do you mean ? it does n't state anywhere about six to eight weeks .

where you been ?

you know you can get places in the world with pudding . that 's funny .

wow , you 're goin ' to hawaii , that 's great -- you 're goin -- ?

where you goin ?

i have to talk to you in a second about that , lance , ok ?

you talkin ' to me about ramada inn ?

let 's just leave it there for now .

you 're goin ' on a trip ?

why is it here ? barry ... .barry ?

... .yes ... ..

ok. this is what you get when you 're a pervert -- you said you 'd help someone out and you did n't so we 're just getting some money for her and that 's that .

alright , alright .

no .

you have an atm ?

it 's three hundred and twenty dollars , just take it .

hi .

i know .

ok .

seriously .

i wo n't .

seven o'clock .

right now , you 're doing nothing ?

nothing .

are you going to the party tonight ?

hi , kathleen , i 'm just working .

this is this place called ace vintage , you got ta find it , i do n't know exactly where this is and i do n't understand these maps so just go there and check it out . it 's a '61 ac cobra that this old guy says is fine , but i need to figure out why he 's only asking 23 for it . so take a look , the whole thing , call me about that , if it seems alright then i 'll head down there and check it out .

david , do n't . just . seriously . it does n't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense . ok ? it 's business . seriously . one hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house . i 'm serious now . ok. please . now . just stop .

i want you to go right away , i think that 's best . i also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling .

i 'll just see you when you get back here .

it 's fine .

ok. what should i do about eric ?

ok .

bye , barry .

you ready ?

yeah , no , i have to get something from my car , i said .

he 's being weird , i 'm sorry . i have no idea why he 's being weird and dressed in a suit --

it 's ok. that 's alright .

he 's wearing a suit again , i do n't know why he 's wearing a suit , he does n't usually dress like that --

ever since his unfortunate death , there 's been a surge of interest in his work . i 'll use the profits to restore charenton to her former glory .

-- and the listless ones do the binding .

i hear he 's got a whetstone and chisel , and he uses them to sharpen his teeth .

no one 's forcing you to listen .

marquis ? is that you ?

do n't come any closer , abbe . god 's watching .

do n't come back , not tonight , not again --

what ? what 've i done ?

they incite us to act . in ways we should not ... can not ... a lesson the marquis would do well to learn .

if i was n't such a bad woman on the page , abbe , i 'll hazard i could n't be such a good woman in life .

why not act the role of heroines instead ? queen esther from the bible , or st. joan ?

but why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence ?

ow !

i was wrong to free him , but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --

we ca n't . all we can do is guard against our own corruption .

i must grant him his last rites .

i dare you . stab my flesh . which one of us will bleed ?

we inspected the body , marquis . she died a virgin .

why was it you never took her by force ?

it 's not your province to ask .

and did you ?

i wanted to fuck her , that 's all !

i saw the longing in your eye --

an innocent child is dead .

for fuck 's sake , abbe ! what am i to do ? police my readers as you police me ? suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned ? would you condemn the bible ? i think not !

it 's a potent aphrodisiac , is n't it ? power over another man .

what on earth would that require ?

i could be convinced to abandon my writing , quite voluntarily .

-- water ! --

virgin birth -- ha ! an entire religion , built on an oxymoron !

his rug .

then bugger me !

madeleine . she 's besotted with me ; she 'd do anything i ask . she could pay you a midnight visit --

you always do .

you mean to take us all down with you ?

honestly ! you cut me to the core ! what 's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when i finally succumb -- when at long last , i pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion ? have you no faith in your own medicine ?

you 've a touch of the poet , too ; perhaps you should take up the quill .

you among them ?

i write of the great , eternal truths that bind together all mankind ! the whole world over , we eat , we shit , we fuck , we kill and we die .

but you 've no right to publish ! behind my back , without my sanction !

what did you do ? bribe one of the guards ?

i 'll fill page after page , i promise .

we treat you well enough here , do n't we marquis ? your very own featherbed , in lieu of a straw mat . your antique writing desk , all the way from lacoste . enough quills to feather an ostrich --

and you ? it must 've been an ordeal .

my , my . you have exceeded my expectations .

i beg you , doctor , do n't make me say it .

you 'd suffer in her stead ?

-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers . charenton is a sanatorium ; she is not a circus . the theater is henceforth closed . as for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --

you ought to be ashamed , abbe . exploiting those drooling , pathetic cretins for financial gain --

oh indeed ?

you keep strange company , abbe . but if you truly have matters in hand here --

he 's more than a patient , doctor ; the marquis is my friend --

and -- ?

a practical man , sir . given the marquis ' unusual tastes , a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent .

have you tried bleeding him with leeches ? the calming chair ? maybe you should flog him at the stake ?

unless we set charenton on a straight and narrow course , she 'll be shut down forever by order of the emperor .

yes ?

you have to believe me , i had no idea --

it 's essential to his recovery ; a purgative for the toxins in his mind .

besides , every wholesome thing he might desire , he has at charenton . a library , filled with the world 's great books , music lessons , watercolor exercises --

and he 's never once attempted escape ?

better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one .

his wife 's ?

he 's made a great success of our little theater ; there 's seldom an empty seat . not to mention its therapeutic value .

i hope you 'll judge him by his progress here , and not his past reputation .

this may feel a tad awkward , my friend , but it need n't be . i 've merely come to oversee your work here ; understood ?

but i am history .

charenton ? the administrator there is quite well-loved , is he not ?

i do n't seek popularity or renown , monsieur delben . mine is a higher mission .

i tremble with fear ! you 're bound to pound the quivering lips of my venus mound !

at last she arrives , my hard-won bride ! hurry , my child , and scurry inside . there you 'll find such treasures await you ; marzipan and meringue to sate you !

come now , darling , give it a read .

a tale more horrible than all the rest combined !

yes ! you shall . of course you shall --

-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet ! there , armed with a quill of my own , i 'll commit it to paper !

go on , child .

my newest book begins at my right cuff , continues across my back , and completes itself at the base of my left shoe ...

what have they done to you now ?

it 's a long story , this one .

the price , my coquette , is every bit as firm as i am ...

a kiss for each page .

most assuredly .

is it awfully violent ?

the unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass , the darling of the lower wards , where they entomb the criminally insane .

the peril of composing such incendiary prose ...

i suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours .

you ? frighten me ? that 's a good one ! i 'm twice as fast as you are . who 'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind ?

i assume you 've come to plead for clemency on your husband 's behalf .

i beg to differ , doctor . you work in a madhouse . your every waking moment is governed by the insane .

it 's a convenience , is n't it , having your husband locked away ! you no longer have to hold your tongue , or hoist your skirts ! or crack your mouth , so i can put it to its one pleasurable use ! you 're not my wife , no ! you 're one among my many jailers , are n't you ?

they 've put you up to this , have n't they ?

you 've come to lecture me ?

she knew what she was signing on for after all , she took the money .

do n't insult me with your cute press quotes save it for louella .

last week would this be ?

ever met walter winchell ?

when i met him i was just 20. and he was 55. i saw the gold ring and just grabbed on . and he was going to make me a star .

listen , you come down and stay with us for a few days . just tell the old man that --

mm .

you need to get outta here , rapunzel

i 'll remember that .

and director .

who are you , sir ?

mm . not a very good picture i am told .

that 's right . you 've captured me exactly . goodnight .

did you need it ? did you need any of it ?

it 's 12th century . from deauville -- in france .

we are in no `` pickle '' -- as you would euphemistically have it .

i 'm not asking you to defend anything . but we 're in a pickle and we got ta talk about it .

i will not defend my life to you --

bought and p-p-paid for . just like one of his goddamn statues . well at least in the movie he married her !

it 's not really --

nothing for you to worry about , darling

you oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president , after all .

the journal was pretty harsh to roosevelt today .

you 're not going to get another chance , boy ! look right at the monster and you tell him --

this is the chance you 've been waiting for , boy . tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him !

oh for god 's sake , louella-

i wan na see the picture today

no -- no -- i mean --

schaefer , i got ta see this welles picture

george ...

mank !

this ai n't george 's doing -- !

you stupid , little man ! how could you have let this happen ? ! i gave you my soul and now you 're going to sell it ! ?

kinda .

they wo n't let it out . not hearst . not the other studio heads --

it 's too late . the movie 's made

hedy lamarr ?

no , you got ta hear this-

mank , sit down . you missed the opening of the new picture but i 'll go back --

i want you back

k-a-n-e. one strong syllable . kane i

the title ?

good ? ! good ? ! words fail you at last ! it 's terrific ! now i 'll have to do some shaping , of course , and some of the scenes are n't exactly . . . exactly . . .

it 's good , huh ?

how ?

he 'll destroy us .

and yeah , sure , hearst 's a great subject . been keeping notes on him for years for my ... great american novel . but i ca n't do it anymore . no studio 's gon na hire me and i - -

when i was a kid i wanted to scorch the world too - - i had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories . but all that 's finished for me --

-- because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself . amusing his keepers . because he is a sycophant ! because he has been thrown out of every studio in hollywood and no one will hire him because he 's a drunk- - !

i remember a man who wrote i he was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight --

fuck you

yes .

oh for christ 's sake-

okay , boy wonder , what ?

mank ! you scoundrel ! what took you so long ? !

the whole joint is half the size of rhode island .

no , baby , those are the hands of a killer

he 's nothing but a hypocrite . he preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress .

you 're a laugh-riot , kid .

magic

nope .

so ai n't this just the bee 's knees ? the high muckey-mucks dolled up all aztec-like for the human sacrifice .

monstro ! ran into walter winchell outside he wants to play herod in the picture . hiya , george .

i been talking to swanbeck in new york and ... orson , i think they 're gon na take it a long pause as welles looks at schaefer

thank you -- b-b-but i 'd really like t-t-to --

excuse me , i hope this is n't rude , but are n't you marion davies ?

you talked to new york ?

to do what ?

very generous

`` rosebud ? i 'll tell you about rosebud

again .

so , on to the life of christ !

oh god . . .

happy birthday .

i do n't want to sit

you 're not still mad at me , i hope

this isn ' t some kinda fucking game ! you know how many people rko employs ? ! you know how many people depend on what we do for a living ? !

`` your movie '' -- i am so sick of that ! it 's your movie -- but it 's his life ! did you ever think about that ? ! did you ever think about that old man and marion having to watch as you tore them apart ? !

for christ 's sake , shut up --

`` do what you can '' ? ! that 's not good enough i

and this is the evening edition . notice anything ?

i know , i know ! but what more can you expect of me ? ! i have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to -- !

citizen kane there 's your title .

pardon ?

yes ! vibrant and modern and stark like a picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning i we shoot the whole thing in the gallant american west --

you want to do the life of jesus ?

oh , no --

we done ?

no , we 're all right . thanks anyway , tommy .

how can he embarrass you ?

aw , tommy , c'mon , it ai n't that .

all right , you guys , shake hands .

i 'm gon na kill him . that fuckin ' jig 's gon na wish he never came outa the jungle . you got any money ?

now the fight 's off the books altogether . meyer lansky could n't get a bet down on this fight . some people are saying you 're going into the tank .

here 's your carrots . you 're in such a hurry . you ca n't wait .

do you think i 'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin ' around ?

yeah , i really cleaned up on him .

so what ?

i did keep an eye ...

did n't it have nothin ' to do with me ?

it did n't have nothin ' to do with you .

nothin ' . salvy was out of line . he was drunk or somethin ' , i dunno . anyway , the windup was i gave him a beatin ' . tommy called me down , and we straightened it out . it 's all forgotten about .

i ca n't tell . you 're stomach 's in the way .

well , that 's what i mean .

except fall down like a normal person .

g'wan , do it . protect yourself , rummy .

when i 'm away , did you ever notice anythin ' funny with her ? tell me the truth .

try talkin ' to her . she 's your wife -- ask her what 's the matter .

i remember the first time i met vickie ... i know there 's somethin ' up . i know she 's doin ' somethin ' , but i ca n't catch her ...

whatcha doin ' ?

this janiro 's an up-and-coming fighter , this kid you got ta knock out . knockout this fuckin ' kid ! i 'm telling you , this is your step towards getting a shot at the title . listen to me : i 'm telling you . you been killin ' yourself for three years . there 's nobody left -- they 're afraid to fight you . this janiro 's up-and- coming . he do n't know . fuckin ' tear him apart , wipe him out ! what are you worried about ? your weight ? look , even if you lose they 're gon na think you 're weak ; they 're gon na think you 're not the fighter you used to be . they 'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before , and then you 'll kill them and you 'll get your title shot . and if you beat this kid janiro , they got ta give you a shot at the title because there 's nobody else . either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it . all right ?

i just weighed myself -- i 'm 161. no more deals like this janiro bullshit . i did n't tell you to do it in the first place .

you want us to wait for you ?

i 'm the only guy ever to beat sugar ray , and i still do n't have a shot at the title .

with her ? how ?

nah , she do n't go with nobody . she 's only 15 years old .

i 'm tellin ' you , she 'll be there , i know she 'll be there .

hey , i do n't care about tommy como . i do n't care about jesus christ on the fuckin ' cross . i got ta give them a percentage of what i make ! i 'm in here breaking my ass , not them . do n't ever bring them up here again .

yeah , yeah . they just wanted to talk to you . so i ...

harder . take the towel off .

you heard me , i said hit me .

sure . what is it ?

that 's what i 'm sayin ' . you should n't even think like that . it 's crazy .

hey , c'mon , what 's the matter ?

ai n't she beautiful ? coulda been mrs. america if i did n't pull her outa the contest . did n't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me .

you guys know more about that than i do . i just fight ...

do n't talk . keep at it . jab , jab , jab . you 're ahead on points .

i 'll give you anything you want , jake . i think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break .

ca n't you get the money from your friends ?

but they do n't have a case against you .

all right , just do n't make any noise .

vickie , open up . i need to come in .

i 'm sick of it . i ca n't watch you this way . you 're too drunk all the time . there 's too many girls . i ca n't ... i do n't wan na talk about it . i made up my mind .

no . this time it 's true . i did n't bother to tell you until i had everything worked out .

i want to say something to you without you blowing your stack .

you 're not only an animal , you 're a stupid animal . you 're rotten . rotten . rotten . you 're a sick maniac . a maniac ! you belong in a mental hospital .

you did ?

i 'll say anything you want me to say . i fuckled salvy . i fucked tommy . i fucked your brother . i fucked everybody ! what do you want to hear ? i sucked your brother 's fuckin ' cock !

you 're a fuckin ' liar .

i went with sandy and vera . salvy was there . stop it . i just had a drink , that 's all . i did n't do anything wrong .

i got bored so i went to the movies .

i took the kids to my sister 's .

i went out .

what 's the matter with you ?

you do n't kiss like that . hello and goodbye , that 's all you do .

you 're the one who said he was good looking . you think he 's good looking 'cause i know you think he 's good- looking . i 'll smash his face inside out . i 'll make him into dog meat . nobody 's gon na think he 's good-looking when i get through with him . so you just go ahead and think about who you want .

i never noticed his face .

then why 'd you say that thing about tony janiro ?

yeah , what ?

in other words , you 're not interested in him but you 'd be interested in somebody else , right ?

i was just ...

who asked you ?

what do you mean , `` good looking ? ''

oh , jake .

jake , you made me promise not to get you excited .

now take the rest off .

take off my pants .

that 's all right . he do n't mind .

jake , this is your father 's bedroom .

what does that mean ?

just give it a nice little tap .

oh no ? i thought you was a movie star .

you do n't talk very much .

this janiro 's a good fighter , pretty good-lookin ' kid .

he should .

excuse me , i 'm talking to my sister in-law .

and i 'm gon na finish my drink . and , i 'm gon na have a good time , because i ai n't doing nothing wrong .

he has it . thank you .

well , if he calls in , tell him to get in touch with l. b. jefferies right away . i might have quite a surprise for him .

bryce , the only man for this job is sitting right here in town . get me l. b. jefferies .

indo-china -- jeff predicted it would go sky-high .

it was in her favorite handbag -- and , mr. doyle , that can lead to only one conclusion .

i do n't know what pet name thorwald had for his wife . and that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase . he was n't taking his possessions , because they 're up in his apartment now !

a possibility .

i told you that --

this is doyle , jeff .

that depends on who `` they '' were .

oh -- that phone call ! i gave them your number -- hope you do n't mind .

your logic is backward .

but i 'm not a killer !

you sure it belongs to his wife ?

ever get an answer ?

you know , every day for three years i asked myself that same question ?

how did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years ?

now do n't get me mad ! even a detective ca n't walk in anybody 's apartment and search it . if i were ever caught in there , i 'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes !

what 's the matter ? does he have a courtesy card from the police department ?

i ca n't do that .

if possible -- both .

i hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered . now did anyone , including you , actually see her murdered ?

the superintendent met thorwald coming back . he said thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country .

what time ?

then where is she -- in the ice box ?

by the way what happened to your leg ?

thanks .

all right -- you do n't believe me .

you 've got a lot to lean about homicide , jeff . morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them . that salesman would n't just knock off his wife after dinner , toss her in a trunk and put her in storage .

i 'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things . murder is the least likely .

jeff --

jeff -- wives do n't nag anymore -- they discuss .

like what ?

i 've been taking pictures so long i do n't know how to read anymore .

read some good books .

so did you . goodbye , jeff .

swell . i get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments .

you 're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with . i 'll send morgan or lambert .

stop sounding stuffy . i 'll take pictures from a jeep . from a water buffalo if necessary .

with that cast on -- you do n't .

did n't i tell you ! did n't i tell you it was the next place to watch ?

indo-china . got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning . the place is about to go up in smoke .

this is wednesday .

who said i was getting rid of it ?

for what ?

jefferies .

tell her to bring it back !

no .

can you get me that ring back ?

did you get my note ?

hello .

what about the rest ?

how much do you think you 'll need ?

stella -- how long do you think he 'll stay there ?

there 's probably one in the basement .

got a shovel ?

you do n't say ! i might just take that compliment as an insult .

look !

you mean the one the dog was sniffing around ?

oh . well , yes and no . it was n't an official call . he 's just a friend . an old , ornery friend .

goodbye , mr. jefferies . i 'll see you tomorrow .

get back there ! he 'll see you !

his personal effects . he 's probably running away -- the coward .

now what could he sell at three in the morning ?

it 's hard to figure . he went out several time last night , in the rain carrying his sample case .

i was .

okay -- but i 'm going to spread some common sense on the bread . lisa fremont 's loaded to her fingertips with love for you . i 'll give you two words of advice . marry her .

we 've progressed emotionally in --

i can just hear you now . `` get out of here you perfect , wonderful woman ! you 're too good for me ! ''

you 're never going to marry ?

can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week 's salary in the bank ? if only she was ordinary .

no .

i do n't want to .

those sultry sun-worshipers you watch have n't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks .

how can you tell that from a thermometer !

right now i 'd even welcome trouble .

readers ' digest , april , 1939 .

it is something really important , jeff ?

not a word .

get an ambulance . do n't move . try to lie still .

maybe i can get thorwald out of the apartment .

now hold on . i 'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but i do n't care to watch two women end up like that dog --

suppose mrs. thorwald 's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag . during that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band .

something 's in there . those flowers have been taken up , and put back again .

well ?

do you think this was worth waiting all day to see ?

whatever happened to that old saying `` love thy neighbor . ''

you and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man did n't kill his wife . we 're two of the most frightening ghouls i 've ever known .

of course , they have the same chance . they can look at me like a bug under glass , if they want to .

surprise -- is the most important element of attack . and beside , you 're not up on your private eye literature . when they 're in trouble , it 's always their girl friday who gets them out of it .

you are . you have a talent for creating difficult situations .

i 'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night .

that 's a suitcase ?

i have the whole weekend off .

that 's what the witnesses told him .

and you , and you friend doyle -- did you hear from him again -- since he left ?

all day long i 've tried to keep my mind on work .

not yet !

suppose he does n't come back again ?

someone not his wife ?

yeah .

you could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up , and walked along the corridor , and the streets and the backyard ?

what are you getting at ?

there 's nothing to see .

jeff -- if you could only see yourself .

why would a man leave his apartment three times , on a rainy night , with a suitcase ? and come back three times ?

do n't you ever have any problems ?

i 'm not exactly on the other side of the room .

ca n't we just sort of keep things status quo ?

and it 's deflating to find out that the only way i can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine . i guess i 'm not the girl i thought i was .

three .

ever get shot at , run over , sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera ?

almost as if it were being written especially for us .

how can you tell that -- from here ?

miss lonely hearts . at least that 's something you 'll never have to worry about .

that 's what i 'm afraid of . could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard ?

do n't laugh . -- i could do it !

you mean leave the magazine ?

make the one you want .

jeff -- is n't it time you came home ? you could pick your assignment .

someday you might want to open up your own studio here .

tired ?

-- a steal at eleven hundred dollars .

anything else bothering you ?

not too active .

and you love life ?

empty as a football .

assault with a deadly weapon .

hey ! that 's enough static out of you .

they 're killing him !

no ! i got to find him .

you disappointed ?

here we are -- out of cigarettes -- junior 's in the nurs'ry -- see how late it gets --

maybe he 's scared of the dark .

i do n't know -- you just are . leaving a light for plato . that was nice .

hi .

i bet you hear everything i say !

you see , we 've just -- oh , you tell him , darling . i 'm so embarrassed i could die !

oh , jim !

i felt like it .

i 'm sorry i treated you mean today . you should n't believe what i say when i 'm with the kids . nobody acts sincere .

no ? why not ? you know something ? sometimes i figure i 'll never live to see my next birthday . is n't that dumb ?

i swear , sometimes , you just want to hold onto somebody ! judy , what am i going to do ? i ca n't go home again .

i 'm numb .

yeah . so where 's the high school ?

my mother ?

what ?

no .

he calls me a dirty tramp -- my own father !

i do n't think . i know . he looks at me like i 'm the ugliest thing in the world . he does n't like my friends -- he --

what ?

he hates me .

what ?

good evening .

are you and mom home tonight ?

we used to sing it in school . do n't look at me with such horror . they had schools in those days .

gabriel !

mmm , baby . and i 'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree ...

that 's a book , baby . that 's a book of love .

we need to find a way to make me part of it .

i 'm going to have to be inside that casino . when it happens . i 'll need to be part of it . i ca n't just be drawing some map .

you saved my life . you could have run , but you did n't . you saved me .

jesus christ , stay here , do n't move , stay right here --

i wo n't let him hurt you ! he just wants what you know !

nick died for me ... .

i love you !

when 'd you decide to do it , ash ? after which of his letters , huh ? the fortieth ? the fiftieth ? the first ? !

nick , no --

what the fuck is going on .

i wo n't let 'em , nick . they wo n't hurt you anymore .

nick ...

ashley . we 're not going anywhere i used to work .

security , ash , i just worked security . they would n't be rolling out the red carpet --

well , i do n't know about that --

baby , c'mon , all this stuff ... i have n't gotten you anything --

ash ... did n't you write me that you do n't eat chocolate ?

then he shoulda signed his name .

thought you wrote you had a mustache .

no , no --

how 'd you know my name .

what , we walking in there and delivering toys ?

you got ta be kidding me .

i 'm no threat without a gun .

no way .

you go in with five , you 're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free . someone hits an alarm , you 're fucked . someone gets to a phone , gets outside , 'cross the street , whatever , you 're fucked . you need six . six is me .

... ttt..tt ... two out of three ?

... never ... tried ...

do i get a country-western name ?

put it on .

they wo n't recognize me .

you 'd have to get me inside . get inside , watch where the money 's moving , see where the guards are going . then i could work with your map .

hell . ten ?

christmas ... eve ...

the hell you do n't .

what 's her middle name ?

where 's she work ?

a girl says she loves you , you say something .

she says a lot of things .

you 're a good writer , nick . i give this writing an a-plus .

yes !

yes !

yes !

but you were saying you were ...

i shared his cell !

i was in the joint with him ! i knew about him and her , okay ! ? i took his place !

put him in the truck .

you got the wrong guy ! she thinks i 'm nick , i 'm not !

who are you now .

the hell i ca n't .

oh , i know you , nick . i know you real well .

i ca n't ! go back ! i ca n't ! go back ! i ca n't ! go back !

he 's not nick mason ...

i do n't know ... what you 're ...

show 's over .

i 'm bringing in this great showroom act next week ; these three russian girls , they look like meryl streep , they can juggle anything .

there 's no snow in vegas , 'kay ? they do n't know it , they do n't want it , they got laws against the stuff . they got egypt down there , right , they got monte carlo , hawaii , they got ancient rome , but where 's the winter castle , right ? where 's the swiss miss chalet ? where 's the big fucking igloo ?

the powwow safe . the secret safe . you said the manager 's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money .

what about the powwow safe ?

somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon --

this trucker ? met a girl in a bar one night , she did n't know his situation . he 's drunk , she 's drunk , they get to mackin ' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it . his tongue . sucks it right down .

acid-chewer .

there anytime you do n't got a mouthful of shit ?

no , the place . the remodeling . moving everything around .

how long ago was your makeover ?

five years . since it opened .

you got pug killed ! you tried to get me killed ! you just lost your get- outta-jail-free --

drop 'em ! drop , drop , drop ! ! !

you got ta get someone upstairs .

what you got ta worry about first is the guards . place does n't look much richer than when i worked there , so let 's figure you 're gon na have to deal with ten of 'em . there 'll be two on the floor , walking the room , that leaves eight up above . eyes in the sky . they see something up , they 're the ones who 'll hit the silent alarm and you 're fucked .

not with you .

there are monsters ... ... in the gelatin ...

it 's a roach , guy --

always wanted to rob that casino , rudy . way back when i worked there . what better way than to get some guys to rob it for me .

... for christmas ...

no ! ! !

tell ashley ... i ...

tell her ... i 'll be there ...

no , man ! no , no , no !

ash ... ashley ...

guard ! ! !

good for you . protein .

hotwiring cars , rudy , does not qualify as a small business . chop shop consultant ; does n't work on a resume .

thought you hate your old man .

mornin ' , gorgeous . more egg nog ?

what if she sees you , man , sees what you look like ... and it 's not there . you just do n't do it for her .

i 'm just talking .

why you got ta say a thing like that .

yeah . fuckin ' christmas .

yeah .

three days , man .

what 's the first thing , man ? what 's the first thing you 're gon na do ?

they 'll open one !

who the hell made this map .

yes .

i asked you a question . are you clear about that ?

first off , i do n't have a boss . are you clear about that ?

i wan na . but i got ta show this asshole i got an honest-to-goodness job before he 'll let me move out on my own . i ca n't work for you guys and be worried about gettin ' back before ten o'clock curfew .

scagnetti ? oh shit , i hear he 's a motherfucker .

i might break you , nice guy , but i 'd make you my dog 's bitch . you 'd be suckin ' the dick and going down on a mangy t-bone hound .

how ya doin ' , toothpick ?

stop pointing your fuckin ' gun at daddy !

how do you know all this ?

it makes perfect fuckin ' sense to me . eddie , you did n't see how he acted during the job , we did .

was he all pissed off ?

i do n't know what he did to her , but she got even .

elois ?

let me tell you guys a story . in one of daddy 's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named elois .

who ?

you ai n't dying , he is .

let me say this out loud , just to get it straight in my mind . according to you , mr. blonde was gon na kill you . then when we came back , kill us , grab the diamonds , and scram . that 's your story ? i 'm correct about that , right ?

well , whoever she was , elois looked like her . so one night i walk into the club , and no elois . now the bartender was a wetback , he was a friend of mine , his name was carlos . so i asked him `` hey , carlos , where 's lady e tonight ? '' well apparently lady e was married to this real piece of dog shit . i mean a real animal . and apparently he would so things to her .

the black beverly hills . i knew this lady from ladora heights once . `` hi , i 'm from ladora heights , it 's the black beverly hills . ''

i got ta go along with mr. pink on this . i 've seen it happen .

what does it matter who stays with the cop ? we ai n't lettin ' him go . not after he 's seen everybody . you should 've never took him outta your trunk in the first place .

i take it this is the bastard you told me about . why the hell are you beating on him ?

okay , mr. detective , who did it ?

hey , fuck you man , you were n't there , we were . and i 'm tellin ' ya , the cops had that store staked out .

what ? nobody set anybody up .

i can do that .

something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job .

what ?

it 's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal .

a undercover cop has got to be marlon brando . to do this job you got to be a great actor . you got to be naturalistic . you got to be naturalistic as hell . if you ai n't a great actor you 're a bad actor , and bad acting is bullshit in this job .

what ?

what 's this ?

fuckin ' a. i tell it real good , too .

yeah . they had just won the night before , and he made a killing off 'em .

a little .

you ever seen this motherfucker before ?

i 'm sorry .

you two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds . we 're there for those stones , period . since no display cases are being fucked with , no alarms should go off . we 're out of there in two minutes , not one second longer . what if the manager wo n't give up the diamonds ?

mr. brown stays in the car . he 's parked across the street till i give him the signal , then he pulls up in front of the store .

... her brother usually goes with her , but he 's in county unexpectedly .

i just wanted you to know , they meant a lot .

who 's your parole officer ?

it 's a change .

fuck you , wrong . i 'm right ! what the fuck do you know about it anyway ? you 're still listening to jerry- fucking-vale .

wong ?

chew ? toby chew ? no .

then one day she meets a john holmes motherfucker , and it 's like , whoa baby . this mother fucker 's like charles bronson in `` the great escape . '' he 's diggin ' tunnels . now she 's gettin ' this serious dick action , she 's feelin ' something she ai n't felt since forever . pain .

oh fuck , toby 's that little china girl .

it 's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy . now granted that 's what `` true blue '' is about , no argument about that .

dead as dillinger .

i tried that once , it do n't work . you get four guys fighting over who 's gon na be mr. black . since nobody knows anybody else , nobody wants to back down . so forget it , i pick . be thankful you 're not mr. yellow .

larry , i 'm askin ' you to trust me on this .

like hell i am .

what 's the cut , poppa ?

what for ?

not a problem , got guys waitin ' for it . but what happened to marsellus spivey ? did n't he always move your ice ?

blonde , shoot this piece of shit , will ya ?

who gives a damn ?

no , she did it . she killed the cheatin ' wife , too .

you gon na put it away ?

what 's that ?

shut up ! cough up the buck , ya cheap bastard , i paid for your goddamn breakfast .

nope .

what the fuck are they waiting for ? that motherfucker cut off my ear ! he slashed my face ! i 'm deformed !

marvin , i need you to hold on . there 's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away .

i do . how do i look ?

freddy newendyke .

you do ?

i do n't like alarms .

you see what i been puttin ' up with ? as soon as i walk through the door i 'm hit with this shit . i tell 'm what you told me about us stayin ' put and mr. white whips out his gun , sticks it in my face , and starts screaming `` you motherfucker , i 'm gon na blow you away , blah , blah , blah . ''

because this guy 's a fucking psycho . and if you think joe 's pissed at us , that ai n't nothing compared to how pissed off i am at him , for puttin ' me in the same room as this bastard .

for what , the cops ?

it 's a surprise .

why ?

what was that ? i 'm sorry , i did n't catch it . would you repeat it ?

what 's my problem ? yeah , i got ta problem . i got ta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot !

uhuh , uhuh , what 's i tell ya ? that sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho .

i 'm going to die ! i need a doctor ! i 'm begging you , take me to a doctor .

i can ' take you to a hospital .

say-the-goddamn-words : you 're gon na be okay !

these ladies are n't starvin ' to death . they make minimum wage . when i worked for minimum wage , i was n't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy .

i 'd go over twelve percent for that .

can you believe the songs they been playin ' ?

not these guys .

okay , mr. expert . if this is such a truism , how come every nigger i know treats his woman like a piece of shit ?

then . that time has passed . right now , mr. blonde is the only one i completely trust . he 's too fuckin ' homicidal to be workin ' with the cops .

do n't fuckin ' patronize me .

he asked .

well , he knows a little about me .

he ai n't dead .

that kid in there is dying from a fuckin ' bullet that i saw him take . so do n't be calling him a rat .

oh , you and joe go back a long time . i known joe since i was a kid . but me saying joe definitely could n't have done it is ridiculous . i can say i definitely did n't do it , cause i know what i did or did n't do . but i ca n't definitely say that about anybody else , 'cause i do n't definitely know . for all i know , you 're the rat .

i swear to god i 'm fuckin ' jinxed .

where ? are they out in the car ?

i got 'em , all right ?

nope .

i think he 's a sick fuckin ' maniac ! we 're awful goddamn lucky he did n't tag us , when he shot up the place . i came this fucking close - to taking his ass out myself . everybody panics . when things get tense , everybody panics . everybody . i do n't care what your name is , you ca n't help it . it 's human nature . but ya panic on the inside . ya panic in your head . ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic , then you get a grip and deal with the situation . what you do n't do , is shoot up the place and kill everybody .

you 're right , this is bad . how did you get out ?

okay , let 's go through what happened . we 're in the place , everything 's going fine . then the alarm gets tripped . i turn around and all these cops are outside . you 're right , it was like , bam ! i blink my eyes are they 're there . everybody starts going apeshit . then mr. blonde starts shootin ' all the -

why not ?

as opposed to good ?

how the fuck do you think ? the cops shot him .

gun shot .

waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country . it 's the one job basically any woman can get , and make a living on . the reason is because of tips .

so 's working at mcdonald 's , but you do n't feel the need to tip them . they 're servin ' ya food , you should tip em . but no , society says tip these guys over here , but not those guys over there . that 's bullshit .

what 's she doin ' runnin ' around the country at night .

like you said , maybe he knows where my ranch is . if he does , he 'll be waiting on the porch .

and that 's more important than finding lednov ?

graham 's got something to tell you might interest you .

why did n't you say so . go right out and get her . ed . build the fire up .

and one of 'em is sick .

tell them to come on in .

because ... well , you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there ... tonight i was sort of tied up with steve ... but tomorrow i figured on doing just that .

where you going ?

thanks for loading me on the stage . i know now why you did it .

fine -- maybe i 'll see you there sometime .

there wo n't be any rest of the trip . over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along . so keep your money . you 'll need it for the fare . i 'm fed up with you . i was fed up with you before we started .

then let 's get started . the sooner i get to sonora , the better i 'll like it .

i 'm awake now . go on . say what you want to say . i 'll listen .

so that 's it -- you think i was making fun of your girl in gingham .

you know so much about me -- figure it out .

not on this trail , i do n't . i 've been over it before . anyway , you ought to be pretty sleepy . why do n't you climb in back .

he knows his alphabet .

but the rest is right .

you should know . she 's in your dream .

i hope so , too .

no , thanks . i hope we wo n't be a burden to them .

coffee ?

it 's a long walk back to aspen .

can we get a doctor at that ranch ?

are the horses stragglin ' or are n't they ?

he 's learning his letters .

get back to the horses . they 're straggling .

like sticking his nose into other people 's business .

if you were in his shoes would you take one of us home ?

it 's a nice place owned by an old couple named wyatt .

too much excitement . or maybe it 's just the heat . how about the surrey . can you fix it ?

what 's the matter with her ?

as far as -- sonora ?

she 's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while i was n't around .

a fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden , he do n't take chances . my name 's clayton and i 'm looking for someone .

then do n't come sneakin ' around a man 's camp .

which ranch ?

guess maybe i 'm old enough to hold my own in a fight , huh ?

is that the only reason you came back ?

what did you come back for ?

she told me not to fight with you anymore . she said it was n't your fault , but -- i figure different ...

i do n't care what she asked you .

i 'll eat when i 'm good and ready .

that ai n't why . i just figure it 's about time to start runnin ' my own life .

all right , i hurt your feelings . but you know better than to go lightin ' fires .

do n't go arguing with your teacher .

there 's only two of them now .

maybe you shoulda killed him .

oh ... that 's the time you went away .

i wo n't again .

it 's all right with me if she teaches you , but i do n't want you forgettin ' your job .

where 'd they go ?

lednov .

sure a lot of guys lookin ' for lednov .

do you have to be so close-mouthed ? i 'm your brother . and i 'm ridin ' with you . remember ?

in a fight ?

what was he in jail for ?

you never said this lednov 's name before , that i can remember .

i do n't want to run short .

you might tell a fellow things , 'specially if the fellow 's your brother , seems to me .

that 's right .

all right , you did n't know .

go away -- please .

darling -- now i 've got you all upset .

not if i know mary . when she rides into sonora , you 'll be with her . and mighty glad to be there after this . i do n't see how you stood it as long as you did .

it is n't that --

helen -- why do n't you and mary go on with clay ?

no . but it 's mine and i did n't want anyone foolin ' with it .

yeah .

even women ?

i knew something would happen when they started puttin ' up fences and passin ' laws .

depends on how good you drive .

until you came along we were going to sonora .

sounds fine . only that is n't how it 's going to be .

he certainly could . about a month .

we do n't want to go there .

why did n't you say you wanted to get married back in aspen . i told the man in sonora there were four of us . if only three show up , he might call the whole deal off . we 've got to stick together . like we 've always done .

you think that 's all we busted -- you should see ...

maybe in sonora .

how far up the trail ?

stop it --

how do you know who we are ?

i said i had a guy to see and i 'm going to see him .

one night more wo n't matter . your friend 'll be there . anyway i do n't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch . he knows you 're out so he ai n't going to sit still for it .

what are you doin ' --

will you quit gabbin ' and do what you 're told .

put on another one .

i was doin ' both . here .

oh , i was n't worrying . i saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave .

i feel good anyways .

then if they was n't alive , how can they be an animal ? ...

kind of tough , i guess ... but you 're not liable to hunt them -- i do n't think there 's any alive now , anyways -- and i 'm not sure but i do n't think there ever were ...

good night , miss wells .

did someone say i was n't nice ?

that 'd be swell . you know , you 're an awful lot different than i thought you 'd be .

i sure would .

since i can remember , ma'am .

wife ? !

me , too . 101 ?

okay ... maybe that would be best .

oh ... i guess i 'll die now .

help !

you better be careful . i heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today . hey , what class do we have next ?

oh my god . madam elsa , my psychic , told me i would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today .

okay .

where 's shorty ?

he 's so brave .

hello ray .

that 's what your man is supposed to do .

oh , buddy , i 've never had someone be so protective of me !

hey , look out , a bee !

that sounds kinda gay , but since you 're a guy , i guess it 's okay .

you know , walking on the beach , holding hands , kissing , making love ...

yeah , i know , i just love having a guy for a friend .

actually , i was going to say let me have your computer if you die .

he 's here .

i was thinking the same thing .

wow , she 's beautiful . you really think she looks like me ?

dude , somebody 's on the rag .

okay .

sure . we can practice talking .

yeah , it will be fine . i wan na check something out . will you come with me ?

sure , that would be cool . friends .

but , hey , maybe we can be friends .

yeah .

i meant you 're into ghosts .

what , you think i did this to myself ?

come on . we better get you cleaned up .

are you okay ?

i do n't know . he was right behind me a minute ago .

the ghost is close . he almost got us . buddy is hurt .

come in somebody . can you hear me ?

it 's the sequel .

noooo ! ! !

hanson , please .

i 'm cindy .

someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform .

we have to destroy him .

quick , everyone to the lab .

would you like me to help you pass them back ?

soon , but first i must bless this house .

me and my friends ... you see there was this ghost . he came out of nowhere and ... .

hey , y'all ! what 's going on ?

i 'm going to work in washington , cindy .

yeah , i did n't know what else to do .

aww , the little bird died .

almost ... look , i got ta bounce . i 'll holla at you later .

you could use the grade , huh ?

no , i 'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals , and it is likely it did attack , but it does n't mean it was possessed . maybe the two of you should sleep together .

theo , did you see the animal ?

i 'm telling you , it was possessed .

that 's fantastic . our first phenomenon . this is going to be a great weekend . you guys better get some sleep . dwight and i will take over from here .

the keys . she took the keys .

congratulations , dwight , it 's begun .

i do n't think so . it 's on all the cameras , and check this out . the thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded .

yes . the scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter just like you asked for .

i ca n't believe mr. stubbins is dead .

`` serial mom '' ? wow !

you see the sign ! it 's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time i 'm gon na charge you ! $ 2.99 plus one dollar is $ 3.99 !

mrs. jensen , i 've told you . you have to rewind the tapes before returning them !

this is so silly .

god , mom ! what 's the matter ?

can we watch that scene again ? you know , where he rips out her heart ? pleeease ?

oh mom ...

oh god , really ! this is the limit !

cute is not enough , misty . you know that .

i 'm sorry he 's dead , but ... have you signed off yet ?

that 's right .

bird books mostly ...

i ca n't believe i thought my own mother was a murderess !

he goes to college with me !

beverly , i 've been reading all about it ... is it menopause ?

it 's a shame . but they should brush their teeth , honey .

oooohhh ! yeah ! yeah !

you 're not bad yourself , coo-coo bird ...

do n't i get a kiss ?

goodnight , honey .

nothing like a home cooked meal , honey .

no woman would !

nice ? ! he should have been executed !

... people who do n't mind their own business .

`` p '' as in ...

i know dottie !

det . bradford , i 'm sorry but we do n't allow gum chewing in this house .

let the record show i 'm just standing here .

did you see her ? ! she just said `` fuck you '' to me !

so you do drink ?

i certainly was not !

so you were n't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls ?

no , i do n't .

but ... but ... she ... rosemary , i heard her voice ! it 's her , i tell you , it 's her !

and we 're going right to the flea market to get another one ! misty tells me there 's a whole booth of franklin mint stuff . dottie , you lock up . i 'll take care of poor rosemary !

i did n't do it !

what did you just say ?

i beg your pardon ?

is n't this 4215 pussy way ?

i ... i 'm not sure ... ... i ... oohhh ... excuse me ...

damn these yellow-jackets ! i hate 'em !

sorry , mom . thanks . hey , chip , think i could get 50c for vanilla ice .

it 's sugarless .

and those were your scissors found sticking out of mrs. sterner 's stomach , were n't they ?

yes , but i lent it ...

that was your people magazine with the letters cut out , was n't it ?

carl padgett died for the franklin mint , did n't he ? !

i did n't want that faberge egg - it was chipped !

i saw one , but it was ridiculously overpriced !

did you find your franklin mint egg , rosemary darling ?

who on earth would want to harass poor dottie hinkle ?

just the damn cable tv company . you know how they are . did you hear about dottie hinkle ?

divorce ? an alcoholic relative ? tell me , did chip torture animals when he was young ?

he is assistant manager of a video shop ...

what is it , mr. stubbins ?

oooohh ! a fruit cake . thank you , mrs. sutphin . have a seat .

nice to meet you , mr. stubbins . a little something i baked .

mrs. sutphin , i 'm paul stubbins , chip 's math teacher .

right here !

from what i understand , the eye- witness is a drug user .

how to send a bill ! !

nice one , huh ? winter 's coming . three dollars ? ... i guess that 's what i marked it ...

i 'll take this instead .

that 's a franklin mint piece . eight dollars .

young man , this faberge egg is chipped .

that girl was looking for jacqueline gibson . i 'd forget it if i were you .

no .

sister , you ca n't just go breaking into places . there 's a night watchman down there and locks on the door .

you think my sister is there ?

yes . she bought my sister 's business .

i have n't any money but i 'll get a job and --

you can ?

may i have some water ? i 'm thirsty .

it does n't matter . you want to now . you should want to . it 's your obligation , your duty .

but tell me --

how much have you got ?

how much does she want ?

as a man , you distrust me - perhaps you believe me as a physician .

do you know what this is , frances ?

thank you .

what does she do with herself after business hours ?

she seems rather an odd woman to me .

redi 's all right .

i ca n't see much fun in teaching school . why do n't you go into the beauty business .

i 'll try there .

`` the dante ? ''

i ca n't understand it at all .

i know . for the first time i 'm beginning to be frightened . i almost feel as if i 'd never known my sister .

hello , frances .

why , mary --

what did she want ?

a poet . he 's sitting right over there . that 's his table the one at the feet of dante .

there is a very simple way . got a telephone book ?

you 've never believed a word i told you about mr. august .

oh , i 'm making investigations .

maybe the romaris might have a room . they seem nice .

but you have treated me that way .

yes , of course but the police would say you 'd probably had a bad dream .

this is about another murder a woman at fifty second street

afraid she might commit suicide ? people who commit suicide do n't talk about it . that room made her happy in some strange way i could n't understand . she lived in a world of her own fancy . she did n't always tell the truth . in fact - i 'm afraid she did n't know what the truth was . there were many things about jacqueline i did n't understand , and yet , without understanding , i had to be with her to see her to touch her in order to be happy . it 's hard to explain to a youngster .

were n't you afraid ?

but i 'd give a great deal to know .

we 're not exactly strangers , mary . jacqueline spoke about you often . i suppose she told you about me ,

what 's that ?

could you find him ?

he 's clever and he 's cautious in his way . if he knew i think he 'd advise her to do what i want - surrender herself to the police stand trial i do n't think he knows .

do you think he knows about this ?

and then ?

i 'm afraid .

yes . it 's been quiet , oh ever so quiet . i hardly move , yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer . i rest and rest and yet i am dying .

please , jacqueline .

i hate people who try to peddle comfort . but , mary , you should n't mourn for jacqueline . life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind . it 's better this way .

jacqueline . mr. romari phoned me . she went out this afternoon with two men he 'd never seen before .

i ca n't find gregory . i 've been trying to find him .

you went to see mrs. redi ... she told you something -- what was it ?

it 's because of jacqueline i ca n't go on looking for her --

i had begun to write again -that 's whet i was doing when you came in .

do n't make me tell you , jason .

it is n't that -- you said , `` have to go . '' what could compel you --

but you 're happy here -- you like your work -

i thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me -that it was your advent into my world . it turns out to be good-by . why ?

jason , i 'm going back to highcliffe . i came to say good-by .

i can imagine .

i have something even better .

and you knew he 'd be here .

you will have to make all the jokes , because i 'm going to be very serious .

we are happy , mrs. romari , because you have everything and i am happy because i have nothing to lose .

why ca n't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times . look at that poor little one so sad because she ca n't find her sister . and that man with her - he does n't make her laugh he just sits and talks .

jason , my pet

i 'm a good boy , but no one listens to what i say .

why , mr. jason . most of these books are on the closed shelf . you have to get permission .

no , not at all , mr. jason .

it 's here , too .

if you like , i 'll go with you to dinner .

perhaps

i should like people to read what i 've written .

i do n't think that you would understand if i told you .

she was my patient .

i do n't know .

yes . you could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets .

cloven hoof ?

but you have never liked jason . you always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --

this is incredible i it must be some sort of a joke .

you 're very flippant and perhaps wise , but not wise enough to see the truth , louis .

it would be a charming experience . she might only protest half as much .

unless what ?

i was a great dancer ...

i 'm afraid you have mistaken my motive , louis . i thought you might understand and sympathize .

yes . there are certain punitive measures ...

i always thought it was a more intimate relationship .

it seems right to us .

i had to help get rid of the body . you saw it on the subway . and i warn you , mary -- go back -- you do n't know what you 're doing , or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister . you go back to school - - go back and forget jacqueline .

i do n't believe it .

that wo n't be necessary . i have n't much to say .

i 'll be out in a minute .

this is mrs. redi , mary .

yes .

i did n't know .

mary , i 'm amazed . did n't jacqueline tell you ? she sold the business to me at least eight months ago . it 's my business now .

mrs. redi , there 's one thing -with jacqueline gone , how do you carry on the business ? what do you do with the receipts ? how do you sign checks -- ?

could you let me see that room ? if it is hers , there might be something there to help me find my sister .

once you 'd seen my sister you 'd never forget her .

of course .

i 'm worry to bother you . i want to ask you about my sister .

because i have something very important to do .

no , nancy . you 've got to sleep two more minutes .

but he also wrote --

it wo n't hurt .

graham ...

i want to touch you .

i do n't care .

i do n't find this `` turning the tables '' thing very interesting --

i ca n't tell you like this .

do n't do that .

yeah , you 're right . but i never claimed to know everything like you , and have all these little theories . i 'm still learning , i know that . but i do n't feel like i 've wasted time . if i had to go through my marriage to get to where i am right now , fine .

you mean you 're still in contact with her ?

but i feel like maybe i could be really comfortable with you .

if you were in love with me , would you ?

no , you 're not .

and you feel the same way with john ?

subtlety , yes . no subtlety . plus , i 've never really felt able to open up with anyone . i mean , that other person i told you about , i enjoyed making love with him a lot , but i still was n't able to really let go . i always feel like i 'm being watched and i should n't embarrass myself .

now i make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me .

so you lied to her ?

what was the problem ?

yes .

that 's correct .

you said you were n't always impotent .

no .

on tape ?

yes .

i remember . you could do that , could n't you ? go down on me ?

i thought i made that clear before , when i said i would go down on you .

i fantasized about you .

because that 's how cynthia thinks ! ! all she does is think about that stuff , and i hate that , i do n't want to be like her , i do n't want to be like her ! !

then as far as this taping goes , you have nothing to worry about .

i do n't see what difference it makes , i mean , i can think what i want . i do n't know if i want to do this anymore , i 'm afraid ... i do n't mind answering the questions so much , but if somebody were to see this ...

absolutely not .

sometimes . afterward .

do you talk to him ?

load a new tape , turn the camera on .

what difference does it make why i do it ?

it 's not my place to tell you these things , ann . you have to find out by yourself or from john directly . you have to trust me on this .

i know .

i know .

i 'm sorry this came up .

to you ?

mostly . sometimes they do things .

you just ask them questions ?

all of these are interviews ?

donna ?

it 's a personal project i 'm working on .

videotapes .

not much to see , i 'm afraid . i 'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe .

i just wanted to see how the place looked furnished .

nothing i ca n't finish later .

now , you said never take advice from someone that you do n't know intimately , right ?

oh , see , i meant someone you 've had sex with . that 's part of the theory .

are n't you ?

well , i 've been watching you . i 've watched you eat , i 've watched you speak , i 've watched the way you move , and i see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at . i think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time . and you know what ?

why do you say i 'm self-conscious ?

you 're what ?

i do n't know , he just said he wants to wait . i quit asking .

do you want them ?

do you understand what i 'm trying to say ?

i know that i just do n't feel a connection with very many people , so i do n't waste time with people i do n't feel one with .

no .

what 's the first ?

sister older or younger ?

that 's hard to believe . the two of you seem so different .

oh , lots of reasons , most of them boring . but , up until i dropped out , john and i were ... very much alike .

yes . i was surprised that he accepted when i asked if i could stay here until i found a place .

nine years .

how long has it been since you 've seen john ?

did you know that if you shut someone up in a room , and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four , that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule ? simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four , the body follows . and then there are sections of time . your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . for instance , when i was twelve , i had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship . now , i 'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time , but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to , and then were crystallized in , that eleven minutes .

oh . well , i did . i was in a band once , and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible .

well ...

no , i think you look ... fine .

yeah , i guess it is . my mother is a complete anglophile , anything british makes her drool like a baby . she probably heard the name in some movie . she 's a prisoner of public television now .

yes .

yes .

god damn you ! !

bastard ...

yes !

i want out of this marriage .

i want out of this marriage .

i 'm sorry . it 's just ... i 'm under a lot of pressure with this kirkland thing , it 's my first big case as junior partner , and i work all day , i come home , i look forward to seeing you , and ... it hurts that you accuse me like that .

goddam right . i mean , can you imagine : `` your honor , i 'm positive this man is guilty . i ca n't place him at the scene or establish a motive , but i have this really strong feeling . ''

for god 's sake , ann , i am not fucking your sister . i do n't find her that attractive , for one .

i ca n't tell you how upset i would be if you were lying .

there 's nothing to know , ann .

no , i 'm not . frankly , i 'm offended at the accusation .

i ate by myself .

yes . i just got busy .

i know , but this ... i just feel like everybody i know right now is obsessed with sex .

because all she thinks about are these guys she 's after and i just hate her she 's such a little slut i thought that in high school and i think that now . why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what 's the big damn deal ? i mean , it 's okay and everything , but i do n't understand when people let it control them , control their lives , why do they do that ?

why ?

i hate my sister .

do you want to leave therapy ?

that you are under no obligation to me ?

i guess .

what do you mean ? i do n't understand .

i thought that 's what i did . who was it that you talked to ?

is he still at your house ?

the friend of john 's that was staying at your house .

what visitor ?

what do you mean ?

but see , he stopped before i got that feeling , that 's why it seems weird to me . i mean , i 'm sure he wishes i would initiate things once in awhile , and i would except it never occurs to me , i 'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that i have felt like starting something i was by myself .

about a week ago . i do n't know what brought it on , i just started feeling like i did n't want him to touch me .

what do you mean ?

well , this weekend john was taking out the garbage , and he kept spilling things out of the container , and i started imagining a container that grew garbage , like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself , and how could you stop that if it started happening ?

nothing . i mean , nothing . i try not to do anything that will produce garbage , so obviously we 're talking about eating and basic stuff like that . did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day ?

so what 's my share of the dress ?

you know what i mean , you do n't even know him !

why ?

listen to you ! ! you sound like mom . what are you talking about ?

in front of him , ann , yes .

he would n't do that .

cynthia , who knows where that tape may end up ? he could be ... bouncing it off some satellite or something . some horny old men in south america or something could be watching it .

i do n't ... he does n't want you to come over .

fine .

that goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune .

and ... do whatever it is you do .

i do n't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and ...

why ? just give me the address , you wo n't even have to be involved .

i have a pretty good idea .

ann , you always underestimate me .

you know what . you say it just to irritate me .

besides , even if i decided to fuck his brains out , what business is that of yours ?

jesus , ann , get a life . i just asked what he looked like .

why , so you can go after him ?

i just want to know what he looks like , is all .

i wish you 'd get an answering machine .

no .

i ca n't believe you 're doing this after i let you tape me .

i ca n't talk you into it ?

he said that my hand felt good .

what did he say ?

it was warmer than i thought it would be , and the skin was softer than it looked . it 's weird . thinking about it now , the organ itself seemed like a separate thing , a separate entity to me . i mean , after he pulled it out and i could look at it and touch it , i completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it . i remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me .

no . if anything , after i looked at it awhile , it got more interesting . it had character , you know ?

what did you think ? did it look like you expected ?

how unfortunate . so when did you finally get to see a penis ?

was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward ?

just a moment .

can i see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --

i turn on the camera . you start talking .

would anybody else see the tape ?

and that 's all ?

i just want to ask you questions .

nothing .

talking .

doing what ?

well , either you are or you are n't . which is it ?

she did n't give you my address ?

and are you here to berate me for making her that way ?

no , i really ca n't . i find it healthy never to characterize people i do n't know or conversations i have n't heard . i do n't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else . last time i saw ann she left here very ... confused , i would say . and upset .

i just want to know why you 're here .

i 'm ann millaney 's sister .

do i know you ?

i 'm cynthia bishop .

john , we have nothing to talk about .

if he had been under your prick you 'd have spotted him for sure .

well , i 'm here now . i 'd like to do something ...

that 's right . but i never took a vow in front of god and everybody to be `` faithful '' to my sister .

exactly what i said . i 'd trust him before i 'd trust you . how much clearer can i be ?

what do you mean ?

it wo n't . i trust him .

why not ?

well , you know him , he 's a friend of yours , do you think he can be trusted ?

i do n't think my sister would agree .

she 's there ? what 's she doing there ?

oh . well , when , then ?

hello .

sure . maybe he 's the man i 'm looking for . then i wo n't have to fuck worried husbands all the time .

no , i mean doing it at my house .

i hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time .

do n't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit . if you want to leave , leave . my life does n't stop when you walk out the door , you know what i 'm saying ?

i only get one today ? gee , how exciting .

how about for five hundred ?

will you lease month-to-month ?

you 're hesitating . i think that means you have .

i need help ? whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes , graham ? not me , buddy . you 're the fucking nut . now show me those tapes .

what the hell do you think ? i love ann . you think i 'm going to tell her about cynthia and hurt her feelings like that ?

she 's not property , john , she 's a person . were you just going to keep right on lying to her ?

you know which tapes ! where are they ?

hi , john .

what do you mean ?

so ? you 'll find out what 's wrong and then you 'll be able to relax a little bit . let him be the uptight one for a change .

with some milk jugs i just happened to pick up on the way home .

buy 'em with what , dumbhead ?

i ca n't , dummy . he 'll see that the pack 's been opened . you 're such a dumbhead .

c'mon , let 's smoke one of the cigarettes right now . your father 'll never miss it .

no , nothing .

medical clinic ?

but where are you going ?

do i get a kiss ?

mm ? ok. be with you in a sec .

i want to be able to see us , nick . i ... i 'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts , ok ? is that ok ? i want to be able to see us when we make love , ok ?

do you want to make love ? you 're absolutely beautiful , those eyes , that expression . you 're absolutely the most sexy thing alive . do you want to make love ?

can i call you at the office ?

oh , but the nurse , she went away . i think she must go to look for you .

yes ? who is there ?

well , let 's wait for the x-rays .

yep . she lived in 1208. but we usually went to my place . bigger liquor cabinet , bigger bed . she was gone when i got back from my last florida trip . too bad . had a beautiful tan . must have gone home to mother .

was this girl from starliner towers ?

good shape for an old man , eh ?

just breathe normally .

i dunno . try tranquilizers . once you can get at them , there 's a lotta stuff you can use . i 'll bring a bagful . it 's just the standard tropical kit . but the trick is to get at them .

that you , rog ?

but you 'll think about what i said about working together , huh ?

it was women did it to hobbes . could n't handle them . that girl , that annabelle -- talk about crazy projects .

rog , i got ta talk serious to you . really . listen . ya listening ? ok. i want you to come into this with me . to tell the honest-to-god truth , i 'm lonely . all hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night . he wanted you in anyway . that 's why we were gon na get together , the three of us . we would have enough to keep us going for at least five years , even with inflation .

right . it 's crazy . but here 's the beauty part . ready ? who cares ?

did i say anything ?

i 'm still a vd man under the skin , rog . you know me . i 'm a down-to-earth kinda guy , right ?

not exactly the kind of lunch hobbes would have laid on you , rog , but it 's all i got , and ... ... all i got i share with you . go ahead . take all you want .

breaking out

breaking out

i tell you what 's cooking . she made the blind see and it was a gift ! who was it from ? let 's hear an ' f '' for ...

check . the quacks are willing tools ?

of course .

i got it ! i got it ! ! !

about brad 's family ?

when do i get to see brad ?

looks like 'rest home ' for this marriage .

i know , i know , it 's just ...

so it seems .

we 're the experts .

farley is already a tv winner as we shall see . dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene .

sponsor ! ! !

are you spoken for this evening ?

overreact ! you 're the one with theories about conspirac ... oliver ?

now betty , do n't overreact .

ah yes . farley flavors . you know , i find it ...

bert brought them over from europe . they had a very popular series together . it 's still rerun in a lot of countries . you must have seen them in 'dentonvale ? '

mckinley ? ... mckinley ?

judge wright ? now , betty ? first name terms , surely !

i detect a note of reticence . are you , perhaps , one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative ?

in a way ...

oh . ah , i 'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am i ?

i 'm looking for trade

but i do n't need treadment .

i 'm not going , janet .

i do n't want to get up there .

that 's us .

you 've lost your heart

i 've took as much of you as any man can

i 've took as much of you as any man can you 've lost your heart

oh , harry . what are we going to do ?

what are you talking about ? danny slepstrini is a chip off the old block . i played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week . and hank says danny 's moved to new york . to better himself .

brad ! oh , brad .

what do you mean ?

your father does n't like mexicans .

oh . mom . it 's brad .

dentonvale ... say , that 's for ... i 'm sorry to hear that , janet . look i 'm going to let you through , but keep it to yourself , otherwise ...

janet . janet majors . it 's just that brad ... my husband ... is not ... very well and ... i do n't want to miss the next episode of dentonvale .

i need some

brad !

but what 'll i do ? what 'll i say ? what 'll i wear ?

absolutely true . compared to all of them , you are perfection , flawless beauty .

is it true they 're all midgets with big heads ?

brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you .

there are countless people in this world who believe they 're happy .

i 'm ... happy .

just one or two details . does he have any living relatives ? blood relatives ?

foods !

in the old series we did n't have a convertible .

you keep going back it 's driving you insane

he leaves you smoking ...

what a joke ...

you 're no good

this is the nerve center of operations , janet . you must stay here tonight . that way we can all be here when mr. sun paints us a new day with his golden brush .

yes how are you , janet ? are you happy ?

i do n't think he intends to go that far .

ah . mr. and mrs. majors . how wonderful to see you . i am dr. cosmo mckinley and this is my sister , and colleague , nation mckinley .

like a deep plum lipstick and some therapeutics

doctor derek sommersby ? you mean from `` one life to live '' ?

hang on . did you ever know a derek sommersby ?

no , we 're from san diego . why ?

you picked him up and you fucked him , did n't you , bitch ?

bye .

why are you being so defensive ?

do n't dismiss me . i 'm trying to include you in this decision . he 's your friend .

it 's christine . hey you .

are you there ? miles ?

busy night for a tuesday . we had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour . usually they 're not too rowdy , but tonight there was something going on . full moon or something . what can i get you ?

how 's it hanging , miles ?

absolutement . they have their own label that 's just outstanding .

lot of good stuff . got the new bien nacido . want a taste ?

i just remember you jogging . so when 's the wedding ?

and what was that other one you did , the one where you 're the jogger ?

you look fabulous , mrs. raymond .

well , you were wonderful on that show . i never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon . why that did n't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin . it 's a sin .

you said you loved me ! you fuck ! i hope you die !

hi . maya 's in the kitchen .

couple of wrong turns . thanks to magellan , here .

me too .

not so bad yourself .

great . you look great . you both do .

good . how 're you ?

oh yeah .

whatever you girls want . it 's on us tonight . sky 's the limit .

that 's hilarious . you sound just like one of those guys .

maybe . recognize this ?

anything i 'd know ?

that 's on us .

hiya .

yeah . hey , why was n't i injured ?

back at you .

no , not whatever . you fucking derelict .

look at this !

you said it looked like a car accident .

nothing . buckle up , okay ?

what 's wrong ?

i feel like driving .

you 're so negative .

yeah .

she tell you she was married ?

i left my wallet . my credit cards , cash , fucking id , everything . we got ta go back .

looks like you were in a bad car accident .

no , i did not . must have been gary at the hitching post . i think we mentioned it to him the first night .

you know -- hemingway , sexton , woolf , plath , delmore schwartz . you ca n't kill yourself before you 've even been published .

i do n't have to .

you ever actually been in there , miles ?

did you have trouble performing ? yeah , that 's ...

so tell me everything . details . i like details .

i said okay ?

we 're going to have some fun . remember fun ? we 're going to have some of it . okay ?

abattoir . huh . but you are going to get the good news this week about your book . i know you are . i can feel it .

is what the money thing ?

you know , in life you got ta strike when the iron 's hot .

oh yeah . sure .

look , miles , all i know is i 'm an actor . all i have is my instinct . my intuition -- that 's all i have . and you 're asking me to go against it . and that 's just wrong .

you 're crazy . you 've gone crazy .

deep .

um ... not exactly . but i 've been honest . i have n't told her i 'm available . and she knows this trip up here is only for a few days . besides ...

with this chick .

what ?

upstairs . getting cleaned up .

lucked out -- got voice mail . everything 's cool .

okay ! jesus !

later .

goddamn , miles , she is nasty . nasty nasty nasty .

stop it . you are blowing a great opportunity here , miles . fucking maya , man . she 's great . she 's cool . she 's funny . she knows wine . what is this morose come-down bullshit ? these girls want to party . and what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on , what was it , vouvrays ? i mean , come on !

pull yourself together , man .

okay ! fuck !

do not sabotage me . if you want to be a lightweight , that 's your call . but do not sabotage me .

so what should i wear ?

nah . i want to watch this .

cute ? she 's a fucking hottie . and you almost tell her i 'm getting married . what 's the matter with you ? got ta love it . got ta love it .

i 'm a quick learner .

i 'm going to be a fucking pariah . everyone 's just going to be holding their breath to see if i 'm going to get drunk and make a scene . plus tony fucking levin ?

because i knew you 'd freak out and probably get so depressed you would n't even come on this trip . but then i figured here would be the best place to tell you . we 're here to forget about all that shit . we 're here to party !

she what ? when ?

so what 're we going to have ? pigs in a blanket ? the `` rancher 's special breakfast '' ? or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard ?

fuck you .

she probably went home , lit some candles , put on some relaxing music , took a nice hot bath , and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator .

did n't seem to me like that 's what was going on . you were all over her .

i 'm trying to get you some action , but you 've got to help me out just a little bit .

the chick digs you . she lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published .

well , she does know a lot about wine .

does n't mean shit . when christine was a hostess at sushi roku , she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her . think it worked ? fuck no . how do you think i met her ?

jack , this is where i eat when i come up here . it 's practically my office . and sometimes i have a drink with the employees . maya 's great . she 's worked here about a year , maybe a year and a half .

sure i know maya .

you know her ?

here 's to my last week of freedom .

it does . feels right .

we 're not getting any younger , right ? and my career , well , it 's gotten pretty , you know , frustrating . even with my new manager . maybe it 's time to settle down .

hey jack , hurry up !

are you chewing gum ?

yeah , that would be a good move .

usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities , but this one 's pretty damn good . this is the new one , right , chris ?

now set your glass down and get some air into it .

huh . maybe a little strawberry . yeah , strawberry . i 'm not so sure about the cheese .

now tip it . what you 're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim . tells you how old it is , among other things , usually more important with reds . this is a very young wine , so it 's going to retain its color pretty solidly . now stick your nose in it .

depends on the varietal . just get a sense of it . thick ? thin ? watery ? syrupy ? inky ? amber , whatever ...

does n't have to be now . let 's go taste .

i told you . filet and salmon .

so what 'd you guys finally decide on for the menu ?

i like all varietals . i just do n't generally like the way they manipulate chardonnay in california -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation .

whatever 's closest , man . i need a glass .

jack . this week is not about me . it 's about you . i 'm going to show you a good time . we 're going to drink a lot of good wine , play some golf , eat some great food , enjoy the scenery and send you off in style .

well , i say fuck that . you need to get your joint worked on , that 's what you need .

i went on monday . but i spent most of the time helping him with his computer .

no . no . you 've been officially depressed for like two years now , and you were always a negative guy anyway , even in college . now it 's worse -- you 're wasting away . teaching english to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote . your books .

i 'd rather have a knife .

and miles is my best man , mrs. raymond . my main man .

um ... seventy ... something .

well , then i guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different .

i liked it a lot . a lot of improvements . it just seemed overall , i do n't know , tighter , more ... congealed or something .

oh , yeah . yeah .

jesus . do n't ask questions like that up in the wine country . they 'll think you 're a moron .

that 's a 1992 byron . it 's really rare . do n't open it now . i 've been saving it !

do n't open that now . it 's warm .

i do n't know . senior editor ? sounds like you 're in to me .

why did you tell them my book was being published ?

okay , there was a tasting last night . but i wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up . check out the box .

it 's miles . listen , i do n't know if you even care , but i had to call and tell you again how much i enjoyed our time together and how sorry i am things turned out the way they did . i think you 're great , maya -- always have . from the first time you waited on me . and while i 'm at it , i guess you should know that my book is not getting published . i thought this one had a chance , but i was wrong . again . do n't bother reading it -- you 've got better things to do . so you see i 'm not much of a writer . i 'm not anything really . the only real talent i seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand . we 're leaving in the morning , and i want you to know that i take with me wonderful memories of you . i 'm sorry . i 'm really sorry .

hi . it 's maya . please leave a message .

you know , i just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception . and i 've been doing just fine .

oh , just that he loves her . that she 's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world . how he adores siena . how he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to .

no , we 've got to get back friday for the rehearsal dinner .

well , nice to see you now .

hey , miles , i heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me .

okay . see you around .

i had a good time tonight , miles . i really did .

yeah ? like what ?

i commute to san luis obispo twice a week .

i started to get serious about seven years ago .

oh , yeah . steph 's way into pinots and syrahs . hey , steph ? you sure we can open anything ? anything we want ?

she got anything good ?

hey .

are you all right ?

i 'm having the salmon .

i know the winemaker . she comes in the restaurant all the time .

nice . very nice .

what are you drinking ?

the windmill .

you want to join us ?

oh , no , actually . busy night .

yeah .

see you over there , miles .

oh . huh . well ... congratulations again , vicki . that 's wonderful news .

i 'm pregnant .

universally rejected . strike three .

so what 's happening with your book ?

that 's great .

yeah , he 's good that way . very considerate .

that was big of him .

i 'm going to hang up now , miles .

ken .

oh , miles . you 're drunk .

victoria ! how the hell are you ?

miles ?

hello ?

good stuff .

both .

about four weeks .

huh . jack loves golf . crazy about it .

you golf ?

he had to make a phone call .

anything but the jayer richebourg !

we were thinking . why do n't we go back to my place ? i 've got wine , some insane cheeses , music , whatever .

what 's everyone ordering ? then we can sort out the wine .

well , i 've come to never expect greatness from a cab franc , and this one 's no exception . sort of a flabby , overripe --

i just got divorced . phyllis .

a famous actor who 's getting married next week .

morgan took a sip . it has his amoebas in it .

this one ?

why do you talk to mom when you 're by yourself ?

only for pee or poop .

i saw a monster . can i have a glass of water ?

houdini 's sick .

dad !

listen bo . this is very important . everything people have written about in science books is going to change . the history of the world 's future is on the tv right now . we need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there ... for your children bo .

it tastes funny .

what ? colleen ? ... colleen ?

... i will .

... tell bo to listen to her brother . he 'll always take care of her .

... i will .

good .

i do n't feel much .

it 's called probing . it 's a military procedure . you send a reconnaissance group , very small , to check out things . not to engage , but to evaluate the situation . evaluate the level of danger . make sure things are all clear ...

i see .

i 've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights . ca n't tell what they look like , cause they 're staying in the shadows -- covert like . no one 's got hurt mind you ... and that 's the give away .

you do ?

do n't .

he 's not strong enough to fight off another attack .

i 'm close .

me too .

they 're distracting us ?

we wo n't be able to get out of there .

he was trying to eat a second chocolate bar . your grandma said , `` no . '' he tried to take a bite , so i grabbed it .

should we make a run for it out the back ?

ray reddy 's house .

how can you say that ?

morgan , be careful .

it 's broken morgan . it 'll just keep doing this . let 's get out of the car okay ?

he 's telling you the truth , edgar . whoever it was , is very strong and can jump pretty high .

that roof is over ten feet high .

it was very dark .

no i 'm not .

explain noises .

okay , this guy is trying to scare us . he 's messed with our property , he 's coming around the house . it 's time for an ass whoopin ' !

did someone save me ?

i hope they 're doing better than we are . we do n't even have helmets .

you 're scaring your sister .

stop crying !

what about isabelle ?

where are we going to sleep ?

what do you think about the idea that they do n't like places near water , and we might be safe from them near a lake or something ?

they win .

they said one of two things could happen . one , they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later .

it gets clearer , the higher you hold it .

i 'm getting out now .

it needs batteries .

is he okay ?

you take care of yourself ... graham .

it 's good advice ... say hi to marcia for me .

it 's left its mark still . the last thing these children need to do , is worry about some crazy things happening in the world . take them into town . get their minds -- your mind , on everyday things . it 's good medicine .

six months .

do you owe anybody money ? you can tell me off the record if you need too .

i would say so .

no father , they 're edgy . on alert . like they act when they smell a predator around ... peeing on themselves and everything .

some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior . sometimes violent behavior . theo henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow .

it 's the strangest thing father .

they think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver .

my partner and me robbed the bank in turley and headed out with a posse on our tails . my partner there caught one a ways back , and i think he kicked off while i was looking for this damn canyon . you 're dawson , ai n't you ? i 'm tex larue . used to ride with ry morris . you know him . well , andy sims told me there was a hideout here , so i headed for it . hope you do n't mind .

i think we lost 'em .

jake , i 'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense ?

what friend is that ?

no , no , no ! i winged him , and he dropped his gun .

emmett ! am i glad to see you !

all right then . let 's go .

she was hurt ... pretty bad . emmett , they took the little boy with them .

i almost did n't .

have to .

you 'll never make it .

sure .

yeah ... maybe . so long .

how 's mr. parker doing ?

yeah ... that must have been it .

you do n't make it easy on a fellow .

that 's why i 'm here .

i guess i put a good scare into him .

they 've been kind to me .

more than enough .

and they were two of them . look --

this is where baxter and hawley brung us .

i 'll be long gone .

ten a.m .

i 'm just meeting a guy here and moving on . so far i have n't been able to find him .

you might make a farmer yet .

pleased to meet you , sheriff .

cobb , i want you to meet emmett . he 's a friend of mine . this is sheriff cobb .

then i guess this is where we part ways . sorry .

it never is . but he 's my brother . we 're going to california together . but first we 're going to stop in silverado and see our sister . and i ca n't show up there with a story like this .

it 's not going to be easy .

i hate to see any man swing . bad luck .

he is that .

yup . the whole rig . i do n't care much about the rest , but i surely will miss that bay . least they did n't kill me . that was right considerate , i thought . they were laughing when they left me . thought it was real funny . i walked for a little while but there was no use , so i gave it up . figured it was just bad luck .

looks like that 's not all they admired .

i 've never been in there . they just jumped you out of the blue ?

tomorrow we 're going to town to straighten that out once and for all . the next day we 'll be back here ... farming . and these cattle better be gone .

whose law ? the law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle .

i saw the light . i thought maybe rae had come back to see me . but i never thought it 'd be my boy . i never thought that .

daddy ?

a lot of men have told me that . maybe it 's true . i guess some women are slow to believe it .

never will again .

i do n't believe in luck . i know what conrad was like . do n't tell me what you think i want to hear .

why , j.t. , watch what you 're saying around augie . emmett did n't kill anybody .

oh , a guy who got run out of town ...

what now ?

we did n't get that far .

right !

really ?

there are three strangers in this room , traveller , and these gents you are accusing are n't them . are these your friends ?

this nigger 's breaking up my place , sheriff langston .

we 'll see about that . i 'm sheriff john langston . as you may have guessed , i am not from these parts .

we 'd rather stay .

what makes you think i could ?

get out . we have nothing to talk about .

why are they doing this , mal ?

this is it , gents . my ma told me to head south past that rock .

did you hear his son is still around ?

i heard that too .

things are getting messy around here . i hear ezra johnson got himself killed .

he 's good , all right . too good for my men . that 's why you 've got to take care of it .

he must be pretty good .

maybe you could run it without stella .

i took out thirteen dollars .

maybe we ought to ask stella .

you better get in there with her until this thing is over .

what do you mean ?

give me some of the good stuff .

you really are a gambler .

who 's the owner ?

that 's kelly , my so-called partner . he runs that side .

you like a good saloon ?

i am . i 'm always there , but i only shine at night .

paden .

stella .

the world is what you make of it , friend . if it does n't fit , you make alterations .

nifty .

from what i 've seen , paden does n't care much about money .

i am telling the truth .

exactly . you 're a household name now . you 're moving in entirely different worlds . that 's why i hope you 're not toying with viktor .

damn -- yes -- i -- -- i 'm just a little tired . listen , elaine , viktor and i -- it 's strictly a working relationship . we could never be anything else . we 're just so ... different .

no ... it 's life .

-- you just got lucky that she 's loyal enough to stay with you . maybe she 's staying out of pity , who knows ? she certainly does n't need you . some people even say you 're holding her back .

every actor is an invention , viktor . do n't embarrass yourself . no one 's denying that you discovered simone . but it 's like finding a diamond in the desert . anyone can trip over it , but it 's not the finder who sparkles .

not if i do n't let her .

no . she 'll never work again -- retire , never make a movie or a record , or appear ever again .

no , there is n't . there 's nothing to her .

-- and she was positively glowing at the awards . i should be going , she 'll be here soon --

i know . i know . they 'll say anything .

about now . would you like a drink ?

elaine , it 's wednesday .

i can imagine .

i do ?

i 'd love to . but are n't you supposed to meet up with simone ?

oh , make it live -- please , viktor .

you 're so good to protect her like this .

you really think so ?

viktor , i have a feeling . one of my feelings . there 's something about her i do n't trust .

simone does not control my destiny .

which accounts for your percentage . when do i get to meet this dream ?

well , shoot it on the last day .

well , we have to do something about this -- `` stuntwoman '' .

she 'll do her own . theater training .

hair and make-up ?

there are n't any . if the filmmakers are happy , simone 's happy . she considers herself an ... `` instrument '' .

no problem . do you want to come in ?

why is n't she with you ?

good to see you too , elaine .

where is she ?

even if you find her , you know the problem with unknowns , viktor . if they 're good , they get known . and then you 're back to sorting their candy ... and worse . i 'm sorry , viktor .

i 'm not taking away your daughter , just your deal . you and i both know , after the divorce i kept you on for old time 's sake , so you could still hold your head up in front of lainey . i called what 's his name at warner 's . he said he 'd take a meeting -- in july . i 've fought for you viktor ... you want to talk severance ?

how can i ? your last three pictures tanked . the board is giving me hell . no bankable star will work with you after this . if you just compromised ... a little .

you 're not renewing my contract .

spare me .

not just any mike & ike 's -- cherry mike & ike 's . do you know why i , viktor taransky , two-time academy award nominated director --

difficult . i 'm difficult .

yes -- oh my , god . is that you , simone ? ! i 've been wanting to talk to you .

hello , is this elaine ?

lainey , there 's no evidence that simone is n't real .

i mean really meet her -- in the flesh .

sometimes . but , just when i think your father 's changing for the better , i realize he 's as self absorbed as ever . he took the credit for simone tonight .

obviously , this ca n't last . she 's going to dump him . viktor wo n't be able to take that . he 's too sensitive . it 'll destroy him .

do what you do to simone .

i do find myself physically attracted to you , mr. taransky .

yes , of course , but very beautiful in your own right .

of course .

thank god for you , faith . i know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in . you do n't know what a service you 're performing for simone -- shielding her from those animals .

-- simone , the question on everyone 's mind is simply ... `` why ? ''

i suppose the thing i like most about the movies i 'm in is that they 're not about special effects .

nudity has just never been an issue for me , frank . for me , clothes are just an option .

absolutely not !

for her ?

you 'll never guess who i 'm with ... you ran into him on the lot .

listen , hank , it 's been a rough day . i 'll call you about his next week .

what 's that ?

i do n't know anything about computers .

i have your new leading lady ... ... right here in my pants .

i was misquoted .

we 've been seeing each other , sure , but we 'd rather keep our relationship private .

me and simone . what i did .

the old viktor taransky . i liked you better before -- before all this . you were a loser , dad , but at least you had integrity . i ca n't stand to see you like this -- clinging to simone 's coattails -- it used to be about the work , and now it 's all about her . and then she 's not even grateful enough to thank you .

it 's from both of us . of course you 'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --

it 's the car she drove in `` eternity forever '' .

she did ... did n't she ?

i love you , lainey .

i 'll see what i can do . you know , lainey . i do n't believe you 've ever once asked to meet simone . do n't you like her ?

really ? too bad .

so that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six ?

i know , hal is as stiff as always .

i 'm sure you 'd tell me if you thought it was important .

you understood them . that 's what was amazing . it 's a nice day . let 's eat outside .

you do ? still ? i ca n't tell you how happy i am to hear that .

is she here tonight ?

you know , i ... do n't know .

you look very grown up . what are you doing ? you meeting your mom for dinner ?

hi , dad .

what ? !

i did n't kill anyone , bernard , there was no one to kill !

you certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood . you 've killed an icon , for god 's sake .

that does n't prove a thing -- wait until i get a court order for a blood test .

she looks a lot like you .

alright , sayer , you 've got a deal .

i want to see her . unless you show me simone live and in person i show these pictures to the authorities .

abduction ?

-- i 've looked at every piece of publicity she 's ever done , the video in the supermarket , there 's no evidence she 's ever left the studio . oh , and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail . but i have `` obtained '' a copy of your bank accounts . i know you have power of attorney but so far you have n't transferred one single solitary cent to her .

i 've done my homework . i 've studied her .

maybe the reason she 's with me is a little thing called integrity , sayer . look it up .

could they have built that hotel since yesterday ?

i do n't understand .

sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth . as for a photo -- if you ca n't do it , i know twelve million people who can .

long live the first amendment .

my god , you 've got one ?

obviously the name is n't real -- she 's using an assumed identity , travels under a false name , checks into hotels with an alias . she never stays in the same place two nights in a row . anything on the satellite photos ? what about the fingerprints ? what happened when we dusted that hotel suite ?

shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes , every concierge and maitre d ' on the take . but this simone woman is good .

24-hour tail on taransky ?

we 've got our best people on it , mr. sayer .

yes , very .

would you like me to read ?

thank you . it 's not important .

it 's the biggest on earth ! i swear ! it 's a 50-foot airstream -- they do n't make them any longer than that .

-- nicola ! how was your massage ?

is miss simone coming today ?

i certainly am , mr. taransky .

i 'll do anything to please you , mr. taransky .

why do you have to bring that up ? there 's always risk -- life 's a risk . it 's worth it . besides , how could something so lovely be a crime ? well , i think we 've done enough for today . you 've been cooped up in there too long . how about you and me go out on the town ? they 're expecting us .

i was hoping you 'd say that .

yes . yes , i 'm going to tell the truth about you , why would n't i ... ? of course , with hank 's tragic passing , the secret died with him . i am going to tell the truth ... after your next picture .

you 're right . you 're right . of course , one does n't want to boast . it 's a classic case of technology in search of an artist . that 's all you 've been waiting for , an artist with integrity , with a vision , who can see .

you did create me .

yes . yes , it is .

buy it ? they 're paying for it . and around here that 's how you really know they buy it .

i did n't leave you .

what ? you do n't see enough of me at the store ?

wow . they called you their son .

three ? we should hock it . buy a c.d . rack for the bedroom .

on my way to the flea market in amish country . thought maybe you want to come . show me how to buy at these things .

what ?

i definitely wo n't .

where will you go , where no one has died ?

what if they do n't want help ? what if they 're just angry and they want to hurt somebody ?

just help .

it 's spanish . it means ... ' i do n't want to die . ' not all the ghosts are scary , are they ? like mrs. marschal ?

maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in ... and then all of a sudden , it 's all taken away . no one asked them . it 's just gone ...

you really look better .

you were n't a paper champion .

when ?

i do n't know , cole .

can i ask you then ?

and the tiny hairs on your arm . are they all standing up ?

yes ?

i know every child is special in their own way , but tommy sounds like a punk . i thought the play was excellent . better than cats .

... no .

how often do you see them ?

dead people , like in graves and coffins ?

me too .

what ?

upset words .

words .

you hate him ?

you saw that on t.v. , cole ?

if it 's okay with you ?

not even little ones that are n't supposed to hurt ?

oh , lots of things , i suppose . bad people for one . people who wanted to imprison them . hurt them .

what were they hiding from ?

i knew there was a sound explanation .

they 're my dad 's . the lenses hurt my eyes .

she wanted me to tell you --

grandma comes to visit me sometimes .

where is she ?

yes .

oh my god .

yeah .

i 'm ready to communicate with you now .

i 'd give anything to have been there .

so who moved it ?

did you move the bumble bee pendant ?

sometimes people think they lose things and they did n't really lose them . it just gets moved .

you 'd cry . cause you miss grandma so much .

how did you -- ?

you should n't laugh at people . it makes them feel bad .

you 're a stuttering stanley !

like what ?

cole , this was a legal courthouse . laws were passed here . some of the first laws of this country . this building was full of lawyers . lawmakers .

i wish i could be like my momma though . she always knew what was wrong . knew just what to say .

good for you .

you ever hear of ... the harvest of blood ?

your pa 's waiting for you up at the house .

okay , farm boy . joke 's over . you 've been playin ' me from jump street . where 's my nikes ?

hi suze .

`` and a slash-slash there -- ''

`` old macdonald ... had -- ''

metaphysical question , man .

sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before i rolled it .

are you crazy ?

shotgun . suicide . next ?

curt cobain .

-- it 's not me !

that 's a good idea . maybe we should have a little `` talk '' about grandaddy jethro .

i do n't think so .

she was talking about ... a `` harvest of blood '' ...

you got it wrong , boy . i 'm not the monster you think .

this is his room ... is n't it ?

that old barn . after the fire ... i rebuilt it nail by nail . just the way your granddaddy would 've wanted it .

joseph macdonald . damn right , boy . and do n't you forget it .

ai n't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years . my boy was taken from me ... far as i 'm concerned , he 's dead . now , i ai n't gon na ask you again . -- who are you ? !

i 'm your son . and laureen 's son .

ray -- i 'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn .

hey -- macdonald 's farm !

not while you 're driving .

it 's a farm , keith . you 're not supposed to shoot the rooster .

hey . some klu klux klan homeboy gets in my face , he gon na have a few extra holes in his bedsheet .

hey . could you be a little more insensitive ? we 're on our way to a funeral for crissake .

chicken sandwich ?

you guys figure it out . i 'm taking a break .

yeah . that 's just the problem .

relax . he liked what he saw . well , some of it . enough to give us a showcase audition . one week from today .

do n't you see ? whatever 's going on ... i 'm part of it .

do n't look .

suzie --

you never had trouble communicating before .

you would n't understand .

i 'm talking to the spirit of jethro macdonald . is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson ? we 'll be careful of the bed --

this ... used to be jethro 's room . the attic .

what about jeremiah ?

my father and i do n't exactly see eye to eye .

what 'll we do ?

hold it , hold it . are n't you forgetting something , rod ?

spider .

i was getting 'warmed ' up .

i know what people say , bill . i ... remember , back in high school i worked at my father 's gas station ?

maybe she 's ever called the house , or -- ?

there 's a place over there on the bluffs . when the fog is just right , like tonight , the lights of main look like a kaleidoscope .

i do n't know . i 've seen them so many times before . i guess any spot gets boring after awhile .

pretty , ai n't they ?

just checking out the lights .

what the fuck they gon na do with her in a hospital , bill ?

what do you see ? i see a butterfly .

some kids found her necklace near tipper creek , as well as what might be her blood on a rock .

i ca n't hear when you 're nodding .

enough to get to jersey . i 'll walk the rest of the way . i 've been sitting a long time . nice meeting you . it 's been a trip .

i do n't know . we were planning on seeing the astrodome .

i do n't know . maybe jerry jeff sent the heat after us .

they 're both a challenge .

having fun .

why are you doing this obviously macho feat ?

you sure do .

yes .

i 'm working , bandit . besides , what 's the matter ? wo n't your new girl friend help you ?

another time .

sure i ca n't interest you in anything else ?

you 're coming up to the scale house .

talk to me .

roger . keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down . right , fred ?

it should n't last . gives me time to take a go-go juice break .

bandit two , i got ta make a quick pit stop .

nope . just keep those wheels churning .

we 're gone .

do i have a choice ?

yeah , guy ?

she 's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we 're never gon na make it . might i remind you this was your brainstorm .

what does the old timex say ?

not for long , you ai n't .

what 's going on , bandit ? come on .

you ca n't swear on these .

clear and rolling .

i hate to say i told you so .

right . give me your pen . we 'll tell 'em to bill kyle .

let 's get the hell outta here .

redneck heaven .

liquid gold .

he 's history .

i 'm gon na run a couple miles ahead of you . keep both feet on the floor . we 'll be moving ninety and over .

you 're wall to wall and tree top tall .

we got ta let the slack out , cledus ; this is costing us time .

no .

you know of course , we ai n't ever gon na make it .

how 'd you know ?

my handle 's smokey bear and i got you by the tail .

go breaker .

some boy named bandit 's been givin ' the highway patrol shit fits .

i 'll keep my eyeballs peeled .

listen , pardner ; this ai n't no time to be getting laid .

that crazy sumbitch made it .

oh .

why do n't we just rent a lear jet and haul it back ourselves ?

i still think this whole idea is dumb , pop .

-- yeah , i heard . but they wo n't hold him for long . anyway , he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money .

-- breaker , this is banana peel ...

and who has access to that floor ?

-- so you shut them off ?

yeah . have you been able to get through to the nomad 's security ?

deputy , have you made any id 's ?

he 's giving them up ?

no . and i want to be in that room a half second after mecklen calls to say the deal 's done . we 've got a sheriff 's task force on stand-by .

well ... this is as good a place for it as any i guess .

and when you saw him later , he was wearing one of your security jackets --

yeah , he had the badge and everything . it said `` fbi '' on it .

-- run both those names through the d.c. database . call san francisco , see if they 've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --

two of 'em ?

and this is your car , is n't it ?

pretty much , yep .

i did . we -- yeah , i know .

i 'm glad i 'm here . i love it . i 'm gon na get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with jesus and them .

i do n't mind now anyway . you know , up here in heaven , it 's beautiful . way better than fuckin ' hawaii or any place like that .

you woulda ?

if i needed your i.d . and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law , i woulda killed you to get 'em too .

i sent hugo , he should be there !

-- fine , fuck , i got it ... lake tahoe , nevada . i 'll have hugo book your flight , you can be here in a couple hours . he 'll meet you at the airport .

wo n't work , we 're just gon na have to chance it man . i 'm sorry .

yeah , why .

then what --

his law firm , same one that hired me . israel walked out after he made bail and nobody 's seen him since .

that 's right ! right now !

... i 'm sorry ...

only if you really , truly mean it .

i know you left him a message . what did you say !

i left him a message .

d'you talk to 'm ?

fuck you !

y'ai n't never had to wash another man 's blood off , dig it out y'fingernails ... y'had us for that . y'ai n't ever made a real beef on y'own , shit as light in the ass as you are , i 'll bet you ai n't ever made anything more than a fuck ' n fist your whole life . so if you think i'mma let your lil ' punk-ass , with the dirt i 've done for you , in the eleventh hour , sell me off like some fucking field nigger , hand me up to the feds like y'last chip , then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking mind !

that 's probably him now ...

we 're hot , and they 're losing a whole floor 's worth of business saying it 's `` under construction . ''

the deputy director , this prick locke , he smashed the whole thing , we 're done , they wo n't tell me why ...

-- and you 're gon na feel altogether fucked , by me , if you do n't handle this . i 'm the one , does the face plant , this falls apart , not you .

you 're trying to save sparazza ?

but you did , and have ... and now people are dead . did sparazza become more valuable than israel ... and did you make another deal ?

i would n't go that far .

... yeah , fifty-three .

... are you insane ?

-- brought against sparazza by israel 's mother laverne who was nineteen at the time . they had a brief affair which israel was the by- product of .

... a paternity suit , filed 1967 ...

-- will be handled back in --

possibly . acosta is pure mercenary . and a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies . but forget about sparazza 's money for a moment and remember , there 's no shortage of those who want israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that ...

i thought heller was a double op ?

bag this fucker buzzy .

so how we lookin ' ?

well just so i got a quote in my head . what 's the rate for the swede ?

yeah , i can front this .

no question , no , you 're right . we got ta do what 's good for us now .

-- he 's doing it then , huh --

i 'm here .

-- okay ... hang on , i got ta move --

nah , nuthin ' on my end --

i probably woulda busted on you too ... and what a shame that woulda been .

like a mafucka .

it 's going around ai n't it ? mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch . i think i accidentally shot and killed my boy today .

my mamma ? c'mon shorty , y' got ta ask ? you hurtin ' pretty bad ?

-- good , then all you got to be is grateful .

girl one of these fools has an fbi badge on him ! is this the one that was doing the inspection ?

c'mon , i say we bounce now , kick it for a lil ' bit , play some craps . ... maybe spend the night ?

not you . some assholes on the elevator ... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what ? why the fuck they call 'm `` working girls . ''

-- i do n't know , i feel like you always pushin ' up on me , gettin ' close and i love you baby , in every way you can love a bitch , 'cept that one .

i ai n't tryin ' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga .

... girl , y'know i had to bring big mamma through .

no ? who am i , then ?

you 'll end up like me .

it can . ordinary matter , like ours ? not affected . everything else , disintegrates .

you think you 're dreaming me , like you dream her . understand something : i am the real gibarian . just a new incarnation .

no , she wo n't .

she reappeared exactly as she had before ?

we 're done . oh , i should tell you , i do n't trust snow . there 's something wrong with him .

the same thing that could happen to any of us .

who , here , could possibly care what you want ? at best , you 're employee of the month for the highest bidder in the solaris auction . they have no idea what 's going on up here . they 've never even been in space . and i 'm supposed to listen to you ?

i want to hear your version .

maybe you can .

i wo n't be making the trip .

into what ?

just get him to stop .

what do you want ?

that 's right . and we all have to sleep , eventually .

they come when you sleep .

no .

when you cut yourself pounding the door , did it hurt ?

why ?

personally , i think it 's god . at least , it fits my definition .

what was it ?

oh , that 's a relief .

she was real . where did she come from ?

is there anybody else here ?

i ca n't talk just now . i 'm too tired .

i love chocolate . i realized just yesterday how much i love it . i thought maybe , if they let you bring personal effects , you might have snuck some through , because ... well , i 've been thinking about it .

he 's dead .

you must have been dreaming .

when ?

what does it want ?

i wish you would n't .

is that really what you want ?

yes , you are --

i ... i am rheya . but i am not the woman you loved ten years ago .

who are you , then ?

then you 'll die .

no .

i 'm disgusting .

do n't call me that .

how could it be so cruel ? how could it torture us like this ?

what 's happening to us ?

he is . but he was here ...

gibarian . he was here .

rheya .

i do n't think do . it 's not sleep ; it 's something else . it 's all around me .

was she right ?

you do n't love me .

you know , i 've decided : i 'm just gon na believe what you believe about this whole solaris thing , it 'll make life so much easier ; the little wife agreeing with her big , strong husband . you must get such a headache thinking about those great big problems all day .

i know . i know . we do n't have to talk about that .

how old were you ?

what happened ?

as i said , then it 's god , right ?

is it intelligent ?

yes . but not until you mentioned them . as soon as you said those things , i remembered them . and they have associations that make me think of other things i remember . it 's like filling up .

i am . please come with me . i do n't want to do this here .

you go home .

let 's go home .

you did n't look very happy .

poem . dylan thomas . i thought of it when i saw you on the train .

`` and death shall have no dominion '' .

do n't .

i 'll go with you .

i 'm not snow .

and when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the ... original , the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness .

they are not autonomous individuals and they 're not actual persons . they are projections materializing from our minds , based on a given individual .

we thought you 'd be alone . we want to talk about ...

he wo n't .

it 's terrific win .

you still going away ?

long enough .

i 'd miss my life ...

they guys treatin ' you all right ?

do you ?

what a memory .

claire ...

listen , you 're right . do n't do it . i 'll just ... send you an address , okay ?

this is me , mike . there 's nothing else ...

i do n't know you ...

she 's okay . everything 's okay ...

they called here after you left ...

i do care about you !

stop being nuts !

stop , will you ? !

you told me i 'm safe ? i 'm going for a walk in the park .

no , you 'll be safe . we 're gon na pick him up again ...

you put me life in danger .

i 'll miss you , mike ...

what 's to like ?

but `` nice '' .

i saw you with a dog , in my mind .

that 's nice . and you live in queens ? with a child , and a dog ... ?

and `` is '' ... ?

you know why they 're like that ... ? he was myopic ... going blind .

did n't do very well , did you ?

big talk ... desperate guy .

i guess i 'm supposed to do it in the morning . identify him .

hi . just checking to see if you 're here .

let 's get a drink .

hey ! there are crazy people here .

people think i 'm stepping out on neil . we 're causing quite a scandal .

would you pick one out , please ?

my father founded a music school there . the milton gregory school .

do you have another tie ? something more conservative ?

i 'm supposed to call in .

can we go then ?

right . that 's true .

uh ...

hard to find doors in this place .

just putting in an appearance then .

what am i supposed to do ? ! i saw one of my oldest friends get killed ! and i saw who did it ! i ca n't just -- `` let it go away '' ! !

... i do n't want to talk about it ...

... just saying you should think twice about it ...

tommy ... !

the gun ? it 's in the upstairs closet .

i 'm all right .

was it venza ? did you get him ?

i 'm going to visit my sister for a few days . i 'd like you to get your stuff out .

el ? i 'm sorry . i do love you . and you are a lady . i have so much respect ...

get away from me ... get away ! she means that much to you , you stay with her . but you come back , you come back for me . not for tommy , not for your mother , or your fucking job , but for me .

i 'd like you to switch to the day shift , mike . to be home for dinner . helen insists that t.j. be home for dinner ... that 's why he 's on the morning shift .

i do n't remember michael , go to sleep . you do n't have to make conversation with me .

you got ta get another tour . we 're gettin ' too old for this .

jesus , mike , somebody 's been feeding you a line of crap .

did you hear what i said ?

coming to bed ?

i think -- she 's crazy .

i do n't know that ellie . he might get out . garber 's not bein ' straight with the witness , she could be in deep shit if she identifies him , and it 's my job to convince her she wo n't be .

what shit , honey ?

okay ?

it 's twenty bucks in the bank .

just keep it someplace safe , but handy .

so how 'd it go ?

get in bed .

my ass is falling . it is .

i heard a lot ... anything you want to deny , mike ?

you apprehended him after he gave himself up --

discourage it . but stay with her if you ca n't . call it in first so we can have a car on tail . she 's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine ... okay , let 's check it out .

i do n't know how you did it , but whatever it was , keep doing it .

we 'll call swat . we 'll get the locals . throw it !

koontz ! i need you guys !

at my house ... !

it was my fault , t.j. fuck !

bad fuckin ' news . even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands . but he knows where a lot of bodies are buried . it 'd cap it for garber if he could bring him in .

who 's joey venza ?

... hard ?

she 's not a suspect , sir , she 's a witness . could i ask you to step outside , please .

do n't tell me he 's `` busy '' . i asked for an ambulance for this woman and ...

i asked for the man in charge ...

no , sir ...

under the table .

do n't you fuckin ' give orders to me ...

i get my hostage first . no one 's turned loose until i say so .

hold it ... !

yeah . she says we got ta get used to being alone in this neighborhood . 'bye , dad .

shooting .

we 're gon na pass the street .

what ! what kind of pathetic line is that ?

she met some friend of aunt millie 's who works for a record company . he thinks she 's got a great voice .

she 's taking singing lessons .

what `` plans ? '' you and mom got `` plans ? ''

lay back , mack .

and flash is n't ?

sexual tension ...

oh , come on , ben , that 's not --

no , no .

cause if you get in a bind --

hm . what a lump .

i saw him too . he was silly and obnoxious .

i was sort of hoping to get out of --

well , i 've missed a lot of classes myself ...

oh , i need your notes from the classes i missed .

listen , i do appreciate your concern , but --

do n't be pitiful .

harry !

what 's in there ?

right .

you can be great , kid , just stick with it . but let me give you one little piece of advice ... be a good guy .

ca n't focus ...

hmf-hrr ?

frmpph-yrr .

police , help ! po -- mmph .

i do n't submit to blackmail ! the first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as i imagine it , and --

two suits by tomorrow for $ 400 ?

are you quite finished ?

well ...

is that bug juice , or are you just glad to see me ?

even if you 've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written .

even if they 're not clever .

some things you should say anyway .

i do n't think he wants me to find him .

nah .

this may be the end of a beautiful friendship , you know .

hold it . can we stop being clever , just for a moment ?

peter ?

unh-huh . excuse me . i 've got ta go .

you 'd feel what ?

what 's in the bag ? garbage ?

that was n't clever . that was just nasty .

i 'm sure you kept warm .

oh . maybe i should , too --

what are you doing this weekend ?

hurry up , flash !

does it have a human name ?

you should write that one down .

but you like that in a man ?

poor harry . always desperate for attention . what about the bunny ?

i hate --

i lov-loathe elizabeth allan . abhor , detest , despise --

uh is a good start .

how very dull , peter parker .

yeah , roz .

no such thing as coincidence . `` god does not play dice with the universe . ''

it 's a lot of ground to cover . we 'll try . funny coincidence , huh ?

of course .

you were the last one to see thorkel . in octavius ' hospital room .

it 's fine . tell me what --

funny thing happened after my physics class today . harry osborn --

absolutely no class .

it 'll shut itself off .

anyway , i 've decided to kidnap you for dinner in forest hills --

ick . and those foul chemicals in the pots --

poison emergency .

that nobel prize will just have to wait .

i do n't care . cretin .

this is the unified field ! all the forces of the universe tied together -- perfectly !

i 've had an extremely bad day , octavius . a sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures .

you have no right ! this is cosmic suicide !

life and death matter . yours -- everyone 's . by comparison , our search for truth is only a product of curiosity , a game --

no . no thank you . i have work .

if you really apply yourself , you 'll get an a next time .

you never know . go get some sleep .

caused by doc ock 's experiment ?

your dog ate it .

i was hoping you 'd call , babe . look , you got representation ?

oh -- i do n't know -- thanks , mr. reiss , but --

i just gave -- yeah , sure .

okay , kid . call me tomorrow .

where 'd you get the clown suit ?

bonkers .

i listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the bhagavad gita , the indian holy book -- `` i am become shiva , death -- the destroyer of worlds . '' octavius was ...

a messianic complex is nothing new to octavius . in his universe , there 's only one mind -- his own . it must be very lonely .

excuse me if i 'm impertinent , but -- how did you become whatever it is you are ?

yeah , just a lung full of new jersey . lucky you showed up when you did .

you must have shot off your mouth all the way from frankfurt to here .

they may . that 's why i would keep my mouth shut .

then we shall all zalute feldwebel von und zu schulz ! about face !

jawohl !

jawohl .

is you all good nazis ?

he 's still in the kommandant 's office . that 's all i know .

any news on dunbar ?

roger .

static !

yeah . security .

why not ? just one of the boys . sharing our bunks . eating our chow . right in amongst the ones that beat me up . except that he beat hardest .

that 'll do .

brother , were we all wet about you !

here 's the knife to do it with . only make sure you got the right throat .

take it .

a little something what ?

and maybe a little something else ?

i grease the kraut guards . with ten percent of the take .

that 's right .

you would , would you ? listen , stupe -- the first week i was in this joint somebody stole my red cross package , my blanket and my left shoe . well , i wised up since . this ai n't no salvation army -- this is everybody for himself . dog eat dog .

hold it , sefton . so we heard some shots -- so who says they did n't get away ?

there 'll be no vigilante stuff . not while i 'm barrack chief .

break it off !

you betcha . i said one of us is a stoolie . a dirty , stinkin ' stoolie !

okay , security -- what happened ?

do n't ask me . price was elected security .

you are talking crazy !

that 's the general idea . only it 's not so general as far as i 'm concerned .

cut out the guff , schulz . we 're on to you . you know everything that 's happening in this barrack . who 's tipping you off ?

such nice boys ! it makes me sick to --

what did you expect , a st. bernard dog ?

my legs are frozen .

they 've got a summer house in nantucket , with an upstairs polo field . you better put a canopy over his bunk .

how could i have had a time bomb ? they searched me when they took me prisoner .

i did n't do it . i did n't do it .

no bother . i 'm very grateful for a little company . you see , i suffer from insomnia .

of course you do n't . now , lieutenant , how would you like to join me in my quarters ? i have a nice fire going .

quite a transportation jam we are having outside of frankfurt ! they are very angry in berlin . they will be even angrier on the east front , waiting for that ammunition train . do n't you think so , lieutenant ?

i am lieutenant dunbar .

very well . if you insist on details . i have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb . good day , sir . you will forgive me for receiving you like this ?

is n't it ?

interesting .

all i know is he did it . i am satisfied .

whatever it is , it 's out of your jurisdiction . this man is not a prisoner of war . not any more . he is a saboteur .

why do n't we accept , animal ? the worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades .

hey , schulz ! i got a deal for you . suppose you help us escape . we 'll go home and have everything ready for you in madison square garden . for the world championship ! schulz , the beast of bavaria versus halitosis jones !

jawohl !

let me do it , hoffy .

betty ! betty !

but it 's not just those legs . it 's that nose of yours i 'm crazy about . that cute little button of a nose !

may i have this dance , miss ?

there 's a time in every man 's life when he wants to be alone ! so go away !

i 'll open mine , too .

why do n't we just look in those footlockers ?

sugar-lips shapiro ! frightening , ai n't it ?

so it is from the finance company . so it 's better than no letter at all . so they want the third payment on the plymouth . so they want the fourth , the fifth , the sixth and the seventh . so they want the plymouth .

harry -- i 'm blind !

schnickelfritz ! i told you schnickelfritz ! why 'd you make me bet on equipoise !

he do n't have to worry . he 'll trade the krauts for a six-burner gas range . maybe a deep freeze too .

where 'd that come from ?

betty grable !

no you do n't ! you do n't want any broads with boots on !

who wants to eat ? i just wan na get over there !

they 'll shoot you , animal !

let me go ! let me go !

lay off ! the blonde is mine !

hey -- comrade ! over here ! this is harry shapiro -- the volga boatman of barrack four !

i said say it again . i did n't say repeat it .

i 'm telling you , animal -- these nazis ai n't ko --

you can say that again !

let go , animal ! it 's roll call ! hitler wants to see you !

maybe they were layin ' for 'em out there !

... a lieutenant james dunbar ?

as the duly elected compound chief , i protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud .

i still say this is my tag . any objections , hoffy ?

maybe it 's crazy , but it 's better than having dunbar dead .

wait a second , hoffy . schulz says he 's our best friend . maybe he can give us a little hint .

you 're wasting your time , duke . outside , everybody ! let 's get it over with .

take some men and get the antenna going . let 's see if we can catch the bbc .

the one you are hiding in the barrack , do n't you know ? the one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound .

yeah ? how would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane ? c'mon joey -- do n't be afraid .

lay off , schulz . he 's got a sickness . he 's krank .

i told you boys i 'm no escape artist , but for the first time , i like the odds . because now i got me a decoy .

you taking dunbar ?

go on .

uh-huh . fell right on my head . sprechen sie deutsch ?

how do they know ?

anybody cover ?

there better not be anything missing . this is private property .

borscht ?

what 's the big idea , sefton ? take that telescope out of here .

just one question . did you calculate the risk ?

today 's camp news ! father murray announces that due to local regulations the christmas midnight mass will be held at seven in the morning !

six o'clock . i was having dinner .

will you get this guy out of my hair so i can go ?

thirty-fifth .

i thought that 's what you said . you 're from cleveland . and you were with the thirty-sixth bomb group ?

so was the radio private property . so was manfredi and johnson .

when the krauts find that gadget they 'll throw us all in the boob .

and what 's that crack supposed to mean ?

nun ? was ist ? haben sie 's herausgefunden ?

give me the radio .

you are trying to say that an american would inform on other americans ?

suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency ?

not particularly .

talk what ? i do not know anything !

you 'd better talk , schulz , because i 'm going to find out with you or without you . because i wo n't let go for a second . because they 'll have to kill me to stop me . so talk !

wunderbar ! maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife . but there is a piano teacher in the village --

you americans ! you are the craziest people ! that 's why i like you ! i wish i could invite you all to my house for a nice german christmas !

look at them , lieutenant . everybody is a clown ! how do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns ?

who 's the other wrestler ? the one with the mustache ?

this is me in cincinnati .

always joking . always making wisecrackers !

come on , let 's get that mail . anything for stanislaus kuzawa ?

a chicken ?

full disruptors .

then when is he going to engineering ?

where is he ?

yes , well , congratulations , ensign . it would n't be the enterprise without a sulu at the helm .

but that was n't so long ago . it could n't have been more than ...

i have to find a way to get to soran .

commander .

yes , sir . there are two in the veridian system .

i believe so .

it will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information .

i believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays .

i am sorry , but i can not stop myself . i think something is wrong

i know . i just got it . it was very funny .

really ? what do you feel ?

that is true . however , i believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse . for thirty-four years i have endeavored to become more `` human '' - to grow beyond my original programming . and yet i am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor . this emotion chip is the only answer .

perhaps . yes ! if we sent a low-level ionic pulse , it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems .

we all are , data . but we 're going to get him back .

there 's some buckling on the starboard nacelle . we 've also got a hull breach in the engineering section . emergency forcefields are in place and holding .

you did it , kirk ! damage report , ensign .

deck 15 , section 21-alpha .

on screen .

signal the closest starship . we 're in no condition to mount a rescue . we do n't even have a full crew aboard .

i know exactly where i want to go , and when . back to that mountaintop on veridian iii , before soran put out the star . i have to stop him .

i told you , time has no meaning here . if you leave , you can go anywhere , any time .

yes , where would you go ?

guinan , can i leave the nexus ?

left behind ?

guinan , what 's going on ? where am i ?

it took a long time , but eventually i learned to live with it . and i began to realize that my experience in the nexus had changed me . i knew things about people , about events , about time .

soran does n't care about power or weapons . all he cares about is getting back to the nexus .

excuse me , gentlemen , if you 'll take your seats .

well , may we have a look around ?

least i could do for a captain of the enterprise .

she 's not real either , is she ? nothing here is . nothing here matters .

this is my uncle 's barn in iowa .

i do n't need to be lectured by you . i was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers . and frankly , i think the galaxy owes me one i was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that i could n't see anything past this uniform . and in the end , what did it get me ? nothing . not this time .

you said history considers me dead . who am i to argue with history ?

not exactly . as i said , this is some kind of-

i 'm from what you would consider the future ; the 24th-century .

this clock , i gave this clock to bones .

kirk here .

the first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death . scotty ?

sulu . when did he find the time for a family ?

you know , scotty , it amazes me .

what do you mean , you 're not going ? we promised .

i 'm not going scotty , help me with this chute .

oh

oh , i forgot to tell you . while you were unconscious , i injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream . it 's been navigating your cardiovascular system , and right now i 've attached it to your left ventricle . a little trick i picked up from the borg .

guinan ? i do n't know what you 're talking about .

normal is what everyone else is , and what you are not .

i always thought i 'd have a crack at this chair one day .

that 's a pretty big margin of error .

they 're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old klingon bird of prey is any match for the federation flagship .

maybe they 're not out there .

report .

no , sir .

hmm , inform starfleet command . this could indicate a new romulan threat in this sector .

aye , aye , sir . take the wheel , commander .

well , now that we 're all aboard=8a number one , bring the ship before the wind . let 's see what 's out there .

when we went to ancient rome for deanna 's promotion , we threw her to the lions , remember ?

do n't you think you 're taking this a little too far , number one ?

or perhaps they 're on the surface .

your family history is very important to you , is n't it ?

all right , all right . you 've made your point .

very well . i suppose i could make out my weekly report to starfleet command without your input . `` admiral lusby , regarding the unusual behavior of jean-luc picard : i find him increasingly irritable , remote and uncooperative . i recommend forced shore leave at a starbase facility in order to- ''

i 'm afraid i ca n't just leave it at that . the commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something . as ship 's counselor , it 's my duty to-

actually , i 'm here to see if there 's anything i can do for you .

the nexus .

the only possible reason you 're here is because you 're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all . so you 've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan . good luck .

the thought had crossed my mind .

doctor , we 're still conducting an investigation into the attack . once we 've completed our work , we 'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory . until then-

yes , yes , captain . thank you for coming .

we 're only going to get one shot at this . target their primary reactor . with any luck , their warp core should implode .

aye , sir .

worf , prepare a spread of photon torpedoes . we 'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak .

as their cloak begins to engage , their shields will drop .

i have spoken to the klingon high council , sir . they identified the bird of prey as belonging to the duras sisters .

sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago .

have geordi and data go over with the next away team . tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium .

why were they looking for it on a federation observatory ? it does n't make any sense .

it looks like we 're too late .

you see the top yardarm , now look to the-

the royal ... studs ?

and we are gaining ... stand by , tractor beam !

he has been here for some time . i can feel his presence .

for an instant ... a scout class vessel .

what did you see , chekov ?

bones ... can you give me a quadrant bi-scan ?

aye , sir .

response ?

sir , starfleet calling grissom again . a warning about us .

mr. scott , we need everything you 've got now .

shall i alert dr. mccoy ?

locate .

wait a minute ... ! we do n't know what we 're talking about here ...

thank you ... < u > sir < /u > !

not from here , no .

oh no you do n't ! regulations specifically state : `` nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated . '' can you guarantee that ?

david , i do n't understand ...

no ! ... i 'll do it . give me your phaser .

pon farr . vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life .

days ... maybe hours ... protomatter has made the situation unpredictable . i 'm sorry .

protomatter . an unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable .

i used protomatter in the genesis matrix .

why ?

not exactly .

but ... how could they have evolved so quickly ... ?

captain , please -- we 'll take the risk . we 've < u > got < /u > to find out what it is ...

underground deposit ?

this is where the fun begins , saavik !

saavik ... does dr. marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination ?

yes , saavik , go ahead ...

very well . exercise caution , lieutenant . this landing is captain 's discretion and i 'm the one who 's out on a limb .

you said there would n't be any .

if equipment is functioning properly , indications are -- an animal life form .

bones , help spock ! everyone else , find a station !

how many more ?

they 've knocked out the damn automation center . i 've got no control over anything !

mr. scott : two photon torpedoes at the ready . sight on the center of the mass .

i 'd be grateful , admiral , if you 'd give the word .

your reputation is secure , scotty . mr. sulu , take the con . i 'll be in my quarters .

your timing is excellent , mr. scott . you 've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home . how much refit time till we can take her out again ?

my god ...

the katra ritual is meant to deposit spock 's consciousness in the hall of ancient thought - not in his body .

yes , he is . and someone else . vulcan scientist of your acquaintance .

why would you do this ... ?

i know you ... do i not ?

we are clear and free to navigate .

come on !

close ... there --

with some on the planet ...

about a dozen officers and men .

fire , mr. scott !

that distortion is closing rapidly ... opinion , sulu ?

yes , sir . it 's getting larger as we close in .

what about grissom , mr. chekov ?

we are secured from warp speed ... now entering genesis sector of mutara quadrant .

estimating genesis 2.9 hours , present speed .

excelsior , the great experiment , is adrift in space .

aye , sir , warp speed ...

i 'll need it , sulu .

the word is no . i am therefore going anyway .

oh , i 'll have `` mr. adventure '' eating out of my hand . and i 'll see you at the rendezvous . all my hopes .

good evening , commander . everything ready ?

gentlemen . good evening .

you 're right . thanks for the drink .

as surely as if it were my own ! harry , give me back the enterprise ! with scotty 's help ...

yours ... ? !

but , we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to genesis ...

welcome aboard , admiral .

perfect ! that 's the way it shall be ! ... < u > give me genesis < /u > !

if we do n't help each other , we 'll all die here !

maltz . prisoners are at beam coordinates . standby ...

no tricks . i 'm looking forward to meeting you . kirk out .

no tricks , kirk . you have one minute .

commander , klingon vessel . stand by to board this ship on my next signal .

who is this ? ! how dare you --

do not lecture me about treaty violations . the federation , in creating an ultimate weapon , has become a gang of intergalactic criminals . it is not i who will surrender , it is you . on the planet below , i have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon . if you do not surrender immediately , i will execute them , one at a time , as enemies of galactic peace .

what about spock ?

yes ... but -- how ... ?

i see ... and i understand . then everything that he was ... everything that he knew ... is lost . and when i return home empty-handed , many shall mourn .

... no ... ! ` kirk , bathed with sweat , suddenly shudders in pain . sarek opens his eyes , removes his hands . he touches kirk with gentleness as jim recovers , opens his eyes .

yes ...

kirk , i must have your thoughts . may i join your mind ?

yes , i was ...

i will speak with you alone , kirk .

ambassador , i -- i had no idea you were here ... i think you know my crew ...

i give two minutes . for you , and your gallant crew . take every last man : form a boarding party , armed heavily !

i trust my instincts . admiral kirk . this is your opponent speaking .

they know we would die first .

but sir ! federation starship approaching .

i ordered no interruptions .

we are going to this `` planet . '' even as our emissaries negotiate for `` peace '' with the federation , we will < u > act < /u > for the preservation of our race ! we will seize the secret of this weapon . the secret of ultimate power !

understood , my lord .

so ! speak !

my lord , enemy commander wishes a truce to confer .



this is n't reality . this is fantasy .

all true .

but , as you are so fond of observing , doctor , i 'm not human .

are you out of your vulcan mind ? no human can tolerate the radiation loose in there !

but what if they went -- nowhere ?

i can spare me ...

he 's been there and has n't found what he wants . can you spare someone ? there may be people hurt .

at the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it . you said it yourself ; we 're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe ...

as a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds .

it never rains but when it pours --

the inspection will continue once we 're underway , doctor .

ah .

from yourself , admiral .

and who am i hiding from ?

what do you want ? damn it , why is n't there a girl here ? you know this has nothing to do with age . this is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wan na be out hopping galaxies .

bones , i do n't want to be lectured .

thank you .

slide them down your nose . now look at me over the top . and you read printed matter through the bottom .

cheers . bones , these are ... charming .

i only use it for medicinal purposes . do n't be a pring ...

'beware romulans bearing gifts . ' happy birthday ...

physician , heal thyself .

this is completely improper , commander chekov . i have no intention of allowing reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials .

the order comes from starfleet command , dr. marcus , direct from the general staff .

all went well . nothing has happened . ceti alpha vi has checked out .

something spock was trying to tell me . on my birthday .

why ? why did n't you tell me ?

david was right , was n't he ? it 's just to keep them busy .

carol !

repeat ... what 's wrong ? what 's wrong ?

jim ... read me ? can you read me ?

this is just to give us something to do , is n't it ? come on .

david . please .

but we ca n't just sit here -- !

mother , go back !

mistake ? we 're all alone here . they waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this . reliant is supposed to be at our disposal , not vice-versa .

i do n't think there 's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks . next time , we 'll design a bigger one .

does that about do it ?

par for the course ... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner ?

well , do n't have kittens . genesis is going to work . they 'll remember you in a wreath with newton , einstein , surak ...

come on , mother , that 's just the military mentality . never put off tomorrow what you can put off today . if there 's one atom of life ...

a criminal , captain -- a product of the late 20th century genetic engineering --

never mind ! hurry !

what 's the matter -- ?

< u > botany bay < /u > -- oh no !

are you sure these are the coordinates ?

well done , commander .

there is some pain at first , i am told , and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end . that was what i learned from watching my wife .

and i 'll wager he never told you about his shipmate , the beautiful and courageous lieutenant mcgiver , who gave up everything to join me in exile . out of love . and see how < u > admiral kirk < /u > requited her devotion -- she 's dead as earth !

< u > this is ceti alpha v < /u > ! ceti alpha vi exploded six months after we were left here . the shock shifted the orbit of < u > this < /u > planet and everything was laid waste . < u > admiral < /u > kirk never bothered to check on our progress . it was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive ! on earth , two hundred years ago , i was a prince , with power over millions -- now , like prometheus i have been left by admiral kirk to digest my own entrails .

mainly . and also that i 'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son .

i was wrong about you . and < u > i 'm < /u > sorry .

so am i. my friends were killed , too .

that makes two of us . lieutenant saavik was right : you never have faced death --

i did n't expect anything .

no . i -- i guess i 'm not what you expected .

what ?

it 's the genesis wave !

we appear to have plenty of time .

she 's making it up ! my father was professor --

what are < u > you < /u > looking at ?

the admiral 's son .

i shall avenge you --

we ca n't fire , sir ; they 've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive . we must withdraw !

raise them --

sir -- our shields are dropping !

careful : not all at once . < u > the < /u > < u > engine room < /u > . lock on target and prepare to fire .

goodbye , admiral . oh , and do n't count on enterprise . she ca n't move . my next act will be to blow her out of the heavens .

kirk ! kirk , you are still alive -- my old friend ...

i take your point . stand by to receive our transmission .

i 've given you no word to keep , admiral . in my judgment , you simply have no alternative .

i give you sixty seconds , admiral .

khan , listen to me -- if its me you want , i 'll have myself beamed aboard . all i ask is that you spare my crew .

what is the meaning of this attack ? where is the crew of the reliant ?

save your strength , captain , these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born . do you mean he ... ... never told you the tale ? to amuse you , captain ? never told you how the < u > enterprise < /u > picked up the < u > botany bay < /u > , lost in space from the year 1996 , myself and the ship 's company in cryogenic freeze ?

you are in a position to demand nothing , sir . i , on the other hand , am in a position to grant nothing . what you see is all that remains of the ship 's company and the crew of the < u > botany bay < /u > , marooned here fifteen years ago by captain james t. kirk .

chekov , who is this man ?

i 'm going down to the station .

a few shots , sir .

just the batteries , sir . i can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --

we 'll be going to warp speed --

enterprise to reliant : you are ordered to surrender your vessel . respond ! nothing , sir .

do it , while we have time .

i 'm getting a voice message ... wait ... short range band . they say their chambers coil is shorting their comm system .

she 's not responding ...

no promises , mr. scott . on your way .

my sister 's youngest , admiral . crazy to get to space .

oh ? a wee bout of what , mr. scott ?

right on schedule , admiral . just give us your coordinates and we 'll beam you aboard .

not at present .

the word is given : warp speed .

yes , sir .

sporadic energy readings port side , aft . could be an impulse turn .

admiral , they 're reducing speed .

scotty , can we make it inside ?

she can out-run us and out-gun us . but there is the mutara nebula at 153 mark four .

that 's it ?

not much , admiral . we have partial main power ...

reliant could be hiding behind that rock .

... blind as a tiberian bat . what do you make of the plantoid beyond ?

wait for my signal , spock -- too soon and he 'll have time to figure it out and raise them again .

you 've got to learn why things work on a starship . it 's coming through now , khan ...

at least we know he has n't got it . just keep nodding as though i 'm giving orders . saavik , punch up the data charts of reliant 's command console -- hurry ...

who ? who knew just where to hit us ? and < u > why < /u > ?

their coil emissions are normal ... wait : their shields are going up . they 're locking phasers -- !

the tape was made a year ago . i can only assume they 've reached phase two by now --

i 'd best talk with mr. scott , first so that he may , in his own words , explain the situation to his cadets .

or the one .

you are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions .

that wo n't be necessary : just take me to regula i .

yes , we 've been through death and life together .

i know of your fondness for antiques .

sir -- we wo n't leave you behind ... !

damn . alert starfleet headquarters . i want to talk with starfleet command .

as you were , mr. saavik .

three minutes , thirty seconds .

aye , sir .

mr. scott , can you get the mains back on line ?

regulation 46-a : 'if transmissions are being monitored during battle ... '

the < u > kobayashi maru < /u > , sir .

it does n't make sense . these coordinates are well within regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless .

indeterminate life signs .

khan !

energize defense fields .

you may ask , lieutenant .

there is no correct resolution . it is a test of character .

i failed to resolve the situation .

you 're bothered by your performance on the < u > kobayashi maru < /u > .

lieutenant , self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems .

lieutenant , are you wearing your hair differently ?

a no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face . has that never occurred to you ?

prayer , mr. saavik . the klingons do not take prisoners . captain .

battle stations .

try again .

course plotted for regula i , admiral ...

stop engines .

thank you , sir . i 've looked forward to this for a long time .

i cut your new orders personally . by the end of the month , you 'll have your first command : uss excelsior .

i 'm aware of my responsibilities , mister .

certainly ...

lieutenant , the admiral is aware of the regulations .

take her out , mr. saavik .

what did you expect , lieutenant ?

he 's not what i expected , sir .

to earth . to offer testimony .

where must you go ?

why do n't i ?

i do n't know about you , but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence . i mean whales may not have painted the mona lisa or invented the dirt bike but they did n't ravish the land either .

bob ... it 's tearing me apart .

do n't tell me fish stories , kiddo . i 've known you too long .

he never jokes ... perhaps the professor could use your computer .

well , so much for the tour of our humble plant . i must say , professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive .

professor scott , i 'm dr. nichols , plant manager . i 'm terribly sorry but there 's been an awful mix-up would you believe i was never told about your visit ?

pavel , can you hear me ? give me your name and rank ...

come on , pavel ...

if you have a better idea - now 's the time .

we 've done it before .

now wait just a damn minute .

no way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him !

bones , stay here .

are you sure ? that 's what i thought .

it 'll come back to him .

you sure this is such a bright idea ?

we could learn a thing or two from this flea trap . it has a cloaking device that cost us a lot .

you 'd think they could at least send a ship . bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this klingon flea trap ...

no , spock . it means he feels safer about your `` guesses '' than most other peoples facts .

well nobody 's perfect ...

guess , spock . your best guess .

... best shot ... ?

acceleration is no longer a constant .

naturally . so what is your problem ?

then how . ?

you just said there are n't any except on earth of the past .

really ? you think this is its way of saying `` hi there '' to the people of the earth ?

i did not have time on vulcan to review the philosophical disciplines .

captain , their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power !

go ahead . stun me .

okay ... make nice and give us the ray gun .

i do not know your name .

no , < u > my < /u > name .

name ?

mr. sulu , switch to manual control !

the mains are down , sir ! aux power is not responding .

stabilize energy reserve ! ... report helm :

yes , sir .

operational , admiral . cloaking device now available in all modes of flight .

we do n't know . it 's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand ...

you 're not one of those guys from the military , are you ? trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes , or some dipshit stuff like that ?

are you sure it is n't time for a colorful metaphor ?

communicate ? communicate what ? you have no right to be here !

do n't worry . i 'll find < u > you < /u > . see you around the galaxy ...

well , i ... as they say in your century -- i do n't even have your phone number . how will i find you ?

why does it have to be goodbye ?

... you have a point ...

he means our chances of getting home are not very good . you might have lived a longer life if you 'd stayed where you belong .

all right . the frequency is 401 megahertz .

all i need is the radio frequency to track them .

they were taken last night . i was n't told . they 're in alaska by now .

... gone ? !

kirk . they 're gone .

it 's all real . look . the storage tanks for the whales .

lem me tell you something . i 'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd century . if i have to , i 'll go to the open sea to get them , but i 'd just as soon take yours -- better for me , better for you ... and better for them .

you asked . now , will you tell me something ? george and gracie 's transmitter . what 's the frequency ?

then tell me when the whales are leaving .

are you kidding ? i would n't miss this for all the tea in china .

well , why did n't you say so ? why all the coy disguises ?

all right . the truth ?

do n't tell me : you 're from outer space .

flown ... and that 's the last you 'll see of them ?

... you 're very perceptive .

good . a large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions . and a michelob .

in fact , we may be able to help -- in ways that , frankly , you could n't possibly imagine .

they 're gon na hafta take their chances .

uh huh . what about you ? where you from ?

memory problems , too .

you 've already been that . c'mon .

lds ? ? are you dyslexic on top of everything else ? come on , lem me give you a lift . i have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that 's why i work with whales .

there 's really very little point in my trying to explain .

despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return george and gracie to the open sea .

no data , admiral . computers are non-functional .

spock ... did braking thrusters fire ?

is that the logical thing to do , spock ... ?

status ?

he meant what you were saying on the tour : that if things keep on the way they 're going , humpbacks will disappear forever .

they have a right to be ... do you think they 'll help us ?

they are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man .

the hell i ca n't

you do n't have to lie ... you could exaggerate .

i see .

admiral , if we were to assume these . whales are ours to do with as we please , we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction .

come on , fellah -- speak up !

spock , do n't call me admiral . do n't you remember : you used to call me jim ... now what 's your question ?

how do you know this ... ?

simple logic will suffice . we need a map . that one should do .

well , spock , thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck , we are in the streets of san francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales . how do you propose to solve this minor problem ?

where would we find these reactors ... theoretically .

there is a 20th century possibility .

quite right , spock . mr. chekov , engage cloaking device !

i have .

but we ca n't turn away ! is there no alternative ?

the sounds , but not the language . we would be responding in gibberish .

spock ... ?

where are you going ? !

spock -- you 're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man ?

well , i ... find that understandable i mean , you 've been through a lot . station , please .

10,000 m.s.l. , admiral .

ready sir .

... aye sir ... ?

continue on course . chekov , any signs of federation escort ?

out of control , and blind as a bat !

unidentified aircraft , 40,000 feet msl , range 30 miles , bearing 010 .

sir ... estimating one nautical mile .

on screen .

admiral , i have a signal closing on the whales . bearing 328 degrees .

bearing 327 , range 600 nautical .

mercy hospital .

nothing ... i should never have left him ...

283 degrees ... 15.2 kilometers ...

from a city ? that does n't make sense ... .

individual whale song getting stronger ... this is strange , admiral . the song is directly ahead . it 's coming from san francisco .

yes , sir .

it 's under water ! there 's no way to reach it ...

ironic . when man was killing these creatures , he was destroying his own future ...

not good enough , scotty . you 've got to do better !

sorry , admiral . we just thought you 'll like to know , we 're beaming them now .

oh , twenty-four hours , give or take , staying cloaked . after that , admiral , we 'll be visible -- and dead in the water . in any case , we wo n't have enough to break out of the earth 's gravity , to say nothing of getting back home .

admiral - how am i going to handle all that weight ?

that should be enough . can you enclose it to hold water ?

scotty , how long is this bay ?

yes , admiral . sir . i have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son . david died most bravely . he saved spock . he saved us all ... i thought you should know .

well , saavik . i guess this is goodbye .

do n't concern yourself , saavik . your leave has been granted for good and proper cause . how are you feeling ?

admiral , i 'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave .

... but it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix ... !

transparent aluminum ?

just use the keyboard ...

hello ? computer ... ?

... are you joking ?

if you 'll follow me , professor --

i demand to see the owners ! i demand --

professor scott , if you 'll --

do n't know anything about it ? i find it difficult to believe that i 've come millions of miles --

all right , then this is old stuff to you .

hi . huey 205 , is n't it ?

hi .

tell her i feel fine ...

as i recall , i opposed your enlistment in starfleet ... it is possible that judgment was incorrect . your associates are people of good character .

it is not an effort . you are my son . besides ; i am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises .

it is kind of you to make this effort .

ojichan ? akira ojichaan dewa naino ? koko de nani shiteru no ?

i thought it might begin the healing process .

you 're ro'tin , are n't you ... ? there 's something in the voice . would you be his friend gal'na ? i helped your mother bathe you when you were a child . she still speaks of you .

i should warn you ... i 've always been attracted to older women ...

what 's the rush ?

roughly translated : puberty ... although for a klingon that 's not doing it justice ... any severe mood swings , unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away ...

we can hold them off a long time ... once we get there ... but they will not make it easy to get there ...

there 's one thing i do n't understand . in three hundred years ... you never learned to swim ?

you 'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday ... stop planning for tomorrow ... until you find ... let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time ?

an apprentice for thirty years . we 've noticed your people 's mental discipline . did that develop here ?

there are days .

most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down .

we 've ... just begun to . i suppose you 're seventy-five .

if i were in your shoes , i 'd feel the same way after what happened . the 'artificial lifeform ' is a member of my crew . apparently , he became ... ill ...

we were under the impression they were being held against their will .

i have to go home now .

why not ... ?

androids ... do n't have ... fun .

chase me !

no , i mean ...

i play the violin ... and my chess routines are quite advanced ...

i would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child .

my legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters . they were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day i was created . they will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day i go off line . my operation depends on specifications that do not change . i ... can not imagine ... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet ...

i know why . so people like us wo n't be afraid of you any more .

i aspire to be more than i am .

i am better .

you 're what ?

if not for data , you 'd probably have been re-located by now .

the artificial lifeform was right ?

safer than leaving her here .

yes . but look at this medscan ...

very funny ...

will the structure hold if we blast through ?

until this week , that young man probably never saw a machine , let alone one that walks and talks ...

hello , data ...

picard 's first officer . do you really believe he 'll listen ?

talk ... we should send down an assault team and take them by force .

it is n't safe for you to remain in this area .

i prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the federation ...

if a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the federation what happened here , then i welcome it .

order them to surrender , and i promise you wo n't be court- martialed .

it would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition . some of them wo n't survive that long . besides , they do n't want to live in the middle of the briar patch ... who would ?

the concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work . do n't ask me to explain it . i only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction . after it 's over , the planet will be unlivable for generations .

on earth , petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders . warp drive transformed a bunch of romulan thugs into an empire . we can handle the son ' a , i 'm not worried about that ...

how can there be an order to abandon the prime directive ... ?

your `` briar patch '' turned out to be more hospitable than i expected .

good luck . dougherty out .

understood .

all right . you have twelve hours , captain . then i want you out of the briar patch . in the meantime , we 'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for son ' a reinforcements in case you fail .

captain , i was n't expecting you .

we have n't fully identified the anomalies yet . they 're calling this whole area the briar patch ... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you . just get me data 's schematics . i 'll keep you informed . dougherty out .

that 's probably not a good idea . your ship has n't been fitted for this region ; there are environmental concerns ...

... and now he 's holding our people hostage down there ...

the countdown control has been transferred to the collector ... i ca n't override ...

deploy the collector .

i 'm sure . just do n't forget what they did to us . we 'll have them rounded up in a day or two ... we need n't bother with the federation holo-ship any more . just get the holding cells ready .

implants bothering you ?

so , you 're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong .

by a son ' a weapon . there 's no doubt about it , sir . that 's what made data malfunction .

do you know how they were damaged ?

i took these out of data 's neural net ... they contain memory engrams ...

they ... are in opposite directions , sir ...

that 's your expert opinion ?

will that stop the tear ?

full impulse .

even if it does n't , they 'll be teaching kids as the academy not to do this for years to come .

if it works you mean .

the purpose being i intend to shove it down the son ' a 's throat .

they 're powering their forward weapons array .

there 's a short letter i left you all , just some ... sentimental nonsense ... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred ... i 'd just as soon you delete it ...

you must be planning on doing some hunting .

admiral dougherty wants to know why we have n't left yet ...

'yew-cheen chef-faw . '

i 'm afraid there 's too much bitterness ... on both sides .

as you wish . but i would ask you to disarm yourselves . this village is a sanctuary of life .

i understand . tell doctor crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready ...

we 're trying to get to you , sir ...

i ... i must have slept through my alarm . i 'm on my way ...

negative . he 's established a security field around the control room ...

all injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line .

picard to crusher ...

i 'm not letting go of him .

sir , inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance ... if we do n't release him , he may destroy both vessels ...

do you know gilbert and sullivan ?

evasive maneuvers ... heading one- four-zero mark three-one ...

beam him out !

you have two days to become experts ... mister worf , your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture data .

... population three hundred million ...

augh .

what i need , i ca n't get from doctor crusher ... counselor , do you think it 's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they 've made ?

... i believe you ...

come in . hi .

isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor ...

they must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here .

all ship functions are off-line .

sir , i am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels ...

initiate launch sequence .

i look forward to reading your report .

admiral ... what 's the status of the borg fleet ?

how did doctor almack react to that ?

let 's hope so . because if cochrane dies ... the future may die with him .

there must be some good people ... even in this time .

i 'm saying they might shoot us on sight . you have to remember ... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them .

yes ...

bag him .

we have two ... but we do n't have the juice to run them .

vulcan ?

there is a perimeter alert . a ship has entered sensor range .

my creator did not intend for me to experience these things .

i wish to ... go back to the way i was .

you 're becoming more human all the time , data . now you 're learning how to lie .

what a cold description ... for such a beautiful gift .

intelligence ... ambition ... desire ... i bring order to chaos ...

the vortex is collapsing , sir .

we are approaching the terran system , captain .

who are you ?

you are an imperfect being ... created by an imperfect being . finding your weakness is only a matter of time .

no . human beings do not have that luxury , and neither should i .

i am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming . grief , loss , remorse ...

outside , around back . next to the water tank .

where ?

i told you , there 's no --

< u > engage. < /u >

the nacelles are charged ... nuclear warhead standing by . we 're ready to ignite the warp drive .

altitude fifty kilometers ...

captain --

always am .

there should be an access hatch nearby ...

let 's go .

i have the silo , sir . bearing three one zero ... distance , three hundred meters .

ready .

active .

well , with any luck ... the vulcans will land outside resurrection tomorrow morning ... and earth will never be the same again .

it 'll be tight , but we should make it .

and you know all this ... because < u > you 're < /u > a space-man too ...

what do you want ?

not yet .

something wrong with that ?

maybe you can tell me what he 's been doing in that silo . we heard some explosions out there this morning ...

yes .

it was n't a trick . i used to be an electrical engineer .

not really . i was born and raised right here . never had much use for travel .

oh ... here and there . you know how it is .

yes .

why ?

where ? and do n't tell me san francisco ...

a key piece of the ship has been destroyed ... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like .

we 're trying to repair doctor cochrane 's ship . it 's been damaged and --

it ca n't wait until tomorrow ...

how did you know about that ?

we have to follow them back ... repair whatever damage they 've done to that time-line .

aye , sir .

worf , have doctor crusher , mister la forge and a security team meet me in transporter room three . civilian clothes .

intercept course , full impulse . weapons status ?

hull integrity down to thirty percent ...

captain , there are five borg ships closing in on our position .

aye , sir .

time travel ... they 're attempting time travel ... full power , mister data . worf , quantum torpedoes at my command !

port battery , ready sir !

yes , sir . but captain ... are we ... all going back ?

i 'll keep in contact . you have the bridge .

looks like they damaged the silo ...

worf ... torpedo ... now !

worf ! i 'm going to need at least five minutes !

try not to look at the stars ... keep your eyes on the ship .

agreed . options ?

it appears that someone has taken over the environmental control room .

assign another team if you need to . i want to re-establish communication with the captain as soon as possible .

hold that thought .

i think mister worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll ...

to do what ? if they wanted a weapon , they could 've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay ...

someone ... ?

they may be trying to send a message to the other borg ... the borg in this time period ...

data 's positronic net contains classified information on the enterprise . command codes , security protocols ...

there were no planetary defense systems in this era . their weapons were designed to fight each other ... not extraterrestrials .

captain , they 're firing at a nuclear missile silo ... in central montana .

that 's the question -

we were beginning to hit our stride together , doctor ...

thank you , nurse . jim , she 's ready ! lock and load !

we do sleep lying down .

i 'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know ...

the charge is murder .

killed trying to escape - it 's a classic ...

damned clever if you ask me ...

no way . you see this ?

more than ever .

what is it with you , anyway ?

well , if you 've got any bright ideas , now 's the time to -

no more neutral zone . i was used to hating klingons ... that 's why i failed in our assignment . it never even occurred to me to take gorkon at his word . spock was right .

i did n't mean this future .

speak for yourself . one day ... one night ...

we 've been set up all along .

what 's the brotherhood of aliens ?

sweet jesus ... ! he 's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is ...

uh , jim ...

they do n't arrest people for having feelings .

in space , no one can hear you sweat .

too bad we ca n't smell her .

we 're explorers not diplomats !

i tried to save him ! i was desperate to save him ! he was the last best hope in the universe for real peace .

have you saved patients as `` barely '' alive as he was ?

aside from a touch of arthritis , i 'd say pretty good .

i do n't wonder . stop me if i 'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you ?

what are you in for , if you do n't mind me asking ?

i do n't believe we can get more out of the way than this .

so if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?

i can not confirm or deny actions which i did not witness .

and you were obeying or disobeying orders the night you arranged the assassination of chancellor gorkon ?

i have on occasion disobeyed orders .

those words were spoken by me .

are those your words ?

and now we come to the architect of this tragic affair , captain james tiberius kirk . i put it to you , captain , that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son .

what happened ?

my god , what happened here ?

i beg your pardon ?

second star to the right - and straight on till morning ...

course heading , captain ?

aye , sir ; thrusters ...

where is the conference ?

captain , if they fire at us with our shields down --

torpedo room -- ?

captain , you 're not going to show them the bridge ? ?

she programmed the torpedo hits ?

now we go to starfleet ?

this is the first evidence that corroborates our theory .

klingon blood .

mr. valtane , any more data ?

we must do this again soon .

thank you , captain kirk . the evening has been most ... edifying .

starfleet 's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres . all vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors ...

your research laboratory is most impressive ...

kill him ! he 's the one ! !

and your coat .

you hear that ?

uhura , signal our surrender .

right standard rudder , z plus five degrees ...

uhura , hailing frequencies . right standard rudder , bring us alongside ...

i gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment ... i do n't think many on board are .

kronos , sir ?

captain , may i remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock ?

i 'm telling you . hang on . how many of those things are there ? come on , lieutenant , you 're charged with murder ...

standing by , captain kirk .

sulu !

... is to trust him .

but we have n't run out of history just yet . your father quoted hamlet : he called the future - `` the undiscovered country '' ...

what 's she waiting for ?

the night is young . anyway , it was logical . you know , you 're a great one for logic . i 'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread . we 're both extremists . reality is probably somewhere in between us .

azetbur has agreed to meet the federation at a undisclosed location to continue her father 's work ... the conspirators obviously intend to try again ...

he was just about to explain the whole damn -

perhaps you 're right .

we have n't fired -

curiously it appears to emanate from us .

i do n't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy ...

never been this close .

do n't trust them . do n't believe them -

not from a distance . she wo n't show up on any type of scan .

this is enterprise . we surrender . repeat enterprise surrenders --

if you are logical .

a lie ?

commander uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir .

such things have happened before , sir .

her own father ... ?

how did you - ?

you must have faith .

direct hit -

no , sir .

you having hearing problems , mister ?

signal starfleet that ... we have no idea location of enterprise .

what is it ?

negative . the subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three , mark seven-five , the location is ... praxis . a klingon moon . barren of indigenous life forms but -

do n't tell me that was any meteor shower .

i have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --

- could take weeks , sir .

not from us !

they do n't place the same value on life that we do , spock - you know that ... take my word : she did n't shed one bloody tear ...

you can check the torpedoes visually , if you like -

at least we must keep track of where they are taken , sir . i -

but you did n't join a conspiracy .

at present , he 's surrounded by a magnetic shield . if my calculations are correct , he should be deep into his escape planning by this time .

mr. scott , any progress on repairing our warp drive ?

what exactly does that mean ?

sulu 's giving us his position and telling us he 's standing by ...

do you know anything about shinzon 's plans against the federation ?

you have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship .

why ?

yes , please continue .

i was taken from my homeworld by people called the `` pakjeds . '' they are fat . they traded me to a ship belonging to the `` bolians . '' the `` bolians '' are blue . they put me in a seat and asked me questions . then they were attacked by another ship ...

can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you ?

they 're running me ragged . nothing but question day and night ... i love it ! come to dinner and 1 ' 1 tell you all about it . there 's a bajoran band at the officer 's mess .

you can ' t imagine them , jean luc . they 're kids ! all with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant .

how far we 've come . let me know if you need anything .

i 'm counting on it ... we 've been ordered to head to sector 3274. starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there .

as a result the temporal sequencing was never activated . remember , he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age . he was engineered to skip thirty years of life . but since the rna sequencing was never activated , his cellular structure has started to break down . he 's dying .

the more i studied his dna the more confusing it got . finally i could only come to one conclusion ... shinzon was created with temporal rna sequencing . he was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly , so he could replace you .

i so wanted to believe shinzon . but the thalaron radiation ca n't be explained away . whatever he 's after , it 's not peace .

i notice dr. crusher laughing along with the rest of you . as most of you know , the doctor will also soon be leaving the enterprise , to assume command of starfleet medical . again , i 'm forced to ask , beverly , have you considered what you 're doing to little ole me ? ! i 'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who 'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if i dont show up for my physical on time !

full axis rotation to port ! fire all ventral phasers !

we are passing through the bassen rift . the projections will return when we have cleared it .

how can you be sure ?

no , sir , it is not possible . the b-9 is physically identical to me , although his neural pathways are not as advanced . but even if they were , he would not be me .

he may have already rejected my humanity , but you also have a twin

yes .

ready , captain .

do you think this is a wise course of action ?

can you open the shuttlebay doors ?

what do you imagine this is ?

there is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location .

it 'll only work for one of us .

on my way .

he is very observant .

to new worlds ...

if i were ... i believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior . i would `` miss you . ''

the choices i made have led me here as well . this is the only home i have ever known . i can not foresee a reason for leaving .

i understand why it would seem confusing . certain human rituals ... like weddings , birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions . these rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time .

so ... to happy endings .

because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle .

i am not .

do n't give up hope , data . i know , i know , you 're not capable of hope .

it 's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing . mind if i keep him here and run some diagnostics ?

he 'd have all your memories too . you feel comfortable with that ?

i ca n't believe the captain went along with a memory download .

at present he serves no useful function . dr. soong created us to become active and useful members of society . i do not believe he would have wanted the b-9 to live out his life in his present state .

thank you .

i would like to pick you up now . may i do that ?

no .

counselor ?

deanna troi of betazed . empathic and telepathic abilities , ship 's counselor . all of this i knew ... but i did n't know you were so beautiful .

ready , sir !

aye , sir .

he 's getting his cloak back . we have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes . phaser banks are down to four percent .

it 's called a cascading bio- genic pulse . the unique properties of thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits . depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship ... or a planet .

set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting . if it happens again , we want to be ready .

that 's what i do n't get -- it 's mostly basic stellar cartography : star charts ; communications protocols ; some uplinks from colony tracking stations . it 's not even restricted material .

what programs were accessed ?

then how did a reman get to be praetor ? i do n't get it .

just lucky , admiral .



understood .

believe me , we do n't under- stand it either . you 're the closest ship so i want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say . get the lay of the land , if the empire becomes unstable , it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant .

admiral janeway . good to see you .

what are you doing to counsellor troi ?

enterprise . we are the reman warbird scimitar .

aye , sir

we 're being hailed .

sir , i recommend we raise shields .

when your first officer insists that you ca n't go on away missions ... ignore him .

he 's firing through his cloak . we ca n't get a lock .

patience . diplomacy is a very exacting occupation . we can wait .

captain , with all due respect to diplomatic protocols -- the federation council 's not sitting out here , we are .

a coup d'etat ?

thank you , sir ...

still well on our side ...

i am .

i hope you 're still alive , jean luc .

i have no choices ! i ca n't fight what i am !

its too late .

i know ... you 'll all gladly die to save your home world .

to accept your surrender . i can clearly destroy you at any time . lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship .

i think the facts speak for themselves . the same noble picard blood runs in our veins . had you lived my life , you 'd be doing exactly as i am . look in the mirror , and see yourself .

it amazes me how little you know yourself .

my life is meaningless as long as you 're alive . what am i while you exist ? a shadow ? an enigma ?

i see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is .

maybe i 'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does . or maybe ill snap its ugly head off .

i need a sample of your blood . what do your borg friends say ? resistance is futile .

in time , jean luc .

i 'm honored to think i might someday speak with such eloquence .

with a full head of hair .

yes .

were we always explorers ?

yes . the eyes have it .

a lifetime of violence will do that . my nose was broken four times . and my jaw ... but so much is the same . the eyes , you recognize the eyes .

not quite . i envy the hair- line .

you know i do .

no one knew what to do . finally i was taken to a doctor who had some experience with terran illnesses and i was finally diagnosed with shalaft 's syndrome . do you know of it , captain ?

yes , i 'm sorry , captain . there 's so much we have to talk about .

praetor ?

but , praetor , you wo n't survive without him ...

defensive pattern kirk epsilon . geordi , get those shields online .

minimal damage to the scimitar .

what is it ? ! ! focus on your job ! !

you heard me .

what ? !

seven minutes .

how long ?

yes , praetor .

are we prepared ?

and mine is wearing thin , young man ! we supported you because you promised action . and yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with picard while --



praetor .

you do n't have to understand .

i came this far alone ...

the scimitar will serve my needs .

it 's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath .

i do n't think so ...

mike , call for back-up . benny , you all right ?

right in line with that burning tree .

i 'll take that .

have a nice trip .

no .

what do you do ?

food . eat . i prepare food . i work as a cook . that 's how i make money .

stay right there ...

what the hell do you think you 're doing ?

houston found it in the extraterrestrial 's suit .

it 's a copy of the plaque nasa sent into space on the pioneer probes .

recognize this ?

major bell here , sir . we have to tell these people that we 're friendly . that this whole thing was a mistake . is anyone trying to contact the ship ?

i just retired .

george ... do you hear me , george ?

you 're talking about taking a life . the most unique life form on this planet . i think we 're better than that .

then you 're going to have to do it without me .

that 's the chance we have to take .

i 'm not being unpatriotic , and i 'm doing my damndest to catch them . bell 's up on 80 and i 'm down here on 70 past grand junction . they 're heading west . if they 're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them . all i 'm asking is that you people think about it .

is that what 's affecting your performance ?

we 're growing very concerned back here . there 's no use pretending otherwise . we 're rapidly approaching a 'condition red . ' people are beginning to ask difficult questions .

we do n't know what else to do . we need results .

it 's messy ... the thing 's got a gun ... we 're just asking for somebody to get killed ...

i 'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk .

it 's made itself look like the woman 's dead husband .

it 's taken on a disguise .

george , we 've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial .

do n't let them do it this way , george . it 's too important . we ca n't find this thing alone .

we 'll get those answers when you find the one you 're looking for .

what do you mean by 'contain ? '

i wo n't let anyone hurt you .

you can speak to me , mrs. haydn . i 'm in charge of this operation now .

he does n't want to hurt anybody . please leave him alone .

mrs. haydn ...

mr ... i 'm sorry , what was your name again ?

is the man who kidnapped you there now ?

tell the baby about me .

i will wave to you .

the yellow one .

how long will it take you to get home ?

you want the baby to laugh at me .

i will say that we can be friends .

many of my people will not believe those things are possible . on my planet there is only one government , one people , one language . i will be asked a lot of questions .

i understand .

it 'll tell you pretty much everything about us ...

but ...

you have been very good to me , jennyhaydn . you said you wanted a baby , so i gave you one .

yes , they are .

they are beautiful .

you do n't forget anything , do you ?

good morning .

i do not get cold .

the cook .

why ca n't we wait here for a ride ?

the police know about lathrop wells . we have to go another way . come on .

no . i 'm just not tired . let 's go .

i 'm not sleepy anymore . let 's drive for a little while longer .

no . get in .

hurry up .

i am not a good singer .

do n't be afraid ... i 'd really like to hear it .

i 'd like to hear it . can you sing something ?

not all ... but it feels like a kiss .

are you my friend ?

he will .

a friend is a person that is good to you ... someone you like to be with ... someone you like to laugh with ...

i do n't understand 'friend . '

the captain ...

yes ?

i was afraid .

it 's a kiss ... goodbye ...

goodbye .

do n't be afraid . do what i told you and you 'll be okay .

right . in omaha the driver will put you on the bus for salt lake city and the new driver will take ... ... this part . when you get to salt lake city , ask the driver , 'las vegas , please ' ...

what is hitchhike ?

i ca n't ... forget the baby . okay ? the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells . you 'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way .

a baby is a new person ?

when we get here .

i feel like i 'm going crazy here . you 're scott . but he 's dead . i do n't know what 's real anymore . i ca n't be here with you .

no .

then let me go . you do n't need me .

you better .

it was yellow .

i want to try it .

no .

my ... husband .

who ?

gas .

from ?

who is he ? who is she ? who are you ? who am i ? who are you ?

what ?

closed ?

yes . very good .

no gas .

what ? !

we 're going to have to stop for gas soon .

what ?

that way .

police ...

gear shift .

ah ... no ...

please .

do n't ... do n't do this ... please ...

please ...

hey , she does n't want to go with you . come on .

jesus christ ! ! you crazy people ...

he 's kidnapping me ! ! !

sure .

pull over . i 've got to get back there .

this is going to be a real drag . i thought you wanted to go fast .

in the cars , too ? !

geez , mrs. haydn , we just got going .

my grandmother 's rich .

we 're ready .

maybe he 's turned her into one of them . they enter the crowd around the helicopter .

does n't make sense .

bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow .

you have no conception of this , do you ?

jesus lyman , you 're an ignorant fool .

yes .

to the same woman ?

no , sir . radar .

was there visual contact ?

any signs of biological contamination , excessive radiation , anything like that ?

scott haydn is dead . he died about three months ago . we went to the funeral .

you know that 's impossible !

if i talk to you , i will miss my ship .

i must get to my ship , mr. shermin .

i already got a real one . come on , it wo n't be too bad . it 's not personal .

okay , let 's get you wired up . i hope this axle grease you got in your hair does n't screw up the squid receptors .

take her up to the suite . have a glass of champagne ... or six ... i 'll be up in a while to help you ring in the new year .

well , i 'm certainly in the mood for a party .

maybe later .

you said you were going to get her out of this .

you 're too goddamned paranoid .

lenny the loser . panhandler of stolen dreams .

i know . i do n't always do exactly what i 'm told . so i said , 'do you enjoy watching me ? ' and you said -- come on max .

you were supposed to go downstairs , baby .

look , baby , it 's now of never ... the guy is a known input junkie , so a little od wo n't surprise anybody . it 's the only way we can be together . you know it 's true .

hey , he was going to kill you . and this ratfuck paid to have iris killed , to save his own sorry ass .

this piece of puke hired me to kill you , baby . do you believe that ? is n't that right , tran ? you pinhead .

what a nightmare .

you think tran killed her ?

we should talk alone .

look , baby , i 've watched you create yourself out of nothing . you 're like a goddamn cruise missile , targeted on making it . and you will .

maybe .

what ? he gon na record you on his label ?

it 's tran , is n't it ? this guy is poison , faith . listen to me . he 's got you walled in on all sides . and he uses the wire too much , he gets off on tape , not on you .

let it alone , lenny . it 'll take care of itself .

tonight .

you have to go . i mean it .

i do n't think that 's a good idea , lenny .

i do n't feel anything . is it on ?

i feel like you 're turning me into a vcr .

i can get you what you want . you just have to talk to me . i 'm your priest , your shrink , your main connection to the switchboard of souls . i 'm the magic man , the santa claus of the subconscious . you say it , you even think it , you can have it . you want a girl , you want two girls ? i do n't know what your thing is or what you 're curious about ... you want a guy ? you want to be a girl ... see what that feels like ? you want a nun to tie you up ? it 's all doable .

exactly anything . whatever you want . whoever you want to be . fabri , get us another round , would you .

you got froggy on me a couple times .

only he does n't know about me and faith . so i say to myself , if i turn the job down , he just gets somebody else . and i lose faith ... to coin a phrase . so to buy time , i do the skank . i still got ta do something about tran ... i figure it 's him or me ... but i ca n't cap him without a chump to take the fall . and who better than his girlfriend 's loser ex-boyfriend ... a known criminal ... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times .

what makes you think i 'm gon na kill tran ?

i 'll have that . glock 22. nice .

i intend to .

come on ! if he gives us any shit , we kill 'em all . whattya say ? just get your butt down here . if i 'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room . it 's 2203. you writin ' ?

this is what we laughingly refer to as a plan , right ?

yeah . so do n't walk near me in public , alright .

what stuff ?

all i 'm saying ... you do n't know how high up the food chain this thing goes . i 've heard stuff .

whattya mean ?

faith ok ?

w'sup , max ?

why me ?

top ten .

so she feels ... what he feels ... while he 's in her . the thrill while he 's killing her ... is sent to her , heightening her fear ... which in turn heightens the turn on for him . i 've seen a lot , max .

you alright ? y'okay ?

i 'm on her .

you should feel like shit .

shoulda told me about your new gig , buddy .

shutup a second !

hey , iris , you okay ?

i just hate to see you pining away . it makes me want to vomit , frankly . broken hearts are for assholes .

just as well , lenny . you got ta get past it . i mean sure , faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get , i mean it 's completely and deeply humiliating that she 's gone , but it 's over , campadre .

you were lucky , max .

that 's not sayin ' much .

d'you always have to dress like a fuckin ' pimp ?

least you can do .

come on , amigo , the world 's full of marks . and nobody knows how to work 'em like you do , pal . you could sell a goddamn rat 's asshole for a wedding ring ! let me buy you a drink .

yeah , she came by last night . shaking like a junkie , wanting me to make a copy of some clip .

who was just here ?

what ?

i said that ? look , i 'll take it for five , and you 'll make out okay , because in this case it 's pure cream , you do n't have to cut anything back to the wearer .

hey , you 're always saying , 'bring me real life . bring me street life . and , like , one man 's mundane and desperate existence is another man 's technicolor . '

well you could 've at least warned me . you know i hate the zap ... when they die . it just brings down your whole day . jeez , tick .

i already got everything i need from you .

i do n't like disappointments , nero . and do you know what disappoints me very much ?

strickland .

nero .

yeah . see you there .

yeah , right . fucked .

no . trust me .

that 's the original . there are no copies .

and do what ? take on his whole posse ?

you see tran ?

good , lenny . i can see why the detective gig did n't work out . come on .

mace ... you 're a girl .

whatya mean ? we 're going ! tran 's gon na do her right there unless --

kinda guy you can count on in a pinch .

people finding out ... seeing ... that the lapd just flat out executed jeriko one . jesus . maybe they ought to see .

mace . i know what you think about the wire . but i 'm asking you to do this . it 's that important .

she wanted to go out to my car , something about my car ...

you better keep a low profile for a while .

will you relax . there 's nobody back there .

s'okay . i know you still love me .

and what about the guy that was following me ?

so the guy 's not a sicko .

she said `` if they get me '' . they . which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover , which means somebody whacked her for a reason .

because iris knew somebody was after her .

yeah . i 'm ghosting pretty bad .

it gives me ... i do n't know ... maybe two hundred people who i know wear .

so that gives you something .

never really thought about it .

are you sure it 's real ?

blackjack ? i do n't understand --

no idea .

it is my sword and my shield , macey .

she still loves me .

rams ... that 's football , right ?

guy named wade beemer . used to be a running back for the rams in '96 and '97 .

who 's the new side of beef in tran 's posse ?

jesus , lenny .

i know you would n't be saying all this if you did n't care about me . thanks , mace . really .

you will not live to see the morning .

what the fuck are you doing ?

yeah , but that was for love .

price he pays for being a scumsucking pig .

uh huh , i wan na hear this part .

buncha techno-perv jerkoffs .

so , what 's up with you ? another busy night selling porno to wireheads ?

mace ! you 're a life-saver .

sleaze to peddle .

whoa , whoa , whoa . i said i 'd drop you home , but i 'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds . i 've already pulled twelve hours today .

well give me some then ... i 'm starving .

this seems a little sophisticated for them . these are not subtle guys .

take the tape to the cops .

sssssh ! not in front of lenny . you may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him .

you got that right . low became obsessed with the green river murders , the case had been inactive for ten years at that point . he argued the green river killer had actually become suspect zero , this master murderer who killed without pattern , killed literally hundreds of victims -- male , female , old , young , straight , gay -- and who was still killing , even though there were no bodies . it went against everything we knew . low became increasingly paranoid . every suspect was potentially suspect zero . anybody tried to talk sense into him , he 'd accuse them of being out to get him . deputy director koessler was `` out to get him . '' the decision was made to relieve him .

no .

no , sir .

just mopping up . nine bodies in all .

agent duncan , there 's an interstate issue up on 54 , run out there .

takes four days to chill , then its time to come back . is that ... ?

welcome back , sir . how was the vacation ?

she 's buried .

tape it off , we 'll want to fine-tooth- comb it . my guess is that the unsub is having us on . he checks in , pays , picks up the key , but never walks inside . tell me if i 'm wrong .

oh jesus , sheriff , i am sorry . i meant to call you -- i got distracted -- the sumpter girl was not one of speck 's victims . that 's the good news .

this is n't in our database ?

you run the plates ?

the body was embalmed . i do n't understand --

that 's the thing . do n't know if it connects , but harold here had a thing about eyes . two of the victims had their eyes gouged out , another punctured . took polaroids after .

be my guest , agent kulok , scrub suits are in the back .

i appreciate it , doctor . you know how it is , press screaming for answers , washington 's all over me . ever handle a serial case ?

it 's been customized for sleeping capacity .

you ca n't imagine how many men have told me that .

you 're a ... you 're sick .

take a look , harold . tell me if you see anything you want . you do like to look , do n't you ?

what ?

i do n't mean to be rude , but ...

whole country or just hereabouts ?

you ... surprised me .

it 's been wiped down a hundred times since then .

he had an orange hat on .

yes .

let 's take a look at it . drop off my stuff at the hotel after you 're done here .

you have the photo from the diner ?

what 's with the eyelids ?

nada . vague description , that 's all . fine-tooth-combed speck 's car , the diner : no fingerprints , no trace evidence .

speck 's the killer all right . we got box loads of evidence . did 'em all the same way : torture , strangulation . prostitutes . i do n't think we 'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count .

just step outside , sir . now . keep your hands where i can see them .

deputy director , get out , sir .

smarter than us .

hawkins is n't the target , richard low 's the target .

i understand .

watch out for dick low , he 's a liar ; he has his own world . there was a junior agent in seattle , not unlike you , an agent who fell under dick 's spell . he 'd have done anything for agent low . richard got this agent to take a suspect to the crime scene , beat him up , force a confession -- all unauthorized , all illegal . the agent died that night , killed by the suspect . richard low got him killed . worst of all , we had to hush it up , let the suspect go . the suspect was george sheldon , the second man richard killed .

we need to put out an ncic inquiry .

i suspected , but you were the one low contacted . that 's why i brought you back here .

how long ago ?

i do n't believe this .

agent kulok and i were in o'hare when we heard .

pretty embarrassed , to be honest . i had him .

then why do i still have a badge ?

its called insubordination .

i was lucky to find , much less crack , the address code -- no way to be sure i could have done it again .

let some by-the-book j. edgar agents go into the chat room , spook these guys with stupid questions , blow my cover ? -- no way .

i had gotten their trust . we were sharing fantasies . i could n't risk it .

from the grave ?

speck . harold speck .

i think i talked to him .

this better be important .

agent kulok , that boy , as we speak , is in hawkins ' truck , probably still alive , in a dark refrigerated compartment , shivering in just a t- shirt : put yourself in his mind , freezing , terrified , wanting his mother . put yourself in his mother 's place , desperate , imagining the worst is happening as she pleads , back there at the rest stop , for someone , anyone , to listen to her . this is not hypothetical , this is real . it is happening now and you can do something about it .

listen to this guy ? can you believe this ? he 'll never change . born a liar , first word out of his mouth was a lie . make up a story , always a story , any goddamn story , to save his ass .

get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years . we 've got three disappearance cities and dates , three parallel discovery cities . get into the mainframe , let it crunch this information .

i 've got to take a piss .

that 's what koessler wants us to believe . to discredit low .

all the same killer ?

it 's too late for that . i 've gone ahead of the curve on this one . there 's no turning back . when this is over , koessler is going to be right or low is going to be right or i 'm going to be right , but not all of us .

and you 're working with him ?

that 's a crackpot theory . everybody says so .

where are you ? everybody 's looking for you .

hello ?

that 's my point . remember , you 're a cop pretending to be a deviant . it 's not the other way around .

i found a peephole into deviant world . i 'm gon na reach in and yank some of those creeps out .

then there 's the other issue .

no , i mean maybe we should back off a bit , you and me .

not yet . this time they 're waiting for you .

sue ann hanson .

we got an unsub walking around with four feet ?

what did you tell him ?

i know .

it 's a no-no .

because you asked him to , stupid .

when you were his student ? did he come on to you ?

every cop has a story and every story has a girl . the girl in my story was fifteen years-old . she wore a pink angora sweater -- i can still see it -- one day , she disappeared . i told the police she would n't run away , i told them who to look for , but i was just a kid . i sat in the police station crying and crying . my parents took me home . the girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher i 'd had . he kept her alive a week before he killed her . the police could have saved her . every time i see a photo of a victim i see her . that 's what i want to do . i want to save her .

he thinks he looks young .

i was going to be a physician , i am a physician , but i kept drifting over to criminal psych . this seems to be the best of both . my parents still have n't forgiven me .

taking a stryker saw , cutting off the top of someone 's cranium , pulling the brain out -- what 's that , a day in spring ?

the other reason ?

that 's part of the reason i dropped by . i need to learn this stuff .

that 's the beauty of the system . this is a fugitive chat room . it moves from place to place , chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours : a gardening website , chaucer buffs , a dating service . a pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that 's where i stumbled across it -- notifying `` friends '' to meet at a certain time , usually midnight to three eastern standard , at a certain website -- a deserted chat room , say , `` how to plant perennials . '' come tuesday , twelve a.m. , bingo , these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up : explicit sex crime gossip , who did what to whom , who wants to do what , when , why and how .

setting up . technically , anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address . but , by using punters , a correspondent literally punts his address around the world , through computers in countries that have no communication treaties . the correspondent becomes `` ghosted , '' invisible .

the man knew how to dress .

it explains a lot .

a very sexy case .

that information 's being withheld from the media .

and who kills in the manner of his victim .

yeah , you know the vic 's car , he was killed this side of the state line , the car then pushed across the border . this by an unknown subject , presumably the killer , who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot , which may or may not have been accidental .

five months . i love it .

how long have you been downtown ?

the academy , then ciiac .

none taken .

thanks for the ride .

bitch ! cunt ! please , please , please do n't do this , agent kulok . you need me .

no weapon .

i want to protect the boy . i also want to protect suspect zero -- from you .

agent kulok , could you wipe my face ?

yeah .

i know you , lionheart . i watched your mind work , heard your dirty thoughts --

who told you about her ?

i already have an employer .

please . you ca n't hide from me , sonny . i invented the questionnaire . i can tell those who talk from those who do it in the time it takes you to fart .

daitz hinted it existed . it was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms .

he could n't break an egg with a hammer . he still writing those crime porn books ?

when you exit , head east on 10th .

yes .

the little piggie speaks .

leave this room , i 'll go back with you , blow your cover .

[ you tell me . ]

[ if you wanted a good steak , you should have gone to omaha . ]

if i owe , i will go .

he wants us to know he 's out there , what he 's doing . it 's not enough just to kill somebody like speck , he wants us to know he did it .

but why attack an agent ?

eight , nine months ago . when i was at computer crime . i got into a chat room with someone named mydick . i 'd talked to him before . everything i saw yesterday , everything in the autopsies , it 's identical . the forensics are dead on . mydick 's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig , nylon cord , torture with pliers , rip the nipples -- when the `` item '' screams , she chokes . he had a thing about eyes , always the eyes -- stab their eyes . it 's the same guy . speck was mydick .

mydick . as in my dick . that was his screen name .

got a vehicle ? head north on 54. when you get to new mexico you 've gone too far .

jesus , just what i need , another blue flamer . johnny , get this boy some sun screen .

i wished to be reinstated at computer crimes . i was undiplomatic in my request .

thomas mackelway .

what did you do to end up here ?

he 's a brilliant man . brilliant enough to catch you .

do n't do it , mike .

ever since i 've known you .

you have to put things in perspective .

i 'd say about two weeks .

what 's that like ?

yeah .

... monday nights ? i host an open mike ...

i 've seen you somewhere ... where have i seen you ?

thanks .

i 'm sorry , i could n't help it . let me make it up to you .

oh ... a cavalier .

what do you drive ?

no ... maybe that 's not the case . maybe she should n't be such a smug little shit because she 'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is , but it 's been a long time and he does n't know if he 's ready to ...

maybe it does n't matter if he 's a good dancer cause it 's a slow song , if that 's what he 's afraid of .

like if i meet a handsome young man and i wanted to ask him to dance ? i can do that ?

anything .

well , it still sucks , but you start to see that there are advantages to being single .

oh , god . that 's two more than me . tell me it gets better .

yeah .

well , it was n't the simple , but yeah .

just like that ?

my reputation seems to have preceded me .

yes . like the quiche .

i 'm mike .

yeah , i 'll tell her i do n't remember and then i 'll ask what she looks like . then i 'll ask if we fucked . how 's that , tee ? is that `` the money '' ?

why do n't i just wait three weeks and tell her i was cleaning out my wallet and found her number ...

you want to come with us to a party at the chateau marmont ? they got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies .

... and even then ...

... not until you book it ...

did you , um , did you get that pilot ?

charles ! what 's up , man ?

i know what you 're saying , man . i do n't know what to tell you ...

... i heard it took four days to light for that shot ...

i have n't heard an official `` no '' yet .

well , no harm done . this is lisa . i 'm sorry , i never got your names ...

i believe it too . he really just wants her to be happy .

lisa works at the mgm grand ...

always ...

i 'm a comedian .

no thanks . why ruin a perfect night .

you have to lay it on the table .

i understand .

six years .

why not ?

oh ? you know about booking agents ... i do n't , uh , actually have a west coast agent as of yet ...

why not ?

i can call back ...

... home . it 's getting late . yeah .

when i lived in new york they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport . i got off the plane in l.a. six months ago and all i got to show for it is a tan .

if and when i get a real gig i 'll call you .

yeah . and an actor .

i really want to catch up with you , but i 've got ta take this call . they 're holding . i 'll talk with you when you get back in town . bye .

yeah , uh , i do n't think that 's gon na be happening any time soon ... listen , can i call you right back ? i got ta take this call ...

no , he 's not ... listen i do n't want to talk about him . that 's a whole other headache . i called because i heard you might be moving back to queens ...

pierre ... that 's his name ? pierre ? is he french ?

it does n't matter . i think about you every day .

yeah ?

fine ... i guess . you ?

... six months .

how 's it going ? it 's been a while ...

by the way , the guys back home said she put on some weight .

because you left , man . she 's got her own world to deal with in new york . she was a sweet girl but fuck her . you got ta move on . you got ta let go of the past . the future is so beautiful . every day is so sunny out here . it 's like manifest destiny man . i mean , we made it . what 's past is prologue . that which does not kill us makes us stronger . all that shit . you 'll get over it .

see , it 's all how you look at it . if your life sucks , then mine is god awful . i mean , i moved out here partially because i saw how well you were doing . you got in the union , you got an agent . i thought if you could make it , maybe i could too ...

how am i doing well ? i host an open mike and i played a fuckin ' bus driver in a movie . big fuckin ' deal . i 'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians . how good am i doing ?

no . just o.j .

there are so many beautiful women here .

what 's that guy 's name ? sue ?

wait till summer . i swear , you ca n't leave the house . it hurts . it physically hurts .

i 've been around here six months and i still ca n't get over it .

i ca n't get over how cute the girls in this city are .

classy .

to get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven .

i 've decided to get out there . go ahead . play it out .

i do . good for you , man .

oh no ?

what ? like , you did n't want to jinx it ?

i do n't know . it 's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter .

it 's definitely a step back for me .

rob , i just want you to know , you 're the only one i can talk to about her .

ah , see , that 's the thing . somehow they do n't come back until you really do n't care anymore .

i mean first you 'll pretend not to care , not call -- whatever , and then , eventually , you really wo n't care .

well that sucks .

so the only difference is if i forget about her or pretend to forget about her .

the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back . see , you ca n't do anything to make her want to come back . you can only do things to make her not want to come back .

so what 's the difference ?

right .

right .

... yeah . you 're just gently batting it around ... and the rabbit 's all scared ...

... and big fuckin ' teeth ...

baby , do n't talk that way , baby ...

... but it 's worth the risk . true or false : it 's worth the risk .

that was pretty cold , dude .

you could make their heads bleed , though .

i do n't know . i guess kids were hitting each other or something .

because he 's a bitch .

chelios to roenick ... !

six .

two vodka martinis , straight up , shaken not stirred , very dry , easy on the water .

you owe the don a service . he has no doubt that you will repay it .

you owe the don a service . in one hour , not before , perhaps later , he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help . be there to greet him . if you have any objections speak now , and i 'll inform him .

yes , i understand . i 'm listening .

some day , and that day may never come , i would like to call upon you to do me a service in return .

america has been good to me ...

an eye for an eye !

and what is that bonasera ?

barzini is dead . so is philip tattaglia , so are strachi , cuneo and moe greene ... i want to square all the family accounts tonight . so do n't tell me you 're innocent ; admit what you did .

like hell i will .

the food is on the table .

ok , ok. you gon na make me something to eat at least ?

you 're staying home . you 're not going out .

you 're on , kid ... i 'll square it with mom your not seeing her before you left . and i 'll get a message to your girl friend when i think the time is right .

you take care of paulie ?

that 's all ? do n't you want me to send some people over here ?

how many times did he stay home the last couple of months ?

yeah .

we got ta fight sometime . let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength .

probably all the other families will line up against us . but , it 's alright . these things have to happen once every ten years or so ... gets rid of the bad blood . you got ta stop 'em at the beginning . like they shoulda stopped hitler at munich , they shoulda never let him get away with that , they were just asking for big trouble ...

what are you , a dance judge ? go do your job ; take a walk around the neighborhood ... see everything is okay .

my compliments . i 'll take care of them from my share .

it 's too late . all the contracts have been signed , they 're almost ready to shoot .

sure .

tom , i never thought you were a bad consigliere , i thought santino a bad don , rest in peace . he had a good heart but he was n't the right man to head the family when i had my misfortune . michael has all my confidence , as you do . for reasons which you ca n't know , you must have no part in what will happen .

tattaglia is a pimp . he could never have outfought santino . but i was n't sure until this day . no , it was barzini all along .

mention it , do n't insist . barzini is a man who will know that without being told .

when i meet with tattaglia 's people ; should i insist that all his drug middle-men be clean ?

now you 've had your drink .

yes .

my wife was weeping before she fell asleep , outside my window i saw my caporegimes to the house , and it is midnight . so , consigliere of mine , i think you should tell your don what everyone knows .

should i bring him in .

and with prison record .

is it necessary ?

what else do you believe in ?

yes , but sons who would be professors , scientists , musicians ... and grandchildren who could be , who knows , a governor , a president even , nothing 's impossible here in america .

i want children , i want a family . but i do n't know when .

will your girl friend get back to the city all right ?

what is it ?

even so , i do n't think it is safe here anymore . i 've made plans to move you to a villa near siracuse . you must go right away .

no ... i would like to walk to corleone .

michael , why must you do this . we have been lucky so far , all these months you 've been here we 've kept your name a secret . it is from love for your father that i 've asked you never to more than an hour from the villa .

hey , beautiful girls !

come sunday morning : my name is vitelli and my house is up there on the hill , above the village .

this was a beauty . right , calo ?

i know about what you mean !

you had better bring a few bottles home with you , my friend ; you 'll need help sleeping tonight .

tom , you 're the consigliere ; you can talk to the don and advise him .

mike , you sure about moe selling . he never mentioned it to me and he loves the business .

mike !

that 's for you to find out .

mike ! the party starting !

well it 's war ! we might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time consiglere , a sicilian . pop had genco , who do i have ? hey tom , hey ... hey . it 's sunday , we 're gon na have dinner . do n't be sore .

no more stalemate tom , we got the soldiers , we 'll match them gun for gun if that 's how they want it . they know me for what i am , tom -- and they 're scared of me .

no . our informer in mccluskey 's precinct . tonight at 8:00 he signed out for louis ' restaurant in the bronx . anyone know it .

and when they shot me father ...

the other families wo n't sit still for all out war .

we should hear what they have to say .

was there a definite proposal ?

ok forget it , just stay on the phone .

luca never sleeps over with a broad . he always goes home when he 's through . mike , keep ringing luca 's number .

mama , no .

will you give this to him .

an accident . no one was hurt .

i 'll try ... it 's what the don would want us to do .

he never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first . understood ?

let 's say now that we have to kill mccluskey . we 'll clear that up through our newspaper contacts later .

right .

is it true ?

michael , it 's not true . please tell me .

connie and carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy .

wake me up when you come to bed ?

no , you eat ... do n't wait up for me .

when will i see you again ?

when will i see you again ?

michael ?

then we can have dinner , see a show , and spend one more night .

for dinner . unless i call and tell them we 're still in new hampshire .

tom ... tom , i 'd like you to meet kay adams .

i never know when you 're telling me the truth .

michael you 're trying to scare me ...

michael ...

al capone !

then eat your spaghetti and i 'll tell you a luca brasi story .

yes . tell me .

we do n't have to disconnect them , we can wheel the stand with the bed .

you 've read about my father in the papers . you 've seen that no one 's here to guard him . now i 've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him . believe me and help me .

you and i are going to move my father right now ... to another room on another floor ... can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out ?

probably a year ...

cut it out .

i do n't need them , sonny . i 'm just going to see pop in the hospital . also , i got other things .

to the city .

christ , if i could only contact luca .

what guarantees can i give you ? i am the hunted one . i 've missed my chance . you think too highly of me , my friend ... i am not so clever ... all i want if a truce ...

i want to settle things tonight . i want my father left alone .

i 'm glad you came , mike . i hope we can straighten everything out . all this is terrible , it 's not the way i wanted things to happen at all . it should never have happened .

i do renounce him .

yes , i promise .

you son of a bitch , you think you can brush me off like that ? i made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders .

is that why you thought you could slap freddie around in public ?

is my credit good enough to buy you out ?

do you recognize my voice ?

yes please !

oh , it was .

i do n't like you .

marge , you like everybody .

marge , ripley 's saying goodbye .

uncanny !

what ?

i 'm actually a little relieved you 're going , to be honest . i think we 've seen enough of each other for a while .

tom , i do n't love you .

yesterday you 're ogling girls on the terrace , today you 're getting married . it 's absurd .

how ?

marge and i are getting married .

i 've gotten to like it . i 've gotten to like everything about the way you live . it 's one big love affair . if you knew my life back home in new york ...

i knew it ! i had a bet with marge !

then i 'll take it as a compliment .

i mean it as a compliment . you 've got such great taste , i do n't know . most of the thugs at princeton had tasted everything and had no taste . used to say , the cream of america : rich and thick . freddie 's the perfect example .

why ?

why are you asking all of a sudden ?

i 'm suddenly quite happy to be going back .

to mongi . you 're cheerful tonight .

i 'm not going to say anything -- to marge , or anybody , the police -- it 's a secret between us and i 'll keep it .

what 's the fight about ? that 's her fiancee , is n't it ? are they blaming him ?

is freddie here ?

freddie drove me back in his car .

get undressed in your own room , would you ?

freddie miles . you know -- he 's organizing the cortina skiing trip .

relax . the most important question is where to eat . i hope freddie made a reservation .

it 's just there 's so much to do in a single day .

i love how responsible you are . my dad should make you chief accountant or something . let me buy you a jacket . there 's a great place when we get to rome , batistoni .

what does he say ?

no !

no , no brothers , no sisters .

your handwriting -- nothing more naked . see -- nothing 's quite touching the line -- that 's vanity .

it must be a deep secret , cause i do n't know about it .

pretty vile . see this : the s and the t , do you see ? -- fine , vulnerable -- that 's pain , that 's secret pain .

i love the fact you brought shakespeare with you and no clothes . ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night . is that true ?

what ?

sure . i love venice .

you 're doing great . we 'll make a sailor of you yet . you 're doing really well .

what time is it ? oh god ! do you always type your letters ? that should be two ts .

go back ! go back to new york or call him if you can find a telephone that works , and tell him wild horses would n't drag me back to him or his shipyard .

i do n't know , dickie , i 'm just telling you what i --

i feel like he 's here . horrible . like the old bastard is here right now ! that 's brilliant ! how do you know him ?

i like to sail , believe me , i love to sail ! instead i make boats and other people sail them .

forging signatures . telling lies . impersonating practically anybody .

you know , a primer .

okay . and did we know each other ?

who 's this ?

freddie , do you have something to say ?

no . no , i 'm staying here for a few days , in rome . that 's a new piano , so you prob --

he 's gone to dinner ! search the place . i ca n't think why you would imagine dickie would hide from you .

who is it ?

marge , good morning . unusual weather .

i 've always wanted to go to europe , sir , but ...

could you ever conceive of going to italy , tom , persuade my son to come home ? i 'd pay you . i 'd pay you 1000 dollars .

tom ripley . thank you , sir .

i do n't know , i do n't know , i just know it .

what a waste of lives and opportunities and --

you do n't want to , dear . i 'd like to talk to tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon ? would you mind ? marge , what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he 'll admit to another fellow --

pretty good . sticking with hot water .

i 'm sure we 've met .

i hope she never knows .

why do i think there 's never been a ripley rainy day ?

what are you going to do now , tom ?

but i hope that note goes to new york in your purse , for a rainy day .

i do n't believe you .

marge ? where are you going ?

marge , calm down , you 're being hysterical .

let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this .

you 've got dickie 's rings .

what ?

i found dickie 's rings .

marge , i 'm in the bath . wo n't be long .

tom ?

tom .

hello peter , so good to see you .

no , well go if you want to , but do n't talk to the police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he 's got a temper -- he could 've hit freddie . good luck , marge . i 'll catch up with you later .

marge , when did you get here ?

he was there with someone . so i suppose she must have dragged him -- that 's not fair . i 'm going back to mongi . i think dickie 's coming home . i 'm going to go home .

no . hello , i 'm tom ripley .

is he here ? are you with dickie ?

he hates being confronted .

search me . i guess we 're abandoned .

errand number one -- deliver marge 's perfume . errand number two , pack some clothes and his precious saxophone .

i 'm fine .

my fiance .

i absolutely agree with marge .

how would you know that ?

marge , i do n't know you , so i have no right , but dickie loves you . he 's -- i think you 'll find he 's coming home to you .

dickie ? do you know dickie ?

this is spectacular .

where 's dickie 's father ?

i think we sort of found each other .

no glasses .

dickie , are you with peter smith- kingsley ? i bet you are . my aunt thought she saw him .

you know what -- i am .

so -- are you travelling under r ?

i have n't been hiding . i 've been in police custody . they 've been trying to flush out freddie 's killer .

exactly . 10.30 --

c'mon , i need to talk to you . just the two of us .

i 've left marge , meredith . and mongi . so the rat 's here now , in rome .

what ?

but you 're going skiing with us yankees , are n't you ?

emily . just kidding .

which is ?

dickie , dickie greenleaf . hello .

a ragione . a ragione .

are you a homosexual ? interesting non-sequitur .

ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor greenleaf , il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor miles .

... tom is a mystery ...

i lied . to her . she thought she 'd seen you .

hardly kissing . kissing off .

all kinds of things . making plans .

hello . what are you up to ?

nothing .

but you 're still tormented , you must be , you 've killed somebody ...

il signor ripley ha una fidanzata , il signor dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor freddie miles ha molte fidanzate .

no .

i do n't know how to translate that . e difficile ... il signor ripley ... dormiva all'aperto , con un ...

you 've seen the papers , you know what a big deal it 's been here . american tourist murdered --

no , but i thought that did n't happen in italy , that each region was completely separate ! i was sure that was the --

anyway i 've got to the bottom of the delay . finally . we 're waiting for someone from rome .

it 's okay .

welcome to venice . this place reeks , does n't it ? can you smell it ? ugh . sorry . not the best way to spend your first day .

we 'll be there .

tomorrow 's possible . do you know dinelli 's ? piazza di spagna ?

no , i have and so has miss sherwood , ask her ! and if i could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the goldoni ! -- tom was staying at the goldoni .

you have , yes .

i 'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends .

i think i just said . ripley was handling some business for me , nor does mr ripley want to marry me . nor did he ask me every day if i would marry him . and when .

31 people .

it 's not a pattern , it 's a coincidence . there must be fifty hotels in san remo , there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day .

no . here is a pattern . two days ago freddie miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered . yesterday a little boat is found in san remo full of rocks , and the owner tells the police it was stolen on november 7th . we look at hotel records and we see oh ! dickie greenleaf is staying in san remo and then our boatman remembers two americans taking a boat .

no !

i do n't remember the exact date .

even her .

postmortem ?

i can get you front and center . what do you like ? i can get you mets , knicks , rangers ? hell , i can get you the mayor 's box .

they 'd never get me to go back . they 'd have to shoot me first . you got anything to carry these in ?

it 's hell out there all right . a real shit-eatin ' war . i 'll say this , though : it 's bringing a lot of fantastic guns . the market 's flooded . colt automatics are all over .

sure , here , take this card , go to this place and give 'em the card . they 'll charge you , but there wo n't be any hassle .

you ca n't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother ?

the .32 's $ 150 -- and you 're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to , ah , seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster . hell , i 'll give you the holster , we 'll make it seventy-five and you 've got a deal -- a good one .

you got a .44 magnum ?

hello , travis .

no , i do n't feel so good . we 're just two very different kinds of people , that 's all .

i mean porno movies .

well , i do n't follow movies too much ...

where are you going ?

kris kristofferson .

what hours do you work ?

i know . i could have picked you up .

what did you do ?

he 'd been shot . i did n't know that . he just crawled into the back seat , said `` west 45th street '' and conked out .

yeah , well ... in a cab you get to meet people . you meet lotsa people . it 's good for you .

i can believe that .

my name is travis .

i do n't know ...

why ?

well , then , what is it you exactly want to do ?

well , we 're all working tonight .

if you do n't mind , mam , i 'd rather work for you .

yes , mam .

oh , i think he 's a wonderful man . make a great , great president .

charles palantine . the man you want to volunteer to help elect president .

with the other hand , right ?

well , if he had been italian , they could have been shot off . sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson , if they blow a job or something .

what taxi driver ?

no , why ?

have you been noticing anything strange ?

that 's the last . the finish . period . some people can learn . some people ca n't . and you wonder why we never get serious --

alright , now . you want to know why cbs has the highest ratings ? you think their news is any different from nbc , abc ? it 's all the same news . same stories . same order usually . what , you thought they had good news for people , right ? you thought that 's why people watched cbs ? i 'll tell you why people watch cbs . cronkite . the man . you got it ? not the news , not the issues , the man . if walter cronkite told people to eat soap , they 'd do it . we are selling cars , goddamn it .

i think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program . push the issues .

the senator 's white paper is almost ready , bets . should we wait for that ?

what is your name ? my name is travis .

and the kid says , `` yeah . she 's about 19 , good-lookin . '' mccall says , `` what can i tell you ? ''

that 's the guy . eddie calls him up and says , `` hey , what do you want me to do . i 'm over here at poly prep . i got a girl in the back and she does n't have the fare . she wants me to come in back and collect . what should i do ?

for a fee .

for a fee .

fuckin ' mau mau land , that 's what it is .

you run all over town , do n't you , travis ?

yeah . we went to harvard together .

well , i said , `` lady , please , we 're on a bridge ... ''

what did you do ?

yeah .

well , whatever the fuck it is , she used it . and then the spray perfume . you know , the real sweat kind -- and , on top of that , get this , right when we 're crossing the tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose !

the kind with a brush .

first she did her make-up . you know , i hate it when they do that . i mean she does the whole works , the mascara , the eye-shadow , the lipstick , the rouge ...

i have .

i 'm sorry , iris . i did n't mean that .

cops do n't do nothin .

what should i do ? call the cops ?

i ca n't say -- it 's top secret . i 'm doing something for the army . the cab thing is just part time .

besides , i 've got to stay here .

that fella `` sport '' looks like a killer to me .

where is home ?

i was stoned . that 's why they stopped me . when i 'm not stoned , i got no place else to go . they just protect me from myself .

do n't you want to go ?

i musta been stoned .

why should i want to get out of here ? this is where i live .

ca n't you listen to me ? do n't you want to get out of here ?

you tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- sport -- would n't let you .

no .

why ? who are you ?

what 's your real name ?

that ai n't much of a name .

well , he should clean up this city here . it 's full of filth and scum . scum and filth . it 's like an open sewer . i can hardly take it . some days i go out and smell it then i get headaches that just stay and never go away . we need a president that would clean up this whole mess . flush it out .

i do n't know , sir . i do n't follow political issues much .

we hire a lot of moonlighters here .

military record ?

listen , son , you gon na get smart , you can leave right now .

yes .

got your license ?

look , um , if you give me your name and address , we 'll send you the information on how to apply .

what kind of guns do you guys use ? .38 's ?

why ?

why do you ask ?

are you a secret service man ?

no . hillbilly , you 'd better get your wise ass outa here and quick , or you 're gon na be in trouble .

i 'm here to see iris .

how are things in the pimp business , hey sport ?

funny , you do n't look hip .

thanks .

look , a person does a certain thing and that 's all there is to it . it becomes what he is . why fight it ? what do you know ? how long you been a hack , a couple months ? you 're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in .

sometimes it gets so i just do n't know what i 'm gon na do . i get some real crazy ideas , you know ? just go out and do somethin .

look , ah , we never talked much , you and me ...

what 's the action around ?

some fleet driver for bell just got cut up . just heard it on the radio .

travis .

carla pestalozzi ? no . definitely not . you could have posed for the mona= lisa . sophia loren looks swedish next to you .

hey ! now there 's some good news .

that record company.in nashville wants to hear my demo tape .

could we change the subject ?

not really .

what is happening ? where 's mason ?

my girlfriend 's pregnant .

st. michael 's church , fort walton , kansas . front pew . right leg . = hollow .

surprise , surprise .

the cell , mason .

you referring to your intellect , goodspeed ? or another portion of your= anatomy ... .

i 'm not the chemical weapons expert .

i 'll go .

do n't shoot me . mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder ...

where is he sir ? right in front of me . what 's he doing ? he 's on the= phone . i do n't fucking know , his stockbroker ! oh shit . got ta go .

during the time i cooperate , will i be outside ? outside a jail ?

i do n't understand ... .

and who 's gon na run the projector until you get back ? mrs. terwilliger ?

whatever happens .

i am , too .

forget about all that . you want to do the right thing ? then defend your name . if someone says something about you that 's untrue , you have to stand up and say so . i know the law , and the law 's on your side .

hi .

hi .

i had it , a minute ago ...

you mean , me ?

... including me . right ?

he does n't remember anything , delly . does n't know how he got here , does n't remember his father , the town , the bijou , anyone ...

yeah , well it 's not everyday you get news like this . you 're sure he 's okay ? other than the bump on the head ?

no ... i ca n't ... i have to ... i ca n't ...

what ... do you remember ?

it never used to be . you were two left feet on the dance floor . like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step .

thanks .

how do you tell those two apart , anyway ?

we 've done this before , so many times . the last time was so long ago , but it feels like yesterday .

oh ...

i 'm sorry .

actually , i was married . for four years . but ... well , we did n't fit together . i 'm divorced now .

whoa .

after they commissioned it , no one could ever agree on where to put it . the methodists wanted it in front of the methodist church , the presbyterians wanted it in front of the presbyterian church , the city council wanted it in the lobby of city hall . everyone finally got tired of the fighting . so they stuck it down here .

of course , there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here .

you must not remember anything . come on .

city hall ?

are you now , or have you ever been , a member of the communist party ?

we see it . for the record , it reads `` lucille angstrom . '' what 's the point of this ?

start with what you knew then .

referring to line thirty-seven of the document , does your printed name and signature appear there ?

mr. clyde , i remember everything .

sir , are you referring to the fact that i was suffering from amnesia , and i 've since recovered my memory ?

and what is the state of your memory now ?

mr. chairman ... there 's ... another amendment ... that i 'd like to invoke at this time , but it 's not the fifth amendment . i wonder if you 're familiar with it .

the witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee , as long as it 's the truth .

the chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today , mr. appleton . we certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee ?

peter kenneth appleton . hollywood , california .

be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record .

well , son , you 're home !

by all means .

no wallet , huh ?

i do n't know what else to tell you . i was n't hiding out . i hit my head and i did n't remember anything until a few days ago .

the bijou ?

c'mon , i 'll give you two a lift back to the bijou .

or the bijou . either one .

well , he loves the place . it 's his home .

and i hear you and harry are planning on re-opening the bijou .

i 'm not happy about this , mind you , but if i have to go , at least i 'm going in my own bed , the same bed my lily died in , and ... knowing that my son is alive . that 's not too shabby , is it ?

a few .

i 'm here .

i know , i know ... keep still .

the film broke ...

oh , no , i ...

they 're ...

yes ?

well ...

i 'll be home in a little while , harry . do n't wait up .

son , i think you loved the bijou even more than i did . you 've got to remember that . you 've got to .

`` eight p.m. showtime , ninety-six admissions , receipts including concessions , $ 84.75 ... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs . ''

they could n't wait to see you .

mother . she 's beautiful .

did n't you have any help ?

we 've been closed for a while .

wait 'll you see the inside !

you never came back from the war . we were told you were missing and presumed dead .

pete ... go home . come on , i 'll call that girlfriend of yours , what 's her name ... sandy ?

you should watch what you say . you do n't know who 's listening .

zackly .

the g-man ?

pete . you think maybe you 've had enough ?

that 's where you live .

what is it ?

well , you 've been wet to the skin . you must 've fallen in .

uh , no ... just seeing you standing there , it reminded me ... there 's a word for it ...

what 's wrong ?

evening , luke .

take a hike . am-scray .

here 's three months rent , and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place . now , i need a moment alone .

thirty a month .

would n't blame him if he was .

jesus .

what , all of a sudden , `` lucille angstrom '' is n't a name ?

what do you mean ?

cigarette ?

peter , do n't let that stop you all of a sudden .

that 's not the country luke fought for .

and i wo n't be a communist anymore .

the fbi ca n't arrest you , because you have n't done anything wrong .

`` ashes to ashes ? ''

exactly .

so , you 're saying that it 's true . you went to a meeting of a known communist organization .

no , i ...

cat . that 's simple . i like it . hi , cat .

no .

is there a young tim ?

oh .

please , sit .

sure . come on in . i was just packing .

will you help me , sandy ?

that you got let go .

thank you , mr. lawson .

said as much myself , doc . ca n't place him , though . to look at him , you 'd think the cheese slid off his cracker . well , morning 's half-over . i 'm off .

mabel over there at the diner lost her husband max . okinawa , i believe .

ernie cole here just got himself elected mayor . lost both his boys in the war . kenny at anzio and willie at normandy .

they all know you ?

you look familiar , fella . what 's your name ?

actually , my grandpap . but `` ancestors '' sounds better , do n't it ? here .

no . no , not miss sinclair . i 'm talking about adele lardner .

ohhh . oh , the poor thing . he probably lost his way in the dark .

then go .

do you think i should go ?

it seems so pointless . i think i 'll go to sleep . this has been a busy day . my luggage .

i 'll be going , too , to help out . it should be fun , melanie .

i 'm sorry . forgive me .

i see .

no , i do n't think so . she 's not afraid of losing her son , you see . she 's only afraid of being abandoned .

then why did she object to you ?

and what had you done ?

with lydia . did she seem a trifle distant ?

when was this ?

how 'd you happen to come here ?

i despise it .

how do you like our little hamlet ?

or would you rather i changed the subject ?

i 'll get it , sit down , miss daniels . do you want a sweater or something ? a quilt ?

yes .

it 's utilitarian , i 'll say that for it .

sure . you can have it . where 's your bag ? in the car ?

i would appreciate it . i 've tried everywhere in town , and they 're all full .

i guess that 's where everyone meets him .

it 's a nice drive . is that where you met mitch ?

did you drive up from san francisco ?

thank you . it gives me something to do with my spare time . there 's a lot of spare time in bodega bay . did you plan on staying long ?

no , not really .

are you a friend of mitch 's ?

which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place . did you want to see cathy about something ?

that 's the one . cathy brenner .

just listen to them !

well , mom , he 's the first to admit it . he spends half his day in the detention cells at the hall of justice .

do n't you like bodega bay ?

mitch ? do ... do you think they 'll be all right ? in the trunk ? can they breath ?

why are they trying to kill people ?

i do n't know , honey .

mitch ? why are they doing this ? the birds .

can i have the boat in about twenty minutes ?

that case , i tell you what you do . you go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there . not the motel , that 's the other end of town . this is the hotel . now you take a right turn there , you got that ?

where would i get a boat ?

i did n't want to come right down the road , where they could see me .

the front door . is n't there a back road i can take ?

yes , but where ?

right here . bodega bay .

good morning .

birds are not bad !

what good 'll that do ? smoke 's as bad as birds .

why not , mrs. bundy ?

i did n't even know there were many crows in bodega bay this time of year .

we do n't have any fog this time of year , mitch .

i do n't think it 's that serious . you want to sit up here ?

shall i call the doctor ?

here 's your pie , sebastian . you want it at the table ?

we 'll worry about that when we get there .

if they are ?

they wo n't be .

if ... if ... when we get to san francisco ... if they 're already there ?

but they 'll be back .

you 're doing fine .

mother ! i 'm trying my best ! i 'm ... trying ... my ...

what happens when we run out of wood ?

i do n't know yet . i think we 'll be safe here . let 's bring that wood in .

not now . not while they 're massing out there .

maybe we ought to leave .

i do n't know .

when do you think they 'll come ?

tell him about the party .

i know exactly what i want , mother .

i know , mother .

yes , mother .

i know , mother .

no . i only led her into believing i believed she was ... mother , it 's really very complicated .

she was selling birds .

yes .

yes .

i 'll pick you up , miss daniels . where are you staying ?

oh . i see .

melanie daniels . melanie , my mother .

please .

please do n't mess me up with bandages , mrs. brenner .

that 's the last of it .

then i do n't suppose it 'll matter much to anyone but me .

why , mrs. brenner ?

would you like to rest now , mrs. brenner .

i 'm not this way , you know . not usually . i do n't fuss and fret over my children . when frank died ... you see , he knew the children , he really knew them . he had the knack of being able to enter into their world , of becoming a part of them . that 's a rare talent .

i wish i were a stronger person . there is a long awkward silence . she sips at her tea reflectively .

try not to think of that , mrs. brenner .

no .

yes , i 'm sure she 's fine .

al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm .

oh , thank you .

now hold it , mitch . you do n't know that for a fact .

did n't know how he got in there . had a broken leg , turned out . just fluttering all around there .

i do n't think i get you , mitch . do about what ?

what are we going to do about it , al ?

not by the thousands .

yes . yes , someone 's got to feed them .

he wo n't be back until monday . i mean , if those birds are for him ... .

is that for mitch brenner ?

can we turn back ?

mitch ...

the power .

how about you ?

you must be exhausted .

it may not be last week again for a long long time .

the bay does n't .

i got here as fast as i could . where 's cathy ?

mmm ?

and all the while , that sparrow was getting in his little messages . birds of the world , unite !

hear , hear !

not at first . oh yes , a few sparrows out for kicks ...

certainly , of birds .

it 's an uprising .

last night ? what do you mean ?

no , tell me .

i have an aunt , you see . aunt tessa . she 's seventy years old , and veddy prim and strait-laced . she 's coming back from europe at the end of the month , and i 'm going to give her a myna bird that 'll talk to her .

on mondays and wednesdays , i work for the travelers ' aid . at the airport .

like what ?

i have several jobs .

why do you have to rush off ? what 's so important in san francisco ?

i do n't give a damn what you believe !

like jumping into a fountain in rome !

why ?

but you tore it up .

i wrote the letter .

yes , i was lying .

and you did n't come up here to see her .

yes .

i 'm neither poor nor innocent , but the truth of that particular ...

without any clothes on ?

i guess she and i read the same gossip columns .

how does mother know what i like to do ?

san francisco 's a long way from here .

will i be seeing you again ?

oh , yes .

hi . annie had no plans , huh ? i 'm glad you came . are you hungry ?

with ... with annie , of course .

you are , are n't you ?

i 'm sorry . i could n't possibly ...

none of your business . am i still bleeding ?

what did it say ?

to see a friend of mine . will you please be careful ?

what for ?

only violators and practical jokers .

is that why you 'd like to see everyone behind bars ?

do you practice here ?

what do you call your lovebird story if not a practical ...

do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window ?

but how ... how do you know my name ?

all these innocent little creatures caged up like this ?

those are canaries , miss . does n't this make you feel awful ?

do you have a pair that are just friendly ?

i understand completely , sir .

lovebirds , sir ?

lovebirds .

immediately . is this the daily news ? melanie daniels . would you get me the city desk , please ?

no , you 'd better send him . may i use your phone ?

they said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon . if you 'd care to come back ...

i think maybe you 'd better deliver him . let me give you my address .

yes .

and he 'll talk ?

i know . oh , i know . i 've been calling all morning . oh , you have no idea . miss daniels , they 're so difficult to get , really they are . we get them from india , you know , when they 're just little chicks , and then we have to ...

i was hoping you 'd be a little late , miss daniels . you see , he has n't arrived yet .

maybe they 're all protecting the species . maybe they 're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and ...

does n't it seem odd that they 'd wait all that time to start a ... a war against humanity ?

i thought not . birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx , miss daniels ; a hundred and twenty million years ago !

for what purpose ?

these were n't a few birds .

birds are not aggressive creatures , miss . they bring beauty to the world . it is mankind , rather , who ...

thank you . do you know dan fawcett 's number ?

they 're both perching birds , of course , but of quite different species . the crow is brachyrhynchos . the blackbird is cyanocephalus .

no , the birds did n't attack until the children were outside the school . crows , i think . i do n't know , daddy . is there a difference between crows and blackbirds ?

how can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke ?

how ?

i only know we 've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away .

i like bodega bay as well as any man . if i thought ...

no . i do n't , mitch . because i ca n't see any reason for it .

the point is that no one seemed to get upset about it . they were gone the next morning , just as if nothing at all had happened . poor things .

they made some mess , too , smashing into houses and everything . they always make a mess . we 're better off without them .

that 's right , sir , i recall it . a large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town , where all the lights were .

... probably contain more than a hundred billion birds !

kill them all . get rid of them . messy animals .

they are incapable of organized warfare !

we need them .

probably herring gulls . they arrive in november , you know , and do n't migrate north again until march or ...

how many gulls did you count , mrs. bundy ?

ca n't you please finish your drink ?

take it easy , lady . there is n't a bird anywhere in sight .

i have n't finished my drink .

there , master fettes . sooner than we had expected . a stoke of luck one might say .

but ca n't you give me any idea ?

that 's right . gray , the cabman . i 've had a bit of dealing with macfarlane in the past , you know .

mr. gray ?

i 'm very pleased to know you , master fettes .

i 'm donald fettes .

ask this one favor --

i want you to help my little girl .

where can i find him ?

he 's not home .

i 've heard of it .

gray has no need to threaten . you remember the trial ?

but that 's long since . gray ca n't threaten him with that .

is it a great man whom gray can order to his bidding ? is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that i must play maidservant for the world 's sake and his success ?

you must leave this house .

hold that lamp up -- i must see her face .

this is not a woman !

you 've no thought of going there ?

gray -- i 'm rid of him --

what 's that you say ?

no .

confound me , the child 's a cripple , of course she wants to walk . child , i say to you get up out of that chair and walk .

i suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor .

when she 's ready you bring her to me -- i 'll show her how .

wait , doctor -- wait ! the child 's fainting .

who would believe that ? and you know , someone else might recognize her . she was as well known as the castle rock .

i am sure . i mean to report it . it 's like burke and hare all over again .

but you did promise .

really , fettes , you irk me with your lack of understanding .

she came again today . she wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate . she feels you are her only hope .

and that 's why you do n't want to be a doctor , fettes ?

i saw the woman whose son 's body was delivered last night .

but richardson ?

you 're too good a man , fettes -- i 'll not let you quit . i 'll make an assistant of you -- that 'll pay your keep and your tuition , too --

one should n't get used to the wrong things , georgina . you want to walk and run and play .

he was a nice horse .

not yet .

your son , ma'am ? he must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so .

he 'll not leave the grave -- not since wednesday last when we buried the lad .

but then i would n't have the fun of having you come here and beg again , toddy .

i would make you rich .

what i was going to say is this -- would n't you be more comfortable at leith in a neat little house ?

so , toddy , you 've made me a disease , eh ?

wait , toddy . that 's not hospitable . i want to discuss business .

i brought you something tonight , macfarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition .

would you grudge me a glass with my old crony , meg ?

but what makes a thought start ?

the heart pumps it .

i am a doctor . i teach medicine .

maybe there 's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours . say that you 'll do it for me and my friend , mr. fettes , here .

you ? why ? since when have you become the protector of little children ?

why do n't you do it then ?

afraid of what ?

well , then , doctor macfarlane -- although i 've known a time , toddy , when you liked the name . aye , and many are dead now who called you by it ; rough and wild ones they were , too . but come toddy , sit down here with your young friend .

we could do that . but when he had them there , then what ?

i never heard that song . but what did they do ?

burke them ?

you mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together ? dig them up ?

i know that you kill people to sell bodies .

yes .

i presume you shall . this wo n't be my last visit here .

but she must be able to move . everything is in place .

i 'm not heartless , ma'am . i have every sympathy for you and for the little girl , but if i were to consent to every operation brought to me , i 'd have no time for teaching -- and that 's a great responsibility upon me , ma'am -- a great responsibility .

there 's nothing i can say for one small child ?

you 've been with gray again .

he must leave me alone .

fettes -- where is fettes ?

no great lady will ever take my place ?

and why not ? he 's a good lad -- bright and able .

it was one thing her dad rejected you . but when she did you lost it .

see , i heard you were looking for some guy with a scar . how 's that going ? you find him ? yes ? no ?

i believe they call it a connoisseur 's club . owned by delt .

we 're getting there . because in his so-called construction job , tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called `` the hole . ''

yeah . i sure will .

this is not just some `` thing . '' it 's a c zero zero five .

there 's no scar . corvis made it up .

big bang , primordial ooze , divine hand of a benevolent creator ? all possibilities . although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator .

sssshhh . she 's resting .

the scar .

i was talking about you .

are you out of your fucking mind ? we 're going to die .

not my arm ! what you fucking want ?

erin . i 'll always be with you .

all i knew , she was pulling away . it made me crazy .

have to find him first .

this tree . here 's where it happened .

no . you do n't .

it 's all my fault . oh god . i wish i were dead .

no ...

are you ok ?

my dad was right ! he said you 'd ruin her life .

i told you , i knew your sister .

stay away from me ! dad ! dad !

you 're a friend of the guy who killed her , are n't you ? you almost sound like him .

your father gave them to both of you .

i know her friends .

i was a friend of your sister 's .

doubt is a motherfucker .

how about sign of a big black bird ?

sign of the dead come back to life .

fucking crow .

could say that .

some hooker phoned it in . there was a riot at his apartment yesterday .

tommy leonard . the eyewitness in the corvis case .

shut up .

yeah , we do .

i watched her grow up . just like you . i know how her mind worked . she kept snooping around because she was worried about you . what you 'd gotten yourself into . so stop blaming me . and blame yourself .

please . come inside .

they killed her because she found out .

you killed her !

it still does n't mean ...

what 's that supposed to mean ? he was right here . he was !

watch out !

erin !

honey . i just ca n't .

yes , sir -- it certainly does !

thanks -- i 'm enjoying it right here .

something dramatic -- but not destructive . it 's quite an interesting problem . would day after tomorrow be all right ? say about noon ?

why do n't you leave it to me ? i 'll think of something .

what about your personal safety in the meantime ? what about the army -- and the police ?

that 's what i came to see you about .

what -- what sort of action do you mean ?

i gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful .

what i have to say must be said to all concerned . it is too important to be entrusted to any individual .

i came here to warn you that , by threatening danger , your planet faces danger -- very grave danger . i am prepared , however , to offer a solution .

we want to be sure you do n't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake . we know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children ... you see , we 've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years . we discarded instruments like this many centuries ago . so long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned . but soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets . that , of course , we can not tolerate .

i find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another . i understand you 've called a meeting to study our space ship .

you wrote this ?

he gave these to you ?

bobby -- ! what are you doing up at this hour ?

okay .

aw , gee , mom -- i had plans to play with mr. carpenter .

of course , dear .

come on , bobby . time to go to bed .

boy , we had a swell time . did n't we , mr. carpenter ?

why -- the light in my room went out . thank you , bobby . goodnight .

i 'll say goodnight again .

thanks , mr. carpenter .

all you have to remember is , first find the common denominator -- then subtract .

mr. brady 's a cop .

bet they 're worth about a million dollars .

some places that 's what people use for money . they 're easy to carry -- and they do n't wear out .

gee -- those look like diamonds !

certainly . tell me , bobby -- do you have to have money to go there ?

no -- i 'm afraid not .

bet he 's the only one in the world knows the answer .

it 's a problem in celestial mechanics .

what does that mean ?

bobby -- i have an idea . let 's go see professor barnhardt and find out how he talks .

mr. carpenter -- what does velocity mean ?

i do n't know , bobby . i 'm inclined to doubt it .

maybe four thousand miles an hour . and outside the earth 's atmosphere a good deal faster .

he lives here in washington , does n't he ?

and the lungs are the same as ours . must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure . how old do you think he is ?

i tried to make you understand . the suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust -- surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power --

not very good news , i 'm afraid . the president accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night . let me read you some of the replies . `` the premier wishes to inform the government of the united states that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the president unless the meeting is held in moscow . '' `` the suggestion of the president regarding the possibility of a meeting in moscow would be unacceptable to her majesty 's government at the present time . representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in washington . '' well -- there you have it .

i 've been dealing in earth 's politics a good deal longer than you have . goodnight , sir .

i will make that recommendation to the president . i must tell you in all honesty that i 'm extremely dubious about the results .

i intend to explain . to all the nations -- simultaneously . how do we proceed , mr. harley ?

you must have a rather strange impression of us .

this is not a personal matter , mr. harley . it concerns all the people on your planet .

i 'm afraid , in the present situation you 'll have to learn to think that way .

i 'm sure i do n't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise . had you been traveling long ?

just klaatu .

you do n't understand . you do n't realize how important it is .

tom -- i 've been trying to get you all afternoon --

you think it 's all right for you to stay here ?

bobby and i have had enough excitement for tonight .

i wonder if we ought to --

you ready ?

the boss is leaving for chicago tomorrow . if i could tell him i was getting married -- with two dependents --

you know how i feel , tom . i just want to think it over .

there 's always somebody here , but today of course they 've all got plans .

well , we could --

i think i 'm very lucky . you do n't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it .

how long will i live ? that no one can say .

i -- i thought you were --

hello .

where are you going now ?

i can see no other hope for your planet . if the meeting should fail , then i 'm afraid there is no hope .

what happened ?

may i see you for a minute ?

oh -- hello --

oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions . bobby and i tried to see professor barnhardt in the afternoon , but he was n't in . apparently they thought i was looking for secrets of some kind .

warm and friendly and intelligent -- you know -- he 's the only real friend i 've made since i 've been here .

he has his homework to keep him occupied .

bobby 's the only person i know who is n't -- jittery .

jittery is the word .

well , he 's not here . and he wo n't be back till this evening . i think you 'd better leave now . unruffled , klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad . he tears off the piece of paper and hands it to hilda .

we came to see professor barnhardt .

how did you get in here ? and what do you want ?

how dare you write on that blackboard ! do you realize the professor has been working on that problem for weeks ?

no -- no , thanks .

there are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world .

they can tell right away . they 've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital . take him over to g2 .

how long will that take ?

they would have killed this man ?

it 's really quite simple ... the three- body problem , you know .

but i suppose you know the answer .

well ... we blew plan a .

burn rubber does not mean < u > warp < /u > < u > speed < /u > !

he 's a vampire alright .

ca n't stand light ?

yeah , you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad , huh ?

how do you like santa carla ?

just passing through santa carla ?

the baddest !

two down and two to go .

did you see that sucker burn ? !

that 's just the way we like it .

they pulled a mind-scramble on us , man ! it was n't our fault ! they opened their eyes and talked !

we unraveled in the face of the enemy !

the prince of darkness .

santa carla has become a haven for the undead .

you 're one of us , now -- are n't you ?

do n't ! stop !

what ? ...

no , star . put it down . put it down .

you ca n't kill me , star .

look .

no . stick around .

the dun goes down and they 'll be comin ' for us .

what happens in tow and a half hours ?

we do n't have one yet . and we only have two and a half hours to come up with one .

vampires , my friend . vampires .

well ... he only shows up at the store after dark . and today , his dog attacked my mom . listen to this . from < u > vampires < /u > < u > everywhere < /u > ... 'vampires require a daytime protector -- a < u > guardian < /u > -- to watch over them as they sleep . for it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable . since they hold sway over animals , < u > fierce dogs -- the hounds of hell < /u > < u > -- are often employed for this < /u > < u > purpose < /u > . '

get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart .

now i get it ... you 're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money . you 're part of a cult .

this is just our cover . we 're dedicated to a higher purpose .

do you mind ? it was a real scary comic .

mom . i think we 've got to have a long talk about something ?

can we get a t.v . ?

when you ran away from home , hitch- hiked to berkeley , spent the night in golden gate park and begged for spare change in the morning ?

smells like something died .

will somebody please tell me what this is all about ! ?

it was all going to be so perfect , lucy . one big happy family . my boys ... and < u > yours < /u > .

max ... what are you talking about ?

no , no . just worrying about my boys -- as usual .

max ! what 's wrong ?

boy ! < u > somebody < /u > areound here sure has bad breath !

you 're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding .

yeah . runaways , mostly . they come from all over . attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean . lucy ... listen i know i have no right to ask you this ... but do n't look for another job just yet ... i mean besides being the best employee i have ... i think you 're cute .

i guess if i had my choice , i 'd like to do something that involves children . work with kids in some way . teenagers , maybe . and santa carla seems to be full of them .

you seem like a terrific guy , max , and i 'm grateful for the job ...

so , i 've met the one woman on the planet who 's going to hold my success against me .

not impressed , are you ?

you 're cute , max .

say hello to thorn .

i 'm not looking for a tape . what i need is --

lucy .

michael invited me in . never invite a vampire into your house . it renders you powerless .

how about a little parmesan cheese on that ?

it 's gone . i feel it !

take laddie .

you 're not going anywhere ... sam ...

it 's not too late for you to be saved ... but each night ... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing ...

why not ?

not yet ... you 're like laddie and me ... half-vampires ... you 're not a full vampire until you 've made your first kill ... you were supposed to be mine ... but i could n't , michael .

do you know where david took me tonight , star ? do you ? !

no . they 've made me one of them , but i miss my family .

do n't be a baby . that did n't hurt and you know it .

are you hungry ? wan na get something to eat ?

michael 's great . i like michael .

i 'm michael .

what do you mean ?

if you want your ear pierced , i 'll do it .

okay . talk .

michael ! get behind the wheel .

it 's that girl from the boardwalk . is she one of them ?

what about mom ?

what about nonook ? what have you done to nanook ? ! what have you done to my dog , you asshole ? !

piss off .

then what 's the rush ? you 're chasing that girl , why do n't you just admit it ? i 'm at the mercy of your sex glands !

you 're beautiful .

okay . i 'll flip you for it .

this room is mine .

grandpa does not own a t.v . have you noticed ? there 's no t.v . santa carla has no malls , no cineplexes and now i wo n't even have mtv . i will not know anything hip happening anymore .

i 'm so excited i just ca n't hide it . i 'm about to lode control and i think i like it .

dogs do n't eat each other .

no . just that he recovered real quick ... that night when i found him in the rec room , he had already scraped off his bandage . before i put him with the others , i redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good ...

what do you mean `` got '' to the dog ?

look , i know it 's hard to believe ...

sure . you think there 's a connection ?

finish what ?

have you come across fuchs ?

watch clark .

... you think this thing wants to become an animal ? dogs ca n't make it 1000 miles to the sea . no skua gulls to imitate this time of year ... no penguins this far inland ... do n't you understand ? ! it wanted to become us !

no . just let him freeze out there .

he 's so close . maybe our best chance to blow him away .

could have been anytime . anywhere .

why did n't it imitate fuchs ? is n't that its number -- to get more recruits .

what 's it going to do , being a plant ?

what ?

you lying bastard ...

somebody 's taken it . i ca n't find it !

maybe we should n't make it .

load of bullshit .

now copper , you tie palmer up .

then kill me .

... nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline ...

oh , shit ! well , hang on !

what do we do about those three ?

how the fuck do i know ? !

what we going to do ? !

well , go on .

look , i 'm just guessing ...

the dogs ?

what 's happening ?

and if anyone tries to wake me ...

goes on like that quite awhile . what do you gentlemen make of it ?

bennings ?

a day or so ago ... i guess .

how far 's that ?

put that down !

one thousand volts . should be enough .

damn if i wo n't .

you 're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got .

i am going after them .

we 're on fire !

mac , where the hell is that pump ! !

and that was enough ?

then get a move on . childs , come with me .

oh , i got you . not too long .

how we going to try and find out who 's ... you know , who 's who ?

then we go after him .

forget about childs . he 's over .

what about childs ?

where was he trying to go ?

everything that 's been missing .

what is it ?

we got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply ?

you jerking off or just pissed ?

it 's got into the pub ! it 's turned on the stereo !

he came back screaming ... he never talked about it after that . i do n't think he even got this far .

i had a friend who came here once . sort of a dare .

the hall of books .

where ?

kalen ... do you have any idea where they take them ?

what else can they do ?

i 'm so sorry , kalen .

do n't tell me you 're a mud carrier .

i figured that . what kind of accident ?

go back to the light . you were n't made for this . i was ... i was made for this moment .

i 'm babbling . good to have someone to talk to for a change ... but you need to go . take her out of here ... ... i do n't have long .

nothing to do , i 'm afraid . i 'm just a librarian after all . was n't exactly made for all this swashbuckling . very byronic end , though . i appreciate that . do you know byron ?

takes a licking but keeps on ticking ... ... for a while anyway .

end ... ?

how are your dreams now ?

what do you mean ?

alexander ... listen to me , it was wrong to bring you . you 're not going to find what you 're looking for .

in for a penny , in for a pound . do you know that saying ?

kalen ... hold on a minute .

when was his mother taken ?

excuse me ?

because you 'll never die .

why should i help you ? you primates -- you great , lumbering , hairy animals , drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed ! a little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world ! you 're no better than the morlocks !

can you show us where they live ?

i am called vox ... ... now you are eloi .

i 'm tired of running .

i know .

that was a foolish thing to do .

no ...

after all you 've seen ... after man 's entire journey ... you still believe that ?

she wo n't remember you . none of them will . you will be forgotten . that is how history works .

we have lost the capacity to reproduce . but the species must continue .

i could tell them . warm them of what 's to come .

it ca n't all be like this ...

but this is barbaric ! have you completely lost all sense of --

i 'm afraid your indignation is lost here . i have no more `` human '' response to the eloi then you would have to a carrot . it 's just how we live now .

and what of the eloi ?

we make them see what we wish .

as slaves .

alexander .

it 's spectacular ...

the 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations , increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies . can i tell you more ?

i am the fifth avenue public library informational kiosk . vox registration ny-114 . may i help you ?

so it 's astronomy now , is it ?

i want to get into the light , that 's all . please ...

no ... let 's walk through the city .

let 's walk through the park ...

darling .

trust me ...

got here as soon as i could .

i need to ... um ... talk to you .

you promised me flowers tonight , do n't you even remember ?

when 's the last time you were outside this house -- -- or this room ?

why do n't you come to our house instead ?

you would n't believe me .

alex , nothing will ever change what happened , but --

do you find her ?

what happened to emma will never go away . it 's part of you now and it always will be . but you have to learn to live with it ...

hiding ?

you care for me . and you 're concerned . and i have to start living my life again . i hear it from mrs. watchit every day .

for god 's sake , david --

she made the best shepherd 's pie i ever tasted .

that 's how i knew we were destined to be together . when i met her parents for the first time i came right from class and i was covered in chalk . they sniffed and snorted , but she just smiled . at that moment -- i just knew . how did you know with molly ?

nothing .

you sound like my father ...

could n't help but overhearing . two fine young people starting out on the road of life . i wish you the very best .

please , i beg you . take him away from here --

yes ... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape .

i know what it is to lose someone . when my husband was taken from us ... i thought the pain would never end .

is it ?

yes ... after her death , it was intolerable for me here ... the future had to be better .

someone you loved very much .

this is where my journey started ... right here .

you know this ?

those rocks , over there ... they 're the same ... this is ... central park .

alexander ... ?

only to keep warm . for illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night .

did you have fires at night ?

... it was a great city . the greatest city in the world .

it 's always been this way here . we work on the towers all our lives . when we 're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors ...

it has no purpose . it 's just beautiful ... does everything have a purpose where you come from ?

i mean , why do you do it ? what purpose does it serve ?

thank you .

every night .

you seem fascinated by the stars .

i 'll take you to your machine tomorrow .

i 'm going to sit with kalen . keep the fire burning if you can .

i 'll take you tomorrow ... you must have seen a lot on your journey .

yes . or forward into the future . i suppose i really should check on the machine , see that it has n't been damaged ...

i might find the truth rather hard to understand ? ... can you go back ?

why not ?

why ?

then you can speak slowly .

your husband is dead ?

yes .

yes ...

you 're up ! you must be feeling better --

yes , sir , he --

then if emma turns me down will you marry me ?

now that 's more like it . you look a proper gentlemen for once .

oh huzzah , the master 's home .

and roosters .

imagine that .

what do you mean ? !

of course . you 're just tired . mara , will you look after alexander tonight ?

i 'm sorry , i did n't mean to ...

i am the oldest .

i did ...

you supported his application , dr. philby . you are his senior , advisor . i depend upon you to restrain his ... excesses . any repetition of the behavior i witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both .

kalen , look at me . there 's no one here but us . you see ... i 'm here , you 're here , alexander 's here . there are no morlocks . it was just a dream ...

kalen , it 's all right , i 'm here --

kalen ...

i do n't know what to tell you , sir . he 's been gone this whole week .

should we be what ? trying to change him any way we can ? [ beat ] yes .

should we be ...

you ok ?

it was part of the treatment i intended ... i did n't know what the effects would be ...

i know . [ beat ] i knew that when you came out .

no . i 'm not his son . i 'm him . [ beat ] what ? you look like you 've seen a ghost . you can come here and touch me , old man . i 'm the real thing .

you in here . [ beat ] works like a drug .

i 've managed to every sunday of my life . [ beat ] some of us are god- fearing men , starks .

it is . but when it comes down to it , you just have to patient with them . they 'd rather have their vacation , too , so they just push dealing with our `` practices '' off to the new year .

sit down , mr. starks ! sit down , mr. starks !

i had a patient a few years ago . his name was ted casey ...

you 're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition .

that was n't a fucking restraint .

[ uncertainly ] in that thing ... the jacket .

[ beat ] you do n't believe me , do you ?

i never touched your father ! i swear !

later . i 'll tell you about it later . we got a session to catch now .

what should they be looking for ?

they do n't care about all the things we do right . [ beat ] but they might ... they might care about what we 're doing wrong . [ beat ] that 's what they should come here to look for .

maybe it 's not such a waste .

yes . [ beat ] it has . everything up 'till today is done . everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs .

[ beat ] what do you need me to do ?

this is really happening , is n't it ?

what about dr. becker and mr. gries ?

why ?

i 'm doing fine .

how you doin ' ?

ok .

[ beat ] you be good to yourself , jackie .

good . how 's your mom ?

what ?

because your body can only take so much of what they 're putting you through .

[ beat ] i do n't know .

it 's not a prison , it 's a hospital . there 's got to be some way out of there and you 've got to find it ...

of course it makes me mad . it makes me more than mad . just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him . but what 's it gon na do for me to find them now ? i ca n't fix everything in three days .

i know . it was perfect . [ beat ] erase my sanity and you erase anything i 'll ever say .

they told me becker 's in shelbourne now . i looked him up and he was listed .

i do n't know .

you think lorenson kills you ?

i do n't believe a thing she just said .

alpine grove still exists . i looked it up on the net . we should go there and see if there 's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you .

i know .

i do n't know how you got the cut to your head , but you died bleeding from it .

i know what this is ... i picked you up when i was drunk and you probably thought i 'm just fucked up enough to fall for this . but the thing is i know what i 'm doing when i drink . i just usually do n't care . right now , i do though . and i want you out . now .

william starks is dead ... [ beat ] i 've been to his grave .

i 'm sorry for upsetting you , [ beat ] but i 'm not lying to you .

well , you belong in one .

jackie , i 'm william starks . i can prove it .

william starks . [ beat ] thanks .

[ beat ] in case you get lost , or ca n't remember who you are .

you 're just gon na walk ?

but i like it i guess .

you two ok ?

how ?

sure . it 's an easy address . a little far out there , but easy enough .

no . listen to me ... the kid , eugene ...

i did ?

how ... how do you know ?

because i do n't have time .

[ beat ] like who ? like mackenzie maybe ?

what about the world ?

no , i do . that 's what i 'm saying to you .

you have no idea what 's going on .

[ beat ] we will .

well ... [ beat ] let me know how your search turns out .

so maybe dr. becker would know . [ beat ] but , as i 'm sure you know , the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities .

my dad wrote some things down before he died .

i was working with a boy named eugene .

you thought my father was crazy ?

i never knew my father . did you ?

you were convicted of the crime .

and if i did n't want to come ?

i 've been here for 11 years . it 's my neighborhood . 'course i 'm sure . he 's as drugged up as the rest of us ... i guess he has to be to put up with all this .

no . [ beat ] i mean i found out while i was in it that my body 's gon na be found in four days .

oh no , you 're pretty young . your body 'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think ...

[ beat ] how do you know ?

[ gravely ] no , i mean in four days , i 'm supposed to die .

[ cutting in ] mackenzie , listen to me . listen . i 'm going to die .

i was n't talking about anything .

yeah , well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy .

yeah , guess so . how 'd you know ?

hey , mister , you need a ride ?

i doubt it . [ beat ] i do n't think prison 's so bad you do n't want to remember it ...

so you never knew your mother ?

they told me i joined the army when i was seventeen . that 's when my father died and , before that , it was apparently just me and him since i was born 'cause my mom split .

well , good for you .

yup . that 's me .

nothing . [ getting up ] thanks for bringing me this far .

great . that was our last option . what am i going to do with you ?

no . [ beat ] not around here .

[ beat ] i was dropped off .

i do n't think so .

you do n't have anywhere to stay ?

let me ask you that again . this time , look around and consider your options .

i 'm not sure .

good .

see ya .

well then , it 's a good thing you 're not regional manager and i am .

no , thelma , i do n't give a shit what we have for dinner . i may not even make it home for dinner . you know how fridays are .

uh-huh .

have a good day at work today .

hon .

i got ta go to little rock .

well , maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids . i 'm sure i could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children .

now that you mention it , they might have been a little bit jumpy .

that 's thelma dickinson 's husband .

it 's a nightclub , not a drive-in , hal . i do n't follow the customers to the parking lot .

you did n't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving ?

no !

i do believe you . that 's what i want everybody to believe . trouble is , it does n't look like an accident and you 're not here to tell me about it ... i need you to help me here .

weird . got some kind of snowball effect goin ' here or somethin ' .

somebody 's butt is gon na bar-b-que .

oh , great .

is this the guy you saw them with ?

the important thing is not to let on that you know anything . we want to try and find out where they are . now i do n't want to get too personal , but do you have a good relationship with your wife ? are you close with her ?

what kind of gun was it ?

stop it ! goddamnit , i mean it ! louise is gon na wonder where i am . let go !

it 's okay . i 'm married , too .

your name 's harlan ? i got an uncle named harlan !

i may be the outlaw , but you 're the one stealin ' my heart .

well , i was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin ' i was good at so i ...

well , i robbed a gas station once , and i robbed a couple of liquor stores , and some convenience stores . and that 's it .

you 're a bank robber ?

twenty-four is n't young . i 'd already been goin ' out with him ten years when we got married . i 've never been with anybody but darryl .

did you get married real young ?

ask me no questions , i 'll tell you no lies .

jimmy ! hello , stranger . what in the world are you doin ' here ?

damn , jimmy , did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff ?

believe me , the last thing i want is for you to get punished .

are you just doin ' this to punish me ?

'cause , louise . i do n't want to lose you . and for some reason i get the feelin ' you 're about to split . permanently .

alright , alright . i 'm sorry .

maybe .

jimmy , my daddy 's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that ...

who is it ?

oh my god ! jimmy ! you ... oh my god ! what are you doin ' here ?

hey , peaches .

that 's the code word . i miss you , peaches .

what ?

peaches .

and what 's the mysterious code word ?

no , honey . i told him i was buyin ' a car . what is it for ?

okay .

i know . call me back . louise , i love you , okay ?

no , for that much money i have to tell them exactly which office . i know , i 've had to have money wired to me on the road . and there has to be a code word or they wo n't give it to you . i 'll have to tell you the code .

louise , let me call you back after i wire it , so you 'll know which office to go to .

not yet .

i have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it . now i know you wo n't be able to get it out , but i 'm good for it . i need that money . can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and i 'll pay you back ? please , i 'm desperate .

are you in town ? this sounds long distance .

as far as i 'm concerned , yes , ma'am , you are .

is this your car ?

go ?

what are you talkin ' about ?

we 're not giving up , thelma .

all this for us ?

god ! it looks like the army !

what in the hell is that up there ?

how do you stay so positive ?

there 's one thing you oughta understand by now , thelma , it 's not your fault .

why ?

shit !

shit !

yup .

you know what 's happened , do n't you ?

texas ... you were right about what happened to me there .

you 're drivin ' .

i wan na get a job . i wan na work at club med .

we can live in a hacienda .

you awake ?

well , let me know when you figure it out .

and we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive .

eeuww .

no , louise , you said the first part . i said all the rest .

i said all that ?

what ?

are you alright ?

well , i figure if you take a state policeman , shoot up his car , take his gun and lock him in the trunk , it 's best to just get on out of the state if you can .

i know it 's crazy , louise , but i just feel like i 've got a knack for this shit .

sorry !

please , god , please do n't let us get caught . please , please , please ...

we should have just ignored him .

oh , christ . i hate this guy .

look ! look who it is , thelma . i 'll be darned . what 's he doin ' way out here .

this is so beautiful .

i mean , look how different he looks just since high school . it 's bad enough i have to get old , but doin ' it with darryl around is only gon na make it worse . i mean , i do n't think he 's gon na be very nice about it .

you know those little dogs you see people with ?

now what what ?

i just told him if he ever gets to mexico to look us up . i asked him not to tell . i did n't think he would tell anybody .

let 's get it over with .

besides , what do we say about the robbery ? no excuse for that . no such thing as justifiable robbery .

but it was n't ! we got away ! we were walkin ' away !

murder one ! god , louise , ca n't we even say it was self-defense ?

holy shit .

you know , louise , you 're supposed to be my best friend . you could at least be a little bit happy for me . you could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life i have a sexual experience that is n't completely disgusting .

thelma , please get a hold of yourself . you 're making a spectacle .

oh , thelma . oh , no .

nothing . why ? do i seem different ?

well boy , he 's got his work cut out for him now , do n't he ?

i did n't ask him to come ! it 's like i said , thelma , he just loves the chase .

that 's puttin ' it mildly .

wait . what ? you want to go to mexico from oklahoma and you do n't want to go through texas ?

i just do n't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride . did you see his butt ? darryl does n't have a cute butt . you could park a car in the shadow of his ass .

louise .

i do n't know . i wo n't be .

call him ?

i 've been tellin ' you that for the last ten years .

you talked to him ? ! is he mad ? did you tell him ?

you could help me try and figure it out ! i got ta figure out what to do , and you could try and help me .

what do you mean ?

just what the hell is wrong with you ?

if you were n't so concerned with having a good time , we would n't be here right now .

tell them what ? ! what , thelma ? what do you think we should tell them ?

i do n't know , thelma ! i do n't know ! just shut up a minute so i can think .

shit ! i ... i , which way ?

ready when you are .

exactly .

i wonder if jimmy 's gotten back .

maybe .

well , i 've had it up to my ass with sedate ! you said you and me was gon na get outta town and , for once , just really let our hair down . well , darlin , ' look out 'cause my hair is comin ' down !

thelma !

is n't this fun ?

whose place is this again ?

neither do i , thelma , but darryl does it , how hard can it be ? i 'll see you later . be ready .

okay . i will , too .

i do n't know . warm stuff , i guess . it 's the mountains . i guess it gets cold at night . i 'm just gon na bring everything .

what kind of stuff do i bring ?

what time are you gon na pick me up ?

not this weekend , sweetie , she 's runnin ' away with me . hi . what 'd he say ?

no , i 'm callin ' from the playboy mansion .

you mean you have n't asked him yet ? for christ sake , thelma , is he your husband or your father ? it 's just two days . for god 's sake , thelma . do n't be a child . just tell him you 're goin ' with me , for cryin ' out loud . tell him i 'm havin ' a nervous breakdown .

yeah feels like it .

amen to that .

christ , ted , i was only four towns away .

i do n't know about this , dom .

they told me they do n't help out stalkers . look , maybe they 're right , it 's been a long time .

so that was it ? one bump in the road and you gave up ?

i do n't know .

well once . mary .

what 's the point ? let 's face it , dom , i 'm in a slump . lately i 've been feeling like ... well ... like a loser .

a convention ? how 'd you see her at a convention ?

oh come on , why would i lie ?

why do n't you be a gentleman and ask rosey ?

no , thanks . love a little bundt cake if you have some !

he can tell you 're an animal nut . you are , are n't ya ?

this is a good one , mare . sounds like his partner 's all lubed up .

hey , love will make you do fucked-up things .

why did n't you just tell her the truth ?

hello ... ? sully ... ? sully , that you ?

bet your ass you are . now i do n't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit . you got ta learn how to bend a little or believe me ... you 're gon na break .

i 'm worried about you , man . you better learn to have a pop once in a while or you 're gon na fall off the wagon . you 're being a fanatic and that ai n't healthy .

relax , he just ate .

tell bill to get the fuck off !

okay ? with this pad , the killer wheels ? looks like you really cleaned up your act .

very nice .

i say none of us leave this room until our young mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants . now mary , i know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us .

woogie , please , you 're starting to scare me .

no ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

how 's my stomach taste , she says . hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab , mare . sorry i forgot my wallet . i feel like a dog .

yeah ... i guess this is it , huh ?

harold and maude is my all-time favorite movie .

a fucking moron .

no . but the boston globe critic jay carr hated it .

you 're a movie buff ?

and it does n't cramp your style ?

when you look at architecture , try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism .

we will , but first i have a surprise .

the museum ? i thought we were going out to dinner ?

wow , i 've never seen him like this . he does n't usually like guys .

well it 's more of an enclosure really .

what 's that ?

i 'm kidding . yeah , i guess you could call me an architect -- it 's just a job really , a way to keep me moving . my real passion is my hobby .

well , just until i get my pga tour card .

i already know it , mary .

do n't you want to know my name ?

not in months . i do n't even know why i bought the damn place .

nepal ? have you been ?

a girl after your own heart , ted .

i do n't know what you 're talking about .

what ? ! you 're calling me a stalker ?

look , you asked me to follow your girl around , and i did and i started to like her , and then i realized i just could n't in good conscience do it .

answer the question , shitball .

what do you mean 'why ' ?

you fucked me , man ? why would you do that ?

hey , hey , hey !

japan ? what 's she doing in japan ?

okay , tell you what : i 'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from japan .

oh . i thought that 's not it anyway . i know this does n't make any sense to you , but i just ca n't turn it off that fast . i still feel something for her .

it 's a goddamn bunion . it 'll heal .

all the same , i still want to call her . i know it sounds crazy -- mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but , i do n't know , maybe i can help her out . the poor thing 's had it tough -- she 's in a wheelchair for godsakes .

yeah , this insurance business is too slow for me . i 'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai .

ted ? do n't you want the name of the housing project ?

anyway , the good news is i have all the information you need . got it from her bookie -- nice guy . you should definitely call her , ted . i mean she 's a real sparkplug , that one . she seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help i 'll bet she does it .

three different guys ?

really ? very , very ?

do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case ?

no .

do n't play games with me , ted .

oh ... sully .

ho-ly shit .

four .

why you son of a --

friend . baseball bat .

just dumb luck . i delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me . i went home that night , shaved my beard , and a week later i was laid out in her office with a broken back .

and you met mary how ?

... so then in '94 i went back to dade community college for a semester and when the wal-mart cashier job fell through i hooked up with the pizza barn .

bullshit !

i knew shit . the only thing i knew was that you were a fake and i made up everything else . my real name 's norm . i deliver pizzas .

you heard me , goddamnit . i ... i love her .

who ?

that stalker ted got to you , right ? you 're working for him , are n't you , you little shit ?

whoa , whoa -- i do n't know what you 're talking about .

did you build the estadio olympico ?

really ? but he 's been married for twenty years -- they 've got six kids .

the exercise tape ? sure , i 've seen it on t.v .

'that right ? good for you .

that must make it tough .

no prob , i could use the company . i 've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight .

i do n't want someone who 'll put up with him . i want someone who will enjoy him , the way i do . do you know what he told my friend tucker ? he said he would 've popped the question a lot earlier if warren was n't in my life . well he is in my life and i 'm goddamn lucky to have him . the hell with steve .

i do n't know , it was complicated . he 's in san francisco , i 'm in miami . besides , magda 's psychic dog hated him .

jeez , i do n't know where you 're ever going to find a guy like that .

you vicious bitch , how do you sleep at night ?

an old flame ?

knock it off , pollyanna , just 'cause you 're in love does n't mean everyone else has to be .

i 'm buying bananas tonight .

healy .

sure . uh , magda , why do n't you get some more cheese and crackers ... ?

i do n't watch the new ones .

that 's because there 's a lot of bad people out there . hey , puffy tried to warn you about that steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself , did n't you ?

i confirmed it on the scanner . i knew something was up because puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know puffy only barks at bad people .

you picked that up on the scanner . we got ta move .

neighborhood watch ? is that what you call listening in on stranger 's phone conversations ?

you mean he 's not a criminal ?

what ... ?

look , it 's just that something about him struck me as odd last night . he gave me this funny vibe . anyway , i called some friends back east . they do n't know of any architect named patrick healy and he 's not listed as a harvard alumnus .

what 's up , doc ?

hey , no kidding ? where are your offices ?

really .

you 're woogie ?

i did it because because i 'd never stopped thinking about you and if i did n't find you i knew my life would never be good again .

wait , hold on , mary -- it 's not as bad as it sounds . i certainly did n't know --

uh , mare , what kind of dog is puffy ?

um , ted , i need a moment with magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom .

look , mary , the truth is ... i 'll be in town for a while now but i do n't think we should see each other for a few weeks .

ted ... you 're not that far ahead .

we 'll see . if it does n't , what the hell , at least i gave it a shot .

ah , my roots here are too deep . i love my practice , the people i work with , warren 's got a nice thing going why do n't you just move down here and marry me ?

well ... why do n't you move back ?

that 's more like it . two more nitrate-sicles please .

sure .

on your ear , you 've got something .

hey .

mary , we have n't seen each other in twelve years . do n't make me wait another day .

i 'm kidding . i 'd really love to , ted , but the thing is i already have plans . how about tomorrow night ?

nope , nope -- dodged a few bullets . god , i can not believe i 'm standing here with mary jenson .

funny story . you see , me and a buddy of mine decided to ... ah ... you know ... just ... drive down .

no , it was a good thing . i mean , good in that it was very quick .

by the way , how 's he doing ?

oh yeah , healed right up . no visible scars .

oh my god ... ted . what are you ... ? i ca n't believe this . i have n't seen you since --

hi , ted .

a real clydesdale , huh warren ?

oh he can hold you . he weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds .

no , that 's really unneces --

you 're looking at him . c'mere and take a look at this beauty .

she 's a dental hygienist . she 'll know what to do .

just relax , dear . now , um ... what exactly are we looking at here ?

teddy , hon , are you okay ? oh heavens to pete !

charlie , that 's mean . come on in , ted . do n't listen to mr. wise guy here . he 's a joke a minute .

okay . so is that a yes or a no ?

yeah , so ... i 'm gon na wait and see what happens there ... but that sounds great , yeah .

it 's no big deal , whatever i mean , if you want .

so what 's up ?

good , ted . piggy back ride ?

how are you doing , warren ?

i do n't mind . if you think he can hold me .

yes , sir .

get out of our way , mr. secretary . the navy has been running blockades since the days of john paul jones .

starshells .

carrying out our mission , mr. secretary . if you do n't mind , we 're very busy right now . we need to be able to do our jobs .

tomorrow ...

and it can be relayed beyond comrade khruschev 's ears to the top circles of my government

yes .

yeah , but the country did n't even exist as a country yet . it was a mess , and he did n't have a leg to stand on .

what if i ca n't ?

jesus christ , guys . what the hell 's khruschev thinking ?

smoke .

slow down . smell that ?

he 's right . and things are happening too fast . it smells like the bay of pigs all over again .

it 'll be the principals , a couple of the key guys from each department : the executive committee of the national security council . we 'll call it excom .

they 're going to be pressing for a military solution soon . we ca n't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats . we need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here .

the other thing is ...

who gives a shit about the midterms now ? the soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us .

every day the sun comes up ... says something about us .

the sun came up today .

-- you listen to me . nobody , nobody , talks about my friends that way . you 're fucking here right now because of the kennedys . they may be wrong . they make mistakes . but they 're not weak . the weak ones are these 'people ' who ca n't speak their own minds .

jack and bobby are good men . but it takes a certain character , moral toughness to stand up to --

i just checked myself . they 're being issued identity cards . call comes , and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas . they go by helicopter to mount weather . we meet them there .

cuba .

and the second condition ?

i am instructed to tell you that the american government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed . if this solution were raised at the u.n. by ambassador zorin , he would find a favorable reply from ambassador stevenson .

does this attack on our plane represent a definitive , intentional escalation on the part of the soviets ?

then we have no choice . general , issue the warning orders to our forces . they will be prepared to execute the air strikes monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter . i 'll need the official release orders on my desk sunday night .

so which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world ? how do we work with them if there 's been a hard-line coup ?

all right . then i guess it 's time .

how long until the army is ready ?

is this the chiefs ' recommendation ?

no . i 'm glad i 'm home .

what happens to you ? i 'm not leaving without you .

when are you going to be home ?

why do n't you ask him yourself ? you can have him on the way home .

deal .

forget it , scotty .

i 'm doing a piece on skybolt . i hear macmillan 's meeting with him in nassau .

three weeks before midterm elections ? you need me .

i , uh ...

secretary of defense ...

what 's that ?

have to hope it 's a signal that he 'll back down on the real issue too .

we can horsetrade with khruschev on ships . but it does n't get us any closer to removing those missiles .

any problems , you remind them those chains of commands end at one place . me .

maybe it 's harder for them to say it than they let on . at the very least , they believe it 's in our best interest . and at the end of the day , they may end up being right .

i 'm gon na protect those pilots .

i 'm your political advisor , and i 'm giving you political analysis here . this is a setup . the chiefs want to go in . it 's the only way they can redeem themselves for the bay of pigs . they have to go in , and they have to do it right . it 's that simple .

in the morning i 'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room . mcnamara 'll set up shop in the flag plot at the pentagon , keep an eye on things there .

no choice . this is going to cost lives any way we go . do nothing , and it could be 80 million of ours . we have to get rid of those missiles .

you must think i 'm blind and stupid . i 've already gotten the birds and bees from bobby . the president does n't have to double-barrel me .

bob ?

sleep is for the weak , mr. president .

do n't get too attached .

mr. clear moon .

i see .

-- do n't `` man '' me , jimmy . where 's the key ?

that 's right . what are you doing here ? this is a religious ceremony you 're desecrating .

the main problem is , ray , these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders , non-indians . relations have not been amicable .

it 's not the first . there 's been several . and our field office in rapid city is getting a lot of heat ... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit .

good . thank you .

tell him , ray .

this was a selective operations unit , agent levoi . there is classified information pertaining to our national security . you do n't question that , you do n't go digging into that shit -- that 's insubordination . jesus christ --

why ?

well , she 's running now , too . these fucking people like to run , do n't --

i 'll sleep around a little .

i just wan na make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer .

your first homicide , that 's gon na happen , ray ...

genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings . an incontrovertible motive . and definite footprints on jimmy looks twice at maisy blue legs house .

whoever dusted leo , dusted him from the driver 's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the badlands . jimmy looks twice has never been behind the wheel of a car . it 's a known fact out here that he 's petrified of driving . his parents were killed in a car wreck .

the right man ? talk to me , ray .

her oil pan is shot .

alright . alright .

white eagle feather through the circle . that 's their symbol .

one of the leaders of the warriors of all red nations . militant organization .

i 've got the doer . i know who he is .

leo 's gon na need his hands , cooch . he does quillwork .

who the fuck is he ?

this is a restricted area .

no . i consulted it . we 're going into indian country , i wan na know what kind of individual is covering my ass . do n't you ?

you crashed my file ?

hey , hey , hey . j. edgar would 've loved you . he 'd love anybody who joined the bureau to , what was it ? `` to enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests '' ?

jesus ...

no , ray . you 're gon na have to blame that on your grandmother .

what about the water ...

he has n't left this place in twenty years . they got him .

he 's gone .

bullshit , let 's get outta here ,

ray . ray , do n't let go now , man . ray ...

we 're standin ' on broken treaty ground , ray . this ai n't supposed to be here . it 'll poison the water .

jesus . oil ?

ai n't prayer flags , that 's for sure .

i 'm a full-blood oglala .

nothin ' . forget it .

i ca n't , hoss . i do n't talk to fbi 's .

yeah . jimmy 's prints are there . but they cross over benjamin black star 's prints . and he was n't there until six o'clock the mornin ' after to get eggs from the chickens . so jimmy was n't there til the next day . follow ?

still after jimmy ?

what are you talking about ?

cuz i 'm a skin ?

cut the shit . you should n't be in here , man .

you ai n't no indian . you 're a sal mineo indian .

it 's not real .

what you call myths , we call our history .

-- no . no offense to the old man . i appreciate you trying to help . but i put my ass on the line coming out here , man .

heavy , heavy duty . taku wakan . wanagi spirits . it 's one of those few places we 'd never go to as kids . still do n't . some of the old people say crazy horse is buried back there . we have to go ray . together . like his vision .

-- leo fast elk was sitting in the outhouse at maisy blue legs when a car pulled into the yard . he came out , approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was jimmy . he tried to get back into the trailer , but the car came highballing at him . he started running for the open grass . with the car moving , jimmy hung his shotgun out the window , took aim -- missed once , hitting the shitter -- fired again , and severed leo 's spine . leo fell , rolled , and came to a stop in the grass . and some chicken feed . stale chicken feed with four days mold . electromagnetic printing .

do n't be mad . that was just an old traditional gesture that means hello , how are you .

the owl told him about leo . that 's incredible . i guess we just broke the back of this investigation , did n't we ? evidence does n't get any harder than that -- not for my money . is there anyway we can seduce this owl into federal court ?

and ...

he just did the gettysburg address in sioux . what did he say ?

what 's he smoke in that ?

he knows me ?

but he is not unhappy with you because he knows you .

what did he say ?

they 're sayin ' that nobody 's gon na talk to you cuz they do n't give away one of their own . but they did say there 's somebody way across the little walking river who wants to talk to you .

you 're an easy man to track , ray . ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on .

i 'm talkin ' his spiritual mother . maisy blue legs .

-- his mother never lived here . she was from up in north dakota .

is that right ? well , listen to this : drag your ass . this is a restricted area .

bullshit .

big sonuvabuck . based on the depth of that print , pressure releases ... i 'd say he goes two-ten , two-fifteen --

you 're steppin ' on sign .

your relatives must 've taught you something .

i 'm from minneapolis . fifth street . i did four years at dartmouth before i ever set foot on this res . so i know about the other world , ray .

you 're not gon na catch him . he can shape-shift into different animals . bear . elk . porcupine .

yellow bird ... is gon na sing .

what are you doing on the reservation ?

-- your father was part sioux .

do you want a coffee ?

red deer table ! what 's with you , man ?

what 's tashka sha , speak english , speak english !

you turned leo over on his face . but the coyotes must 've turned him back over , man , cuz his spirit is out . it 's out , and it knows .

they sent me here , richard because they said you did n't hold up your end of the arrangement , and i have to transport you back to leavenworth .

get up !

no . ca n't say that i have , richard . richard do you know why i 'm here ?

no , that was leavenworth . this -- was sioux falls . what ya want ?

since i got a iron pipe put across my knees , man . fight with three wasi'cus , ya know .

i think i have ... i could be wrong . i have been before . just remember one thing . if you 're not top gun , if you 're not fighting jets , you 're not gon na be able to act like a fighter pilot ... you 're gon na have to act like the rest of us . you 're gon na have to master humility . for you guys , that 's the toughest maneuver of all .

hey , i never said i was a fighter pilot ... i never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm . i can find contentment in a good book . i do n't have to roar by someone at mach two with my hair on fire . sometimes ... i just get happy being with the right man .

how could you ?

long distance ? i would n't do that to you . i 'd at least talk to you .

and that 's one !

that was n't fair . it was a question . penalty round !

what does it mean ?

what truth ?

you 're crazy . that 's a pretty silly game .

it 's strip reality , actually , like what the pilots always want to play .

i sit . i think . i play games .

everything passes . immutable law of the universe .

only when you 're depressed . then it passes .

of course the line 's just imaginary . you can cross it twenty times ... nothing really changes .

where are we ? you know where we are . it 's called the beach . it 's where life first crawled up out of the sea . i come here sometimes ... when i feel like crawling back in .

where are we ?

the dark side . the price you pay for all the fun you 're having . you knew about it , of course . did n't you ?

this is it , then .

where 'd you get it .

just good luck .

danger ?

you always get what you want ?

i always wanted to fly ... ever since i first saw a jet . i wanted to fly jets , then i wanted f-14 's , then i wanted to fly off carriers , then i wanted top gun .

all you 've got is one life . i guess it 's worth about the same to every body . you ever see an old woman after her husband has died ? and the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead ... when you 're in the air and doing something really dangerous , you can look ahead ... maybe ten seconds . that 's your whole future . that 's as far as it goes . but imagine what those seconds are worth .

winston churchill .

you know what really scares me ? living too long . losing my hair and my teeth ... and my guts and my wind . and my brains ... sitting in a room with my hands in my lap , watching daytime tv .



why 'd you do that ?

let 's make it at eight .

i 'm starting to sense that now .

i 'm different .

how about anything , anything you want to do .

you have to shoot him down ... .if he 's smart , he 'll turn away before that happens .

what if he 's not ?

uh hum .

is that all ? charlie what else do you want ?

you know , i 'm assigned to this school . i see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks . your attention is flattering , but not really productive . why do n't you keep your mind on flying .

no .

i 'm with someone .

i heard of one once .

yeah , most likely .

i could be , too .

it is n't ?

uhhh ... anything i can do for you ? she laughs again , does n't know what it is ... could be chemical , but she 's instinctively attracted .

sir ?

sir . i was going mach point one five .

i 'm upside down . i know it . i 'm gon na eject .

no joke , cougar . on the level . even i would n't do that to you .

you better not be ragging me ... if you 're flying upside down ...

you 're crazy . we 're level .

what is ?

bring it left . bring it left , you 're high .

help me with this one , i 'm really screwed up .

what is he doing ?

what do you want ?

is it you ?

the plane is fine .

just relax .

got ta go , man .

swell ! passing ten thousand !

yawing right .

bandit at seven o'clock low -- solo . take him . pull on the goddamn stick , man !

so , you 're scared -- so what ? you ever get a good look at me in the back seat , i 'm goddamn terrified .

if i could fly like you i 'd have everything i want . if i could fly at all . i ca n't fly . i ca n't fly like that . nobody can . whatever it is , you 've got it !

saving them some paperwork .

we 're here because we 're the best flyers in the wing . not because of some mig encounter .

did what ?

what was that ?

you think you can stay up with us .

mister to you .

no shit . the iceman ... .

who 's your pilot ?

something bothering you ?

i 've had enough ... for now .

come on , we 're next .

come on , we beat an instructor . how many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll ?

you see all those guys with gold on their shoulders ! ! ? ... oh , no , i think that was johnson , air boss of the kitty hawk !

ahhh ... a little high on the left , do n't you think ?

he should 've had me . goose take it down . let 's bug out of here . call for a draw .

great move . great

pay no attention to it . they 're just trying to rattle you . it 's all psychological . sit down..and drink .

nothing ... that 's mcgown ... that 's singer , is n't it ? goose turn around , pay attention . what are you doing ?

skipper , you ca n't do this !

thirty seconds . that 's all it took to blow us out of the sky .

no . you can be mine !

you 're a hell of a flyer . you can be my wingman any time .

you do n't owe me anything . we 're on the same team .

i guess i owe you one .

i got no tone . it might get you .

on the nose ?

look out !

no , i got him . i can take him .

if you ca n't shoot him , i can .

come off -- come off right . i 'm on my way in . you go free , i 'm engaging .

get lost !

fire , or clear out , ice .

shit ! !

engaging bandit 12 o'clock .

you like to work alone . i 've heard that about you .

he just wo n't engage . he ca n't do it , skipper . he ca n't get back on the horse .

morning , coogan .

did n't everybody ?

you won ? ! ! !

sir ?

kid , the plain fact is ... you are . i 'm not gon na stand here and blow sunshine up your ass . technically , they absolved you . you and i know what really happened . you pushed it . you are responsible and you 'll always carry that . you know what , i 'll carry it too . i should have taken you out of that cockpit . i guess i 'm a hopeless romantic ... i always try to find something worthwhile in someone 's death . it 's no trade-off . it 's not one for one . what you learned is n't worth his death . it could n't be . but maybe there is some value in it . i know it 's the first thing i 've ever seen that 's really gotten to you . now the question is , what will you do with it . if it gets you out of flight status ... so you do n't kill yourself or anybody else ... that 's good . that 's one good thing . you were an accident waiting to happen .

it 's not true .

they waved him off . he thought he knew better . he hit the ramp .

i did n't say that . that 's up to you . but i have responsibility for the other guys up there , not just you . they need to know you 're all right ... that they can depend on you .

i did n't know either . that 's why i told jester to prepare your papers .

i do n't know ...

all right .

then why are you here ?

big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane !

i had him in view . i was peeling over the egg , into a dive . he saw me when i moved in for the kill . there was n't any danger ...

yes sir .

what happened to number five ?

why not ?

well , there it is ; the last resort . sure you wan na go in ?

tell me something ; are all psychics , uh ... . ?

oh , the usual . more money , more freedom , more air .

he ai n't got five kids to feed .

i 'd advise you to hurry .

thank you .

nice to have you back with us , mr. brubaker .

i am quaid .

i did n't want it to end this way . i wanted hauser back . but nooo . you had to be quaid .

who gives a shit what you believe ? in thirty seconds , you 'll be dead . then i 'll blow this place up ...

what are you afraid of ? turn it on .

not true , he 's one of my best friends ... he 's got a big house and a mercedes . and you like melina , right ? well , you 'll get to fuck her every night. -- that 's right . she 's gon na be hauser 's babe .

who is it this time -- my mother ?

well , cohaagen , i have to hand it to you ... this is the best mindfuck yet .

we gave you lots of help . benny here ...

you see , quaid , none of my people could get close to kuato . the fucking mutants could always sniff us out . so hauser and i sat down and invented you : the perfect mole .

do n't be modest . kuato 's dead ; the resistance has been completely wiped out ; and you were the key to the whole thing .

i say we throw the switch and see what happens .

yes , sir .

but i thought ...

richter , do you know why i 'm such a happy person ?

come on ... put his head in place .

oh shit ... .oh shit ...

i 'm afraid that 's not possible .

i 'm with an very important client .

you better get down here .

i see . slipping away for a little hanky-panky .

so , been married long ?

it 's a symbol . of your desire to return to reality . -- inside your dream , you 'll fall asleep .

suppose i do ... then what ?

oh , i get it ; i 'm dreaming ! and this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me .

what do you want ?

o.k. , everybody pull out !

they found us ! everybody out !

yes , you do . that 's why we brought you here . -- cohaagen 's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain . and kuato 's gon na dig it out .

cohaagen found something weird inside , and it 's got him scared shitless .

if we do n't hand you over , everybody in the sector 'll be dead by morning .

relax , you 'll live longer .

you shoulda listened to me , quaid . i was there to keep you outta trouble .

are you crazy ? ! i do n't know anything about mars .

how did i get in this taxi ? !

i 'm honored .

you think i 'm an idiot ? remember our wedding ?

i swear to god ! ... i never saw you before six weeks ago ! our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh !

you call this a paranoid delusion ? !

i know it sounds crazy , but i went to this rekall place after work , and ...

i do n't know ! it had something to do with mars .

take it easy . tell me exactly what happened ? why would `` spies '' want to kill you ?

muggers ? ! doug , are you all right ? what happened ?

some men just tried to kill me !

well ... what do you say ?

there 's lots nicer places than mars .

just think about it .

move to mars .

do what ?

let me go !

but i 'm always home by morning .

tell me !

i do n't know .

is that better ?

i do n't wan na spoil it for you , doug . just rest assured , by the time the trip is over , you get the girl , you kill the bad guys , and you save the entire planet . now you tell me . is that worth three hundred measly credits ?

you . you 're the same . no matter where you go , there you are . always the same old you . let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself . i know it sounds wild , but it 's the latest thing in travel . we call it an `` ego trip '' .

come on , do n't bullshit me .

first of all , doug , when you go rekall , you get nothing but first class memories : private cabin on the shuttle ; deluxe suite at the hilton ; plus all the major sights : mount pyramid , the grand canals , and of course ... venusville .

that a problem ?

mars .

nice to meet you .

i just has a terrible thought ... what is this is all a dream ?

enough for everybody to breathe ?

aliens ? !

what reactor ? !

where are you going ? !

i 'm not sure dear ? what do you think ?

you two-faced-bastard .

oh , since when ?

just wondering .

by the way ... ever heard of a company names rekall ?

what are you talking about ?

i guess he did n't .

blondes .

i love you .

... who are you ?

wait !

what ? well , for chrissake , we could have made a stand at our place ! we had food , water ...

roger that .

good . you 've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail . so , here 's the plan : you and heather go for help . get to the mountains ...

rhonda . rhonda lebeck . she 's getting some kind of strange readings on her things .

damn ! val , we ca n't get them . never figured on having to shoot through dirt ! best goddamn bullet stop there is . come back .

i ca n't believe it . no tracks , no sign , no spoor .

miguel , the trouble 's come to us . if we 're not ready ...

right . we 're gon na run . get ready .

she 's got my vote .

jesus christ , we 're only going nine miles . be there in two hours , tops !

just barely , pham . what are you all doing up on your roofs . what the hell 's going on ? come back .

a beauty , is n't it ? we bought three of them for the rec room .

the mountains are solid granite . we 'd be safe there , and we could hike along them ... all the way to bixby if we have to .

well , at least the bastard ca n't climb . pardon my french .

you are so full of shit ...

somebody paying you to do this ?

sell the movie rights . we 're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar .

come on , you 're not going to do your lasso thing ... ?

well ... that 's it . we 're not getting off this rock ...

come on , everybody ! we got ta run for those rocks over there !

does n't matter . the cat can pull < u > any < /u > thing .

chuck him out the door ! like a little hors d'oeuvre .

shut it up ! shut the little bastard up !

i 'm gon na help you .

well , it 's not like we 've got a hell of a lot of options ...

well , folks , what 's the plan ?

son of a bitch !

well ... have n't seen a sign for hours . maybe it 's long gone .

god , the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones .

little sons of bitches .

we 'll take your word for it .

so this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime ?

this is one big mother !

what the hell are they ?

the rifle .

pham , we do n't want to be stuck on a couple of canners . they better be fast .

a man who plans ahead .

it must 've grabbed us . that 's why the truck stalled-out .

fuck you !

i am not !

jesus ! i do n't < u > believe < /u > this !

well , there 's sure as hell nothing to stop us now . everybody we know between here and bixby is already dead .

probably up a pole starving itself to death .

maybe he just could n't pull the trigger ...

if he did , why did n't he use his damn shotgun ?

i 'll call that little bluff . how close ?

we could . we could . but we 'd have to get < u > really < /u > serious . it 's gon na cost twice as much to rent a place .

why ?

you know , if you wanted , we could take a look at those seismographs for her .

who the hell 's that ? that 's not what 's his name ... the grad student ?

goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year .

no ... it was eggs . i did eggs .

if that ai n't the truth . and i count on them for a little bit of stew meat ... thank you , fred .

well , i brung her something i know she likes .

how 's she doing ?

we 're here , val . just tell us what you need . come back .

yeah , val .

down , honey , down .

ran into the new college student , rona .

you sure this is where it was ?

it 's ... gone ... !

the con ... ! oh my god .

i 'm dead . let 's finish in the morning .

those scumsuckers are my radials , pham !

i do n't believe this . the phone is out ! pham , your phone is out !

i think the ground 's getting closer . i think we do it . we 're gon na save our asses here !

listen , they only respond to vibration , right ? could n't we ... distract them somehow ?

like < u > what < /u > ? ! there 's nothing left that 'll make it to the mountains !

you guys do all the odd jobs .

what ? ! ! since when the hell 's every goddamn thing up to us ? !

what 's it doing ?

yes , see , they move very easily through the pleistocene alluvials ... ... the dirt ... the loose soil that makes up the valley floor . but they ca n't move through solid rock . i think we should travel west to the mountains .

right , geology . and you have to be val and earl . i 've heard all about you .

our own colombian connection ... for three years ... three years of ball breaking detective work . and we put a lotta bad guys behind bars .

he was your snitch .

and the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from shu 's gun ?

true .

gim me back my bottle .

i have to talk to your brother .

ms. vin 's sister .

complain to the bar commission .

so noted .

dowd . eddie dowd .

`` art 's supplies '' is founded on trust , mister --

i 'm a lawyer . the firm is thinking about renovating . everything dates back to the sixties .

what about entrapment ?

yeah , well i had reasonable cause to believe the judge might 've heard of the fourth amendment .

your honor , the witness ' response was non-responsive ... i ask you to strike it from the record ... !

we had information bearing on mr. kim 's desire to gain admission into the joe boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang .

exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place ?

how long did it take badalato to drive jimmy chin 's body from chinatown to the morgue ?

least we 'd already be at the morgue .

christ ... shu is innocent .

i 'm not that desperate .

-- eddie ...

george is a fucking burnout case . i did n't want him on the stand anyway . get more names from billy .

i feel much better now .

they 're just frightened , fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse .

-- you found his mugshot ?

`` have to '' ? no ...

do you have to do that ?

`` cecil stipe . '' find it .

a complaint follow-up form .

easy ? no ... we have to find some piece of evidence that got buried , to reopen the sucker .

what other case ?

kim got busted at 19 for burglary . at 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young chinese gang lord ... the prosecution claimed kim did it to get into `` the joe boys '' ?

right . you 're right .

of course .

right , i forgot ... we 're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the tri-state area . it 's an awesome responsibility .

pardon ... which dialect do you speak ?

-- me ? neither .

i need sleep . some of us are mere mortals .

eddie ... go home . get some sleep .

i have n't thanked you for your work , kitty . you 're doing good work .

a number of them are dead , three are in prison , one 's a waiter ... two -- you 'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the chamber of commerce .

but i like that theory . and since i 'm not putting twerp professor on the stand , and since i do n't have a better theory , i 'm sticking with that theory . meantime i want pictures of the joes . what 'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like shu to fool the eyewitnesses !

beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors .

-- how could i help you ?

it 's okay , eddie .

no .

maybe ... because someone 's afraid .

but why would a guy would do that ? paint black teardrops on his face ?

want to tell me what went down here ?

mr. rabin has no right to --

thank you , mr. stipe .

i did two tours in 'nam ...

hey , chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency .

oh come on , cecil .

see-cil . i 'm eddie dowd , this is roger baron . we 're lawyers .

we just discovered him , your honor ! his appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case ! he is an inmate at ossining correctional and --

objection .

to the best of your recollection , were you sober when you performed the tests ?

is n't it a fact that the `` six other asian men '' in the line-up were all of the classic mongoloid type , whereas shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a korean ?

i 'll prosecute anyone who fucks up . if that makes me look racist , it 's a trade-off i 'll live with , ed .

no , mr. dowd , you 'll see me in court . i 'm prosecuting this case .

we reconvict , your man 's looking at 25 years on two counts , served consecutively . so what i 'd like to ask , ed , is : are you joking ?

that 's right .

are you implying that my motives are less than sincere ?

back in the seventies i spent years putting away gangsters in a colombian syndicate called `` the ochoa '' . these guys are very dangerous , ed . when i hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys , i see red .

i 'm sorry if i 've ruined your day , mr. reynard . but my client 's had a rough eight years behind bars and --

this and that .

no -- leave him be . it 's better for everyone .

you getting this ?

look . mister --

... and you were at the trial to ... to see that justice was done ?

what do you want ?

mr. ortega , what is shu kai kim 's rank within la compania ?

if a member of the aryan brothers tries to cut in on your distribution ?

cigarettes , candy bars ... pcp , crack ...

and what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do ?

yeah , we do some of that .

for control of the prison drug trade ?

five years .

that guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy .

mr. stipe . a young man named jimmy chin was shot to death eight years ago , in chinatown . do you remember talking to the police ?

blonde .

you said , `` teresa banks '' , so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder ?

albert .

the very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association . the world is a hologram , albert .

no . never . you 'll have to kill me .

i want you .

no ... no , go away .

thanks , bobby . and my little round friends , too .

we can do it right here .

not tonight . just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow .

babe , i 'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product . put this cash in your safety deposit box ... it 's ten thousand dollars .

maybe our biggest . i 'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00 .

where were you for the last hour ? i 've been lookin ' for you ?

that 's why we 're here , sheriff cable . where 's the body ?

i 'm here to investigate the murder of teresa banks .

yep , it sure is .

is that agent desmond 's vehicle ?

can you tell me what their names were ?

an old woman and her grandson .

i am not going to cliff 's trailer .

that 's not the way to cliff 's trailer . i told you .

was there an argument ?

right . she had a friend with her . the friend took off .

you try that you little monkey .

got a map of the environs of the yakima indian reservation with your name on it . better bring a pole .

ok , gordon .

no , it 's oregon , portland , oregon . it 's regional bureau chief cole . out in portland oregon . i need you out here , chet .

chet , i am calling you from portland ... oregon .

albert , why tylenol ?

he 's gone .

tell me about the letter .

i cracked the whiteman case with this .

you are here and there is no place to go ...

the later events have never been kept a secret .

that would indicate that it 's the future .

someone else has it now .

where is the ring ?

sheriff cable 's already asked me a few questions about teresa banks . she worked nights for a month . that 's it .

he did n't suffer .

he 's dead -- good and dead .

what happened to her ?

how come jack let 's you work here ?

faulty wiring .

one thing that has been troubling me . that lamp at the diner . do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring ?

she 's wearing a ring .

she must have known someone .

in that case , we should go to the canyon trailer park .

are you speaking to me in a code ?

geez , agent desmond , it 's three-thirty in the morning . where are we going to sleep ?

that 's good .

gordon would not have sent us to deer meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation .

what did gordon 's tie mean ?

a blue rose .

the dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her . i noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in . it was n't her dress or she must have lost some weight .

what do you mean ?

code , i 've heard a lot about this .

cause i like it .

and i love you , too . but do n't wear my stuff .

but i love you , laura .

all my things have me in them . i do n't want you to be like me .

i feel so bad . i had nightmares all night long . they all knew you at that place .

no , i want to smoke .

yes , that 's what i want . thanks d .

call me anything just do n't call me late for dinner .

oh god , laura .

why are you suddenly so interested in who i am going to see at night ? nighttime is my time .

the usual , 9:15 .

thanks .

you graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen .

noooo ...

brother , i hear you talkin ' .

i did ? i did n't see anything .

you missed somethin ' , ed .

yep ... yes ... it is .

fill 'er up .

laura , no , i 'm not . i 'm not bob . poor laura . i wish i could help you .

bob is real . he 's been `` having '' me since i was 12 .

laura , you have to deal with all of this .

let 's go all the way .

bobby killed a guy .

you always hurt the ones you love .

everything , but everything .

what the hell is wrong with you ?

i 've got to see you .

james ...

yes , i love you . i 've told you , but it does n't really matter .

exactment . they are nuts about wood . they get goofy over trees .

trees ?

you 're getting warmer .

eating ?

i 'm not saying it 's right or wrong , it 's just the way i feel . it 's the custom thing i was thinking of . in america we do n't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides . we throw away the tail , the rest of the insides and the head .

i saw a guy eat a fish eye once in seattle . he was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat . i guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble . his throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing . and he could n't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still could n't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a heimlich maneuver . i went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy . they were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling . splat ! it just stuck up there and spread out . it was about the size of a half dollar . and that 's why i do n't ever eat fish eyes .

fish eyes ?

what are you afraid of ? what people think ?

ben asked him to stay late to plan for the norwegians .

mom ... what are you wearing ?

now hurry , dinner 's almost ready . your father says he 's starving .

i had to see bobby . i know you really do n't like bobby , but there was a problem and i did n't think you would understand .

what ?

laura .

laura . what 's wrong this morning ?

oh , i thought i saw you .

no .

yes .

dad ?

yes .

are you sure you 're okay ?

no , you have n't met him . have you met him ?

a friend from school .

but my name is n't leland palmer .

dad .

how do you know what she does n't like ?

leland ...

neither is mine . and ca n't we talk about something serious for a change .

soon . how about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about ?

i 'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you 're going to do it .

if leo comes here , he wo n't believe that i am out doing the `` meals on wheels '' .

come back as soon as you can .

good . you ever been inside a hospital ?

abrams . yes . how are you today ?

nothing .

she 's the only nurse who is n't testifying for the doctors .

i know that answer . if we went to trial would we win ?

if we were to go to trial , would we win the case ?

so what i want to do is stop it here . i 'm going to make him an offer . i want to do it myself . i want it to come from me .

... tell me about this case .

accused . not indicted . he resigned the firm . divorced nineteen seventy . galvin worked with michael morrissey until morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight . since then he 's been on his own . four cases before the circuit court . he lost them all . he drinks .

he was accused of jury tampering .

that was our insurance company 's recommendation .

because it struck me how neatly 'three ' went into the amount . two hundred ten thousand . that would mean i keep seventy .

we thought it was just .

they want to settle . it means a lot of money .

that 's the call that i 'm waiting for .

frank galvin 's ... who 's calling please ? bishop brophy 's office ...

... a mrs. doneghy called ... i told you that .

it looks that way .

... here 's your mail , call mrs. doneghy ...

after , after the operation , when that poor girl , she went in a coma . dr. towler called me in . he told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired , and he never looked at the admittance form . and he told me to change the form . he told me to change the one to a nine . or else , or else , he said ... he said he 'd fire me . he said i 'd never work again ... who were these men ... ? who were these men ... ? i wanted to be a nurse ...

i ... yes .

now . i 'd like to ask you something : four years ago , when you were working as a nurse , are you aware that drs . towler and marx based their treatment of deborah ann kaye on this chart that you signed ... ?

yes .

you would not ... ?

i would n't do it .

yes , we 've heard that . doctor : you testify quite a bit against other physicians ? is n't that right ? you , you 're available for that ? when you 're paid to be there ?

orthopedics ?

neurology ?

are you board-certified in anesthesiology , doctor ?

just as you are , sir ...

that is correct . i was engaged to render an opinion .

and you would come here , and on a slip of memory four years ago , you 'd ruin their lives .

... to get her heartbeat back ... ?

frank galvin . we 've met before .

objection ! this is ri ... expect us to accept a photocopy , we have the original right ...

my doctors did n't want a settlement at any price . they wanted this cleared up in court . they want their vindication . i agree with them . but for today the offer stands . before we begin the publicity of a trial . for today only . when i walk out that door the offer is withdrawn . as long as you understand that . it 's got to be that way .

... to save her and to save the baby . is that ...

yes .

well , we ...

that 's right .

she threw up in her mask . let 's cut the bullshit . say it : she threw up in her mask .

anything special about the case ?

you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth , nineteen seventy ...

what you thought ! ? what you thought ... i 'm a workingman , i 'm trying to get my wife out of town , we hired you , we 're paying you , i got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred ...

i swear to you i would n't have turned the offer down unless i thought that i could win the case ...

hold on a second .

you said you 're gon na call me up . you did n't call me up . who do you think you are ? who do you think you are ... ?

it 's completely done on a contingency basis . that means whatever the settlement is i retain one-third ... that is , of course , the usual arrangement ...

i doubt we 'll have to go to trial ...

... the archdiocese called up , they said who was our attorney , 'cause the case is coming to trial ...

i was telling your wife , we have a very good case here .

you sure you do n't want me to stay on .

yes ... i ... yes .

no , you did fine .

it 's my opinion it took him much longer . nine ... ten minutes . there 's too much brain damage .

cardiac arrest . during delivery her heart stopped . when the heart stops the brain 's deprived of oxygen . you get brain damage . that is why she 's in the state she 's in today .

these people play very rough . they do n't want to lose this case . there 's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear , i ...

i ... um ...

well ...

are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice ?

it 's a common medical term .

'code blue ' ...

then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men , to help a girl whose life 's not going to be changed in the least ? you know what code blue means ?

actually , yes . it 's by no means bad , i ...

they gave her the wrong anesthetic .

... page 414 , 'if a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement , general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask . ' is that what happened to deborah ann kaye ? she aspirated into her mask ?

'practice and methodology in anaesthesia . ' general textbook on the subject . is that correct ?

to do right . is n't that why you 're doing it ?

the hospital is owned by the archdioceses of ...

the most respected ...

i 'm sorry ... ?

her doctors killed her .

right . who called ?

... deborah ann kaye ...

that 's perfectly all right . i 'm kind of rushed . do you mind if we walk while we talk ?

i appreciate -- a man as busy as --

yes .

what did she say ?

kathy costello . that 's my maiden name .

kathy price ...

that 's a wonderful profession . my daughter-in-law 's a nurse . what did you do , stop ?

four . you 're great with these kids .

yes , mr. galvin ?

yessir . i 'm sorry .

no .

yes . we 've all got to let go .

no ... no ...

if i do n't 'grow up ... '

maybe i 'll tell you later .

well , then what are you doing here ?

you 're going to stay here ... ?

what ... ?

would you like me to leave ... ? is this a bad time -- ?

and is that what you 're going to do ? is that what you 're going to do ... ?

maybe i can do something right .

you just got lucky . d'you eat yet ? come on .

what if it was n't you that i came back to see ?

a brick house says you divorced him . i 'll put you on your honor . bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner . and i 'll take your word for it . now you tell me the truth . because you can not lie to me . what 's your name ?

yes . it was , actually .

i 'm a lawyer .

and what are you ? a cop ?

yes , we know that you do . i have it in my files . that 's at the manhattan health center ...

mr. alito , please .

well , maybe you better do that , then . you know you guys are all the same . you do n't care who gets hurt . you 're a bunch of whores . you 'd do anything for a dollar . you got no loyalty ... no nothing ... you 're a bunch of whores .

then why do n't you testify ?

who says that i 'm protecting anyone ?

who are you protecting , then ?

i did n't do it , mister .

nothing happened .

i 'll just take a minute . deborah ann kaye . you know what i 'm talking about . the case is going to trial . our chief witness is a dr. david gruber , you know who he is ?

i 'm joe galvin , i 'm representing deborah ann kaye , case against st. catherine laboure .

are we going to win ? we have , you know , other tactics , though ...

he saw her at the northern care ...

i do n't want to leave her . dick ... the , the ... and father laughlin , he said that it was god 's will ...

... we , we love her , dick and me ...

it 's not a good case . it 's a very good case .

it 's locked .

where is he ?

i had an appointment at his office , i think i must have got it wrong . we had a meeting ...

yeah .

i want to buy you a drink .

another , frank ... ?

what are you doing in new york ... ?

i need a cigarette ! she left my office four years ago , we 're looking for a chart ... i need a cigarette ...

hello . this is mr. dorchester in records . we 're looking for kathy costello ...

... four years ago ...

the hospital ... ?

the 'history ' ... ?

'you guys are a bunch of whores ... uh ... loyalty ... you do n't care who gets hurt ... you do n't have any loyalty ... '

you use their witness .

yeah .

d'you meet with dr. gruber ... ?

give 'em a box of macanudos .

today is tuesday . what ?

oh shit , what 's today ?

so what do you want me to do ? concannon 's going to try the case his way , i 'm going to try it mine . you want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he 's got some flack , got stories in the newspaper . i 'm going to win this case .

they still have to take it to a jury .

mary rooney . she wo n't talk to me . i tried her at the hospital . i 'm going to try her back at home . read this .

i 'm going to get laid .

jimmy ? bushmills . lookit , do me a favor . i 'll buy you a drink tomorrow .

right .

... gruber 's not bad .

who have we got ?

you -- listen : you said to me , 'if not now , when ... '

what ?

you need my help ... ? you need a goddamn keeper ... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand ? huh ... ? are you nuts ? eh ? are you nuts . what are you going to do , bring her back to life ?

... i 'm going to need your help ...

do n't touch anything .

what do you want ?

one lousy letter eighteen months ago ... i try to throw a fuckin ' case your way ...

hi , mickey ...

what ?

in new york ?

she did ?

yes .

... we were trying to restore her heartbeat .

we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes . we were trying to restore her ...

we , we were rather busy ...

yes .

yes .

okay . now , so he 's in jail . he , finally , he gets to see the light , he calls up harrington , he says he thinks he made a mistake . as if by magic , charges against him are dropped , he 's released from jail . p.s . he 's fired from the firm , his wife divorces him , he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years . you like that story ?

a huge law firm . okay ? they put him in the firm , he 's married , everything 's superb . franky , he 's starting to talk like he comes from dorsetshire , some fuckin ' place , 'you must drop by with pat and me ... ' okay ... ?

how 'm i doing so far ?

we 'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see ?

let 's go .

then our first target will be the initial landing place outside los angeles .

i probably would n't be able to get to them if i tried ...

that 's the kind of a kid brother you 'd have !

my kid brother has one . you know why ?

very futuristic . yours does n't really go with that butch haircut !

yes , with these suits . we 've used them before on atomic tests ... odd- looking , are n't they ?

i could n't see much in the dark - but it was one !

hours . i 've been so scared ... !

he liked you ... i could bawl my head off !

i liked him .

i have no close folks . my parents died when i was a kid .

southwest of corona , somewhere . there must have been another cylinder down here . they 've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out . there 's a farmhouse . let 's see if we can find something to eat ... !

is that ... machine ... ?

can you handle one of these ?

good to see you , general . this is pastor collins , director of civil defense . sheriff bogany , head of the local forces ... miss van buren .

i just told them the local situation . colonel heffner 's in full charge now .

did n't you have something to do with this ? i know you sent word to the sixth army command !

they 're really for long distance . when i want to look at something close ... i take them off .

i did n't know how to stop you ... !

what 's he like ?

how can you say that when you do n't know him !

aw , he is n't that good ... !

did it do you any good ?

you must have caught plenty with all that tackle !

did you see it come down ?

all right . i 'll get them ! go ahead - go ahead ! i 'll catch up with you .

gratzman ! -- gratzman ! did you get those biotics ?

if we get what transportation we can , and pick up instruments and books from pacific-tech ...

i believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood .

are they sure it 's a meteor ? it did n't come down like one .

it 's about that meteor . they say it 's a whopper . the district officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit . thought you might be interested ... it 's ten or twelve miles from here - over by linda rosa .

i just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted .

my orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there .

from the data - and from that picture the air force took earlier tonight ... ... what we 've got in the gully out there is a guide ship . one lands ... others follow later . they appear to clear an area , then drop in groups of threes , joined magnetically . is that possible ?

there 's a square dance at the social hall this evening .

it was nearer than that .

that probably dropped half way to pomona ! ... what do you think ?

number three to . d.o ... .number three to d.o .

how would i know ... !

i do n't know . a couple months . why ?

he 's not showing it until it 's down . but it sounds hot , and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is . you and robert got great ratings today . which is the first thing we needed to know .

can i read it ?

heather , i 'm stuck here . neither chuck or terry came in today . i ca n't get away !

chase . hi ...

guess so .

just be careful , okay ?

maybe you should tell me your dream .

anything other than the obvious bothering you ?

you get any sleep last night ?

i want my kid out of here now !

everything is not fine !

ms. langenkamp . i suggest you go home and get some rest . your son is fine . he 's been taken downstairs for further testing .

they are ... it happened in tonight 's quake . it happened just fifteen minutes ago . you must 've felt it .

is he all right ?

yes . it 's a story . a story for a movie .

you saw him , did n't you , dylan ! ?

that 's right . so i wo n't be long . meanwhile julie 's gon na be right here with you .

home , that 's right .

and ... what 's the man doing ?

in my bed .

mommy 's fine , dylan . just had a bad dream . what 're you doing out of bed ?

he can follow the breadcrumbs , right ?

they were safe and could sleep .

no . tonight . it 's important !

this is going to give you nightmares .

rex ? who 's rex ?

what ?

someone 's coming .

when do you think it 'll be done ?

anyway , what i was calling about was ... have you seen any of the script , by any chance ?

darker . more ... evil ?

it 's actually been giving me freddy nightmares .

you okay ?

you 're right . that sounds crazy !

you got it . what 's happening ?

john saxon . do you have any idea what time it is ?

you really think dylan 's okay ?

really ?

steady ...

i 've never mentioned it to him .

really ? hell , if having a screwy family made you crazy , the world 'd be one colossal nuthouse .

you 're not crazy , by the way .

no , you do n't , ma'am , it 's not necessary .

yes .

is chase porter your husband ?

thanks . just give them the time he called . they 're keeping a list , supposedly . sorry . my nerves are so raw these days .

big truck went right by before you opened the door . life on the fault line .

if freddy 's loose , i mean , in your script , where 's he going to go ? another age ? another form ?

you saying freddy 's this ancient thing ?

it can be captured , sometimes .

i think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress .

of course he is . freddy 's dead and gone .

do you let your child watch your movies ?

no , not really . i ...

can i get you something to drink ?

no time like the present . the car will bring you .

uh ... sure ... when ?

oh , hi . i 'm fine , sara . my god , a voice from the past !

claiming their place in the world .

because we believed we could make an impact out here . self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing .

we were idealists .

they 've become what you wanted . they 're a crew . that 's why he came .

i can take it .

do you remember the last time you and i danced under the stars ?

i 'd have liked to have said goodbye .

your father ?

that low passed through last night . may be a little bumpy out there .

she said `` none the better , you all go to hell ... ''

a pretty young maiden she happened my way ...

hey ! weigh ! blow the man down ...

everyone out of the rigging now !

skipper , uh , the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side .

yes , sir .

everyone aboard young bill ?

fifteen .

how old are you , son ?

my instinct was to not get electrocuted .

but your instinct was to lose sail ?

skipper called us out of the rigging .

why did n't you drop any sail ?

what do you mean ?

i could n't bring her down here until i knew you were safe .

yes sir .

gieg , chuck .

yeah .

figured what out ?

wan na bet ? takes me half a day to get through one chapter of lawford and i still do n't have any idea what the hell he 's talkin ' about . you know why it takes me so long to write papers ? because i ca n't spell . while everybody else is sleeping , i 'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary .

she is n't that old .

nobody says you have to be like me .

why then .

it 's no my fault i was born first . besides , nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation , so ease up on the sad sack stuff .

i got ta go .

i guess .

like you really care . like any of you give a shit what happens to me .

you only hurt yourself you know ?

yeah , but how are you supposed to make the first move ?

hey , shut up will ya ?

they do n't know that . we were the only one 's on deck . look , there 's nothing they can do to me right ? i 'm a kid .

look , i just better go .

no , i did n't .

honey , did you know that the albatross was captured by the germans during world war ii ?

what are you talking about .

jesus , you never told them ?

my brother . he fell out of the old beech tree . broke his neck . i was on a camp out . they started going at it , throwin ' things , a real knock down ... they did n't find him 'till the next morning . they did n't even know why he was up there .

where are you from any way ?

that 's like wondering if your mom and dad do it . who wants to know ?

i 'm used to spending a lot of time alone . i guess that 's what i thought it would be out here . but , it 's not is it ?

you should tell him . that 's something he can take with him .

they send us because they want us to change , or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same .

they have every right chuck .

i mean he has all these expectations and he does n't even know who his own kid is . what right did then have to show up here ?

well , spit it out .

i 'm here on behalf of the crew , sir .

what 's on your mind ?

should n't we turn away ?

it was my fault . i slipped .

yes , sir .

stow away ?

but you invited is aboard .

i thought we 'd have a better chance if i headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails .

and i would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here .

who is it philip ?

well , what does it have to do with ? us ?

what 's wrong , you do n't like steak ?

not a chance . remind them that according to the geneva convention , firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war .

a padlock .

we 're short one long boat too . come on .

you 're officer of the watch , george .

what ? ! what 's happening ? ! !

i need to know what i 'm working with ; what their boundaries are . their lives depend on it , and for that matter so does yours . we 've got to bring them together . make them a crew . we 're as strong as our weakest link and i do n't want to find that out the hard way . so , i will challenge them and they will come together .

jesus ! what the hell happened to him .

oh , praise the lord . relax everybody . everything is under control . the jug head 's going to think of something .

it matters to me .

i figured it out .

how would you know ?

i could n't do it .

what 's your problem ?

look , save it for somebody else will ya . this ancient shit does n't have anything to do with me .

if he 's a cuban , castro wears a dress .

outer .

son of a bitch ! !

there are some things that everybody does in the same language .

what are we supposed to talk about ?

no .

you 're a day late . we keep a schedule aboard ship . lives depend on it . hello , philip .

aaauuuhhh ! ! !

yes , that 's true .

... and that you invited him to strike you ? to fight it out on the deck of your ship ? !

he climbed when he was ready .

is it true that you forced robin weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic .

i do n't know that anything could have prevented what happened .

i am accountable .

the papers are going to eat you alive . even if you beat it , you 'll never get another commission . they want someone to be accountable .

the coast guard 'eagle ' . she never lost a race while you were skipper .

there are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the albatross . i have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking .

screw you , valentino . i have n't seen you swapping spit with anybody .

i 'm fine , thank you . i had a cardiac infarction but i 'm on a new diet and exercising regularly . i 've never felt better .

artie ? that you , artie ?

seein 's how you 're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss , do n't know how you can criticize .

sorry , gentlemen . i 'm 'most finished on my shoppin ' here .

fuck me .

say it ! ... i 'll tear your fuckin ' heart out , girl ... say `` fuck me '' soft - then i 'll leave . say `` fuck me '' ... whisper it ... then i 'll leave ... say it ... say it - say it - say it ...

no way ... get out ! ! !

no , he 's out changin ' the oil in the car .

what 's cao ben ?

forty bucks ...

come on outside , i got somethin ' to show ya .

she really say she was pregnant ?

be easy , sailor . there 's two employees . i take one in the back to open the safe , you keep the other ' n covered ... you ai n't plannin ' on raisin ' a fam'ly in big tuna , are ya ?

wouldn'ta guessed it , that 's sure .

thought you said this was a private club . how come i 'm allowed in without bein ' a member ?

restin ' in our room . she ai n't been feelin ' well .

that 's right ... could have a bad accident , though ... before ... durin ' ... or after a hold-up ...

no , of course .

that guy sailor came around this afternoon ... asked me if there was a contract out on 'im .

wish i 'd fuckin ' cut you up good .

you say it 's straight ahead a mile ?

that 's what i mean ... always looked like you was just knocked out in love ... was real nice to see .

not for lack of love , i can tell ya that .

hell , that rings a bell . someone told me somebody lookin ' like her was at the nothin ' fancy yesterday .

everythin 's relative . where 's that marietta pace fortune ? you two did n't split up , i hope .

hey ! ! ! ... johnnie farragut . how are you , my man .

i thought you two were in austin , texas . or takes-us , as they say in these parts .

no big buildings like in new orleans .

mr. san pedro sula is from honduras .

what happened on the charges ?

if you are truly wild at heart , you 'll fight for your dreams ... do n't turn away from love , sailor ... do n't turn away from love ... do n't turn away from love .

but i 'm wild at heart .

but i 'm a robber and a manslaughterer and i have n't had any parental guidance .

do n't fuck with me , man . you look like a clown in that stupid jacket .

are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl ? or are you gon na save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her ?

got ta admit , you guys are - two in four dozen .

why not ? how was the fishin ' ?

would you like to enjoy a martini with us ?

i could n't say , which one ?

he is my sponsor . the general is the head of the secret police of honduras .

you are from new orleans , senor farragut ?

see ya downstairs .

and to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight ...

i 'll pack my things and meet you downstairs .

this 'bout the fifth time ?

johnnie ... that 's the past ... we got ta get on to our future , sugar !

who ? ... uncle pooch ? ...

just some guys i met here ... i keep seein ' 'em ... now tell me ...

could she be doin ' okay , johnnie ? she 's tryin ' to prove somethin ' to me , that 's all . lula ai n't doin ' no more ' n showin ' off , defyin ' me ... johnnie , i 've done somethin ' bad ...

listen , johnnie , lula just called me . she knew you were in n.o. , so they left the city .

really , marietta , you got more scenarios swimmin ' around in your brain than carter got pills . try to take it easy . go over to myrtle beach for a few days .

i 'm scared , mama .

thinkin ' a second , baby .

and ?

heard grandpa santos and grandmama talkin ' .

why , pace roscoe ripley , ai n't you got one cute mouth tonight ?

do n't give me no trouble now , pace , please . this ai n't the easiest day in a long time . and what do you mean how are we gon na know what your daddy looks like ? you seen his photo .

what makes sense , is all .

he ai n't never known me , lula , so there ai n't much for him to forget . not seein ' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us , too .

i 'm sorry , sailor . i just ca n't help it . give me a minute and i 'll quit .

that smell 's still fillin ' this room good .

few beers is all . feelin ' any better ?

sailor ? you know what ?

no , i do n't think so , sail . i just need to lie down .

i 'm gon na stay here in this room , sailor . i do n't feel so good ? this heat makes me tired .

no radio or tv ...

not bad for eleven dollars a day .

she died right in front of me . why 'd she have to go and do that , sailor ?

i 'm afraid she is , baby .

sailor , what are we gon na do ?

there 's worse places , honey .

they have , sugar .

my mama ... so sailor , our histories have been somewhat intertwined .

yeah , i 'm here .

how 'd you know my daddy ?

we all got a secret side , baby . hope you do n't think i been lyin ' to you 'bout other things , sugar .

the world 's gettin ' worse , i think , sailor . and it do n't sound like there 's much we can do about it , neither .

not in houston . we 'd be better off in some place more out of the way .

you want to stick around here , sailor ? see if we can get some work ?

leave me be for a minute ? mama gets all insane and then i see you practicin ' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp . how you figure i 'm gon na feel ?

mama . i been thinkin ' about her . she 's prob'ly worried to death by now .

honey , we bein ' strangers here and all , this is the kinda place we do n't want to make nothin ' of nothin ' .

just part of life on the road , peanut .

sure you wan na do this ? might be a way they could track us .

i 'm goin ' .

where ?

i know , peanut . but it was n't all like you were so unhappy i was there , just you were upset . my bein ' there was upsettin ' to you . you had some kids there , little kids , and i guess you 'd got married and your husband was comin ' home any minute .

the water was rollin ' off me . and i was dirty , too , like i had n't had no bath in a long time , so the sweat was black almost .

no , i like gettin ' up around four a.m. and talkin ' bout wild animals ... though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream . i kinda wish i did n't remember it . up at pee dee , i could n't remember any of my dreams .

one person thinks he 's doin ' somethin ' good and ever'body else gets upset about it .

we sure do n't , honey ... get me a mounds ?

heard on the radio how doctors is usin ' leeches again , just in old times . you know , when even barbers used 'em ?

lula ... i learned somethin ' interestin ' today on a science show i heard on the radio ... how leeches is comin ' back into style .

there ai n't no water in the swimmin ' pool . just a dead tree fell in , prob'ly from bein ' struck by lightnin ' .

i h-a-t-e hotel bedspreads . they do n't hardly never get washed , and i do n't like the idea of lyin ' on other people 's dirt .

looks more like the ghost of the old south , but we 'll try her .

what it says on the bumper sticker up front . on that pickup .

life is a bitch and then you marry one .

okay , manslaughterer who 's broke his parole and got in mind nothin ' but immoral purposes far 's you 're concerned .

it ai n't . it 's part of the lessons of life . i picked me up a pack of vantages before we left the cape ?

you guess ? my parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt portagee county .

her face was half-pushed into the pillow , and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said , ' i wo n't suck you . do n't ask me to suck you . '

you mean like pedal pushers ?

she looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was irma .

sorry , baby ... when 's the first time you done it with a girl who was n't hookin ' ?

yeah , i had my first taste on that trip to juarez . at that age you still got a lot of energy .

i 'd got to the far end of the world for you , baby ... you know i would .

you up for that ?

maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much ...

let 's go dancin ' , peanut . i 'm ready .

sound like ol ' dell 's more ' n just a little confused , peanut ... too bad he could n't visit that ol ' wizard of oz and get some good advice .

it ai n't so funny now , though . december before christmas ? dell disappeared again and aunt rootie hired a private eye to find him . he was missin ' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin ' dressed in some filthy santa claus suit .

... are followin ' him around .

well , like mama told me , aunt rootie , dell 's mama ? she found cockroaches in dell 's underwear .

at pee dee , all you think about is the future , you know ? gettin ' out ? and what you 'll do and what you 'll think about when you 're on the outside again .

would n't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives ?

yeah ?

that do n't seem fair .

what 's that honey ?

what you have to get personal about so quick ? all i mean is you could possibly read a book .

just sounded like an old gal havin ' a good time to me ... you ready to dance ?

uncle pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin ' in myrtle beach . they still got way too much traffic there for my taste ... and another thing , baby ... that government of ours should be keepin ' us separated from outer space ...

well , sure . but he was super-gentle , you know ? i mean , he raped me and all , but i guess there 's all different kinds of rapes . i did n't exactly want him to do it but i suppose once it started , it did n't seem all that terrible . it was over pretty quick , and after uncle pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there . i stayed in bed till i heard him drive off . then i just went back into the kitchen and finished makin ' my sandwich .

no , he picked me up .

so how 'd he finally nail you ? right there in the kitchen ?

well , mama was at the busy bee havin ' her hair dyed ? and i was alone in the house .

camels , same as me ... guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness .

stab it and steer .

would n't make any difference .

figure we 'll go have supper someplace . maybe get some barbecue out by stateline . sailor always liked that havana brown 's pig pickin ' .

got any plans ?

six .

you ai n't takin ' pace , though .

i am all right , mama . that 's why i called , to let you know . i got ta go .

no , baby , do n't ! can i send you somethin ' ? you runnin ' low on money ? i 'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are .

mama , i 'm hangin ' up this phone now .

argentina ! lula , you 're outta your mind . now you just tell me where you are and i 'll come for you . i wo n't say nothin ' to the police about sailor , i promise . he can do what he wants , i do n't care .

no , mama , i 'm in mexico , and we 're about to get on an airplane to argentina !

are you comin ' back here soon , lula ? i need you here .

why , how could i not worry ? not knowin ' what 's happenin ' to you or where you are ? are you with that boy ?

you know who it was and you know you are n't , and i mean are not gon na see him ever ... end of story .

i 'm afraid his car is gone , mrs. fortune .

hey ... stop the nervous cry-baby routine ... you 're my girl now ... santos is gon na wipe away those tears and make you happy ... come on , let 's get outta here .

i 'm gon na take your silence as a `` yes '' ...

you give me your permission to kill johnnie farragut .

maybe i did ... try new orleans first ... lula ca n't ever stop talkin ' 'bout that town .

see ! i knew you had it all under control .

yes .

you want me to shoot sailor in the brains with a gun .

shoot him ? like with a gun ?

well , like kill him with the atomic bomb ?

like an accident where maybe lula might also get hurt ?

all right ... i want you ... to ... kill ... sailor ... as simple as that .

how would i do that ? send him on a trip - like maybe to hawaii ?

what 's with you ? you know what take care of him means . i do n't call santos except for one big reason .

i want you to take care of sailor , so he wo n't ever be able to bother my baby again .

oh yeah - sure ... okay .

no ... i just wanted to kiss you good- bye ... you know too much 'bout little lula 's mom ...

... sailor ripley ... can i talk to lula ?

heard you was goin ' out with that bitch 's daughter .

just passin ' through on my way to who knows where ...

oh ... look at this ... what do you want , snakeskin ?

that 's pretty simplistic , do n't you think ?

he 's right , you look horrible .

we 're springing you , leer . get some pants on .

me ? what can i do ?

that 's very enlightened , professor . it 's comforting to know that america 's children have you for a teacher .

oh , right . oola . about that jacket ...

i do n't think so . in my experience , signs are usually a lot more subtle .

in a sense .

such as .

only now i 'm starting to think the car was n't exactly jerry 's to give .

oh ! huh . exactly how do we do that ?

there is no problem . did i say there was a problem ?

so what 's the problem ?

shut up , james .

is he awake ?

ye-es ?

so sensitive .

so modest .

which is ?

i 've been doing this a long time , tripp . i feel this kid in my bones .

maybe ... i do n't know .

good idea , crabs . only one problem . i do n't know where they live .

james ? my james ? what 's happened ?

where would we go ?

shit .

tripp .

and now he 's addicted to painkillers .

not curtis .

well , i 'm going to read it anyway .

oh , i 'm sure you 'll find another . you always do .

this morning . i found a note in the kitchen .

trip ? ?

it was jerry nathan 's . he owed me money .

is n't she ?

you 're stoned .

she 's a transvestite .

i 'll be ... somewhere else .

it 's cool , jeff . really .

i mean , i was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- i was pretty bent in general .

jeff . sorry . i did n't even know this was your house until about an hour ago .

how are you -- is it joe ?

this 1966 maroon ford galaxie 500. you driving this car ?

you driving this car ?

i have to see her . as soon as possible .

no . there 's no one here .

so is my friend ... is sara still here ?

her dog , yes .

how long have you been smoking marijuana ?

you did .

and you 're saying it 's some kind of sign ? what the fuck 's the matter with you ?

who 's got a gun ?

move away , cupcake . he 's got a gun .

vernon .

yes . but that 's not why i called ...

you 're in kinship ?

i 'm in kinship . listen , sara , there 's some things we need to talk about ...

where are you , grady ? an elevator ?

do n't be . i do n't care if they expel me . i probably should be expelled .

that 's why she hates me . that 's why she makes me sleep in the basement .

get out of here .

six . their plane went down right outside scranton .

i 'm not going , with them .

i 'm not going with them .

where you going ?

okay .

when ?

i eat .

that 's why you 're having them . your spells .

arsonist 's daughter meant something .

shut up , james . you 're annoying . carrie and howard do n't know what the fuck they 're talking about , okay ? the entire class combined -- including the lovely hannah green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have , okay ?

i never said that .

yes you are . my stuff stinks . i know it . you said so yourself .

jealous ? of me ?

because you act like a goddamn spook all the time . not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you .

james , fall semester , first day of class , it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat .

what ?

oh . right . well , let 's try not to think about that .

want one . they 're incredible . incredible .

someone jumped on your car with their butt ...

kinship . and what 's here ?

i thought you were the guy who did n't like to lose control of his emotions .

amazing .

james leer , are you telling me your mother was a stripper ?

whatever kind they wanted her to be .

what kind of dancer ?

it 's a hellhole . three motels and a mannequin factory . my dad worked there for thirty-five years .

outside scranton .

jesus , james . wow .

humboldt county ?

do n't be proud , james . we 're in sewickley heights . we could find you a nice golf course to barf on .

i ca n't help myself . i do n't know what 's the matter with me .

is n't this ... ?

i got kicked out . well , not exactly kicked out . i was asked to leave .

well , james , you did shoot the head of the english department 's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia .

hm .

professor tripp ?

blocked .

afraid so .

i thought maybe you 'd won a radio contest or something . is that single- spaced ?

good , james . if the zodiac killer calls , be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right .

what 'd you tell him ?

i thought you might -- i do n't know -- swallow your tongue or something . i guess you really miss her , huh ?

i put you on the floor .

mmhmmm ... knap ... sap ...

miss sloviak 's .

that 's a big trunk . it fits a tuba , a suitcase , a dead dog , and a garment bag almost perfectly .

you ?

do you have a mirror ? it 's the best way to see if someone 's breathing .

no ! he was crazy . i did n't -- he looked -- i thought --

like the lady herself .

james . do n't leave just yet . there 's something i think you ought to see .

i saw a movie once . part of it took place in heaven . everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses . like that . at least that 's the way i remember it ...

actually , i saw the greenhouse . so i thought ... i thought i 'd come out here and take a look at it . you do n't see one of those every day . it looks like heaven ...

you cold , james ?

relax , james . i 'm not her father . i just rent her a room .

it was my mother 's . she won it in a penny arcade in baltimore when she was in catholic school .

no , it 's not that , it 's ...

i do n't know , grady . i just dropped him on a corner .

he shot the chancellor 's dog , did n't he ? the blind one .

oh . well . i ...

i do n't think it really matters , hannah . we could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point .

that strikes me as odd .

ail right . by the way , his friend ... ?

just checking .

me ? sure . why ?

some times ...

i guess you have to go on faith .

and you 're old .

i know .

terry told me about wonder boys . is it true ? did you lose it all ?

i 'm so glad to see you , sara .

and what do you think you might have said ?

it 's within the realm . he takes his souvenirs pretty seriously . and he was just a wee bit prickly this morning .

of course , i 'm sure . ah , christ , the puberty police are back .

someone stole my car .

it seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed .

about the baby .

i know that . i know what 's at stake here ...

are you limping ? why are you limping ?

i heard .

well , no , i do n't see any way . and i know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance .

no . there 's no way . i mean , do n't you think there 's no way ?

well ...

neither do i .

she 's left the room before . she always came back .

i 'm pregnant .

you go first .

well then . i 'd better show you . terry --

i do n't believe i know where the upstairs guest room is .

he said he has n't had a success in ten years and everyone in new york thinks he 's kind of a ...

he 'd call it habit . but now ... i get the feeling he 's going through the motions a bit .

forget it . i should 've known better . your friend is just , i do n't know , into collecting weird tricks . mind ?

sure it is .

disturbed . and when your friend crabtree gets done with him , he 's going to be even more disturbed .

sara . i 'm in love with her .

what is it , grady ?

yes ?

walter ?

hey , professor tripp .

is it good ?

oh . right . linda ... i have n't been doing a lot of sleeping lately . my editor 's in town and i have the book to finish and --

what made you pull out that old thing ?

just kidding .

we figure the perpetrator let him out . he 's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over .

horses , right . vernon something ... hardapple .

just a few then . the big ones .

mr. crabtree was saying how george sanders killed himself , only he could n't remember how .

i doubt it , darling .

i doubt i 'd recognize a '63 chateau latour if i was sitting on it .

i mean ... feelings .

carlos , i never raped a woman .

i 'm just talking , man .

you 're a good man , walter . okay , you did some wrong things , but inside you 're a good , decent man .

the important thing is that you and annette need to talk . she needs to see you , and you need to see her .

tell annette i 'm busy in july .

the birthday party .

what party ?

what 's happening ?

it was n't like that .

i should go . your sister worries , and when she worries she yells .

but maybe it 's not so healthy being so close , you know , to a school .

what ?

i was just thinking of ... the noise .

something wrong with that ?

beautiful . how 's business ?

no shit .

got a job at old frank 's place . his son runs it now .

do n't need to think fast to handle beer .

robin .

i have friends .

see anything interesting ?

i have to go .

not at first . you would stare at the tops of the trees so intently . any second i thought you would take off and fly .

not too far . are you a bird-watcher too ?

you live around here ?

sure .

birds .

then i 'd say you 're a lucky fellow .

it 's a free country , is n't it ?

the assault took place at approximately seven thirty .

i did n't say what time the assault occurred .

i 'll be asking the questions . last night , you hear anything unusual ? screams ? shouts ?

you knew her ?

that 's it . little red riding hood jumps out of the wolf 's guts with hardly a scratch . ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half ?

sure they do . but outside they 've got trees around them . the trees shade them from the sun . of course , the plants enrich the soil around the trees . one of nature 's symbiotic relationships .

what ?

like a piece of shit ? in my eyes , you are a piece of shit . think anyone would miss you if i threw you out the window right now ? i could say you jumped when i came in . who are they going to believe ? not you , because you 'd be a dead piece of shit .

but you are taking it ?

are you taking your medication ?

and your new apartment ?

i 'm adjusting okay .

well , mary , you 're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe . you do know what runs out of a sewer pipe , do n't you ?

ca n't i stay a little longer ?

you should go home .

i do n't mind .

do you still want me to sit on your lap ?

your daddy will always love you .

ms. kramer .

yes .

that 's okay ... does n't matter .

yes ?

walter .

can i ask how old you are ?

how do you feel about that ?

when the two of you held each other . when you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine . when your parents were out and the two of you were alone ... completely alone in that big house .

yes .

that 's all . i just liked smelling her hair .

what the hell are you doing there ?

just lying there . we 're taking a nap .

but roughly , how old ?

we 're little kids .

in my bed , rosen . where do you think ?

who do you see ?

i do n't see --

no . when i say the word `` pretty , '' when i say the word `` pleasure , '' what is the earliest memory you see ?

why ?

i do n't know .

if by `` problem '' you mean your desire for prepubescent girls , yes .

i ca n't move my patients around to accommodate one person .

is this the first one ?

i do n't know .

i want to be normal !

they usually tell me .

then how do you know if your patients are getting better ?

i do n't .

i suppose it 's however society defines it .

that is a marvelous image , walter . because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around .

then why are you talking about this ?

rosen ? i do n't have a problem with that .

is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch ?

honest ? your cheery personality makes my skin itch .

but you do n't like coming here . be honest , walter .

how 's the journal ?

try it .

it 's very good , indeed .

reflect .

i thought a journal would encourage you to reflect .

why not ?

walter , i 'd like you to try something for me .

not when they fly .

fucking liar .

i need a shower .

do you want to talk about it ?

prove it .

i 'm not scared .

what 's it look like ?

i think it 's a fucking good idea .

you 're scared .

us seeing each other .

maybe this is n't a good idea .

are you serious ?

you never asked them about it ?

no you do n't .

i love my brothers .

all three -- in chronological order .

well , most people are stupid . you want to talk about odds ? one day i 'll tell you how i survived as the youngest in a family of three sons . you wan na talk about odds ?

most people say the odds are against me .

being here , with me .

my father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave .

hey , i 'm not --

what ?

you should be shocked . or do you get off on this shit ?

the judge had a thing about sex offenders . later i heard his daughter had been raped . if i had n't had a good lawyer , it would have been twenty- five to thirty .

between ten and twelve . once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven . once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve . i always asked how old they were .

yeah .

when i do sleep , i sweat a lot . usually i get nightmares and wake up screaming .

what for ?

what ?

so ... what 's your dark secret ?

i thought you were just shy , but now i think it 's something else .

my place faces a truck street . i 've got cracks in every window from the shaking .

does n't it get noisy ?

sorry .

you should buy several . i 've got shitty light in my place , but my plants do n't seem to mind . light 's important , but it 's not everything .

i 'll buy a plant .

what ?

they 're all assholes .

neither do you .

most women would n't choose it .

what 's weird about that ?

people without cars .

want a ride ?

yeah , i 'm fucking fantastic .

well , you know lindsey , too damn aggressive -- son of a -- ! !

it was alright for a while , you know . but then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing , couple years ago .

okay , good reason . then what ?

piece of cake , baby .

this ai n't no drill , slick . make me proud .

okay so far .

no , bud , no ... not you .

'course is worked . you 're never wrong , are you ? how d'you feel .

lindsey , just put the thing on and shut up --

alright , put this on .

i do n't know how !

how ?

calm down , bud .

ca n't get to it . have to pull this panel off . you go any tools ?

you see where it 's coming in ?

good hundred yards , i 'd say .

wonderful . there 's some light from somewhere ...

well , that 's that .

you noticed .

you did okay , back there . i was fairly impressed .

he 's jammed the mechanism .

look , the guy 's operating on his own , cut off from chain of command . he 's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis . and he 's got a nuclear weapon . so , as a personal favor to me ... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while ?

lindsey ! wait a second --

god , you are the most stubborn woman i ever knew .

i saw something ! i 'm not going to go back there and say i did n't see it when i did . i 'm sorry .

look . i 'm just trying to hold this situation together . i ca n't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria --

bud , something really important is happening here .

if you say so . it could be anything .

come on , you guys ... look , this is the little one right here . you can see how it 's kind of zigging around .

what about o-2 ?

i do n't know . i do n't know !

whose then ? lindsey ? talk to me ...

fine . be that way .

no . look , forget it . i do n't want to talk about it .

i do n't know . divorce ai n't final . forgot to take it off .

you wan na know what i think ?

well , well . mrs. brigman .

virgil , you wiener ! you never could stand up to fight . you --

got it . over .

lins , stay away from that guy . i mean it .

come on , man . what else could it be ?

no , i mean it . those seals are n't telling us diddly . something 's going on .

check . then i just hang with these guys , right ?

hafta ... go on to ... the moonpool . only way .

not us . not human . get it ? something non- human , but intelligent ...

okay , here we go . start equalizing , y'all .

that thing was probably their version of big geek ... like an rov .

what good 's the money if your dick drops off in six months ?

i want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras . we need early warning if the soviet craft try another incursion .

wilhite , anything ?

neutron counter 's not showing very much .

get comfortable . the bad news is we got six hours in this can , blowing down . the worse news is it 's gon na take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later .

schoenick ... your lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move ...

well , yeah , but the tether off it ai n't gon na be fancy . when he gets down there he 'll just sit , like a dumb-shit . unless something wanders through view of the camera , you 'll get nada .

1840 ... 50 ... 60 ... 70 ...

what 's you depth , cab three ?

cab three , check . right behind you .

gotcha , cab three . who is that ? that you , lindsey ?

check this out .

he can still make it .

bud , according to monk here , you just set a record for the deepest suit dive . bet you did n't think you 'd be doing this when you got up this morning .

4800 feet . it 's official .

very good . about one person in twenty just ca n't handle it . they go buggo . they 're no way to predict who 's susceptible , so stay alert .

high-pressure nervous syndrome . muscle tremors , usually in the hands first . nausea , increased excitability , disorientation .

there you go ... must you always spoil everything !

i mean , to stay away longer -- two months ... a year ... three years ... yes , i know , it sounds absurd . and i feel awful . the very idea of losing you makes me want to die ... and yet ... i ... i just do n't have the same feeling for you any more .

no . it 's not enough ... i told you before that i would like to get away for a while and be alone .

but i think we should talk about it . or are you fully convinced that we too wo n't understand each other ?

i 'm certainly not going to swim across .

this one is gorgeous .

you know , i could just as well go without seeing him today .

i 'm thirsty .

up until now , dad , i 've been the one who has n't wanted to marry him .

you mean sandro , do n't you ? well , i beg of you , please , spare me that . goodbye , dad .

because it 's true . after thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone , i should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter .

to the fact of my retirement , not only as a diplomat but also as a father .

oh , very well . i 'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest . i should be used to it by now .

i understand very well . only i do n't want any rash assumptions to be made .

and you say that came from lisca bianca ?

somebody must live here !

then why do n't we go up and see the ruins ?

say , claudia , would n't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there ?

you 're that sleepy , eh ? what time do expect to get up tomorrow ?

why ?

are n't you going to change ?

i do n't doubt it . but at a time like this we 're the least suitable persons to be with him . and as far as telephoning him ... who knows where he is ?

yes , she started to but i did n't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say . if we had to listen to everybody ...

sandro , wait a moment , just one moment ... you seem like an entirely different person ...

yes . we 'll get married . you and i. what do you say ?

why are you looking at me like that ?

oh no ... it does n't please me at all ...

sandro ... maybe it 's best that you go in alone .

who knows why they all left ...

but why , claudia ? ... why ?

and what about you ?

no , i 'm sure it wo n't . move over there . let 's make believe nothing happened . and when we get to the next station , get off .

but sooner or later we 've got to end this relationship . and it 's better to do it right now .

but then when will we see each other ?

then i 'll go with you .

yes .

are you feeling better ?

no .

twelve years ... but why have n't they married ?

just several days ago , the thought of anna being dead would have made me sick . and now , i do n't even cry , i 'm afraid she might be alive . everything is becoming so damned simple and easy , even to deprive one 's self of pain and suffering .

i 'm afraid that anna has come back . i feel she 's back , and that they 're together .

patrizia ... patrizia ... where 's ettore ?

how do you manage to put up with all this confusion ? you always said people bore you .

i 'm not coming .

do you consider that a compliment ?

you say that just to flatter me .

but are n't you tired ? i can just about manage to stand on my feet ! raimondo !

i 'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands .

what amazes me , is sandro . he seems so calm .

one would have to be in love with somebody to know that .

now what do i have to do to be left in peace ?

it could n't be any clearer .

but why all nudes ?

but how can you carry on a discussion in this heat ?

if it rains , i 'll buy myself an umbrella .

but why ? ... what if it starts to rain ?

who 's moving ?

i detest comparisons made with oil .

i know we are . but as the years go by , we become even worse . is n't that so , corrado ?

giulia , do n't you understand that the more involved you become with people , the more difficult it is to speak with them ?

but why me ? ... ask claudia , she 's much more beautiful than me .

answer me , why do n't you try posing ? i 'll paint you a beautiful portrait .

it 's strange how anxious women are to display themselves . it 's almost a natural inclination .

i thought the model was something obsolete nowadays . did n't you , claudia ?

and where do you find the models ?

anybody can hold a brush in his hand . all you need is to buy some oils and start painting . even rembrandt did the same .

they tell me you have a lot of trouble at home . is that right ?

music , of course . to get a sweetheart , one has to look around , but to get a radio , all you have to do is buy one .

we have a radio like this , too .

yes , she takes care of the garden .

i work there but i 'm really a stranger .

what boat ?

but where did you come from ?

yes , even i had a mother . she was part austrian , but she was still my mother . my childhood was like a tennis match ; they bounced me back and forth , here and there ...

yes , we will .

and here 's sandro . why do n't you two go upstairs and change ?

we 've decided to go to montaldo 's place . in fact , ettore should already be there .

what do you want us to do ? i do n't know myself ... but we 'll do something .

anna is an excellent swimmer . even with a cramp , she would have managed to reach shore somehow .

claudia is n't coming with us . will you please take care of her luggage ? thanks .

here i am , patrizia . i 'm always here .

i know , dammit , i know ! and just think -- if there ever was a woman so right , so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations , degradations , infidelities ... of.. . of ... of debaucheries , it 's her . well , anyway , she 's faithful . faithful out of laziness ... of unwillingness .

if women 's breasts were colored , yours would be blue ...

why have we stopped ?

then let 's call it a business proposition . something to round out your salary .

who knows ? ... another one has it that she entered a store in troina . this information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought i do n't know what in his store ... at troina .

no , i 'm not . why do you think she does all this ? it 's one of the many ways she can put herself on display . when you bait the trap , the mouse will snap . to tell you the truth , if it was n't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month 's salary , well ... but you had something you wanted to ask me ?

she costs a hundred thousand lire .

should you see a doctor ?

yes , mother .

why ?

my dear , i do n't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything .

nonsense , i 'm your mother now and i want you to eat .

god blew up the hindenburg . he 'll blow me up , that 's what she said ...

oh my dear child .

no ... i mean ... i mean look at these . i 've got to lose weight , i 'm a blimp .

agnes ...

look at the statues , they 're thin .

it 's a sin to be fat .

who told you this ?

no he does n't . he hates fat people .

i do , i have to be attractive to god .

... you need n't worry about being attractive here .

i am , there 's too much flesh on me .

no .

mother miriam was with you was n't she ?

i hate him .

who ?

i hate him for what he did to me .

i hate him ...

stay away from me ...

it 's bleeding ... i 'm bleeding ... my god it wo n't stop , i ca n't get it to stop . let go of me , i wish you were dead .

yes .

are you frightened ?

yes .

from the belltower the day she before she died .

yes .

she said michael .

yes .

frightened .

alright agnes ... it 's alright . one , two three ... it 's alright ... it 's me , doctor livingston , it 's alright , alright . thankyou agnes , thankyou . how do you feel ?

of me . oh ... god ! my god ... water ... it 's all water ...

which one ?

what do you think it 's there for ?

no .

a wastepaper basket .

above the bed ? any ... anything else ? what do you you see , something different ? what is it ?

sister marguerite i think .

will she be angry ?

why were you afraid ?

because i was afraid .

why ?

i had a baby .

i 'm frightened .

what kind of trouble ? what kind of trouble agnes ?

good . would you like to tell me why you 're here ?

who am i ?

oh agnes , oh agnes , it 's alright , it 's alright , it 's alright , it 's alright , i love you .

are you intelligent ?

no i 'm not .

and that you 're stupid ?

she tells you you 're ugly ?

yes ?

... makes me ...

you can tell me .

i breathed !

i was a mistake .

... that you do n't remember getting pregnant ...

is that what she said ?

agnes , how did your mother get you ?

how would that person get one if they did n't want one ?

well i do n't think i 'm old enough and besides i do n't want to have a baby .

i could never be a mother .

yes .

do you ?

you have trouble sleeping ?

oh , no place as wonderful as this . agnes ... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else ?

numbers ... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end .

like what ?

oh , they frighten me , i 'm afraid i 'll drop them . they have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid . i was dropped on my head , that 's why i do n't understand things .

well i think they come from ... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear . that makes good babies start to grow . and bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there , and they start to grow , grow , till they come out down there . i do n't know where good babies come out . and you ca n't tell the difference ... except bad babies cry a lot ... and they make their fathers go away ... and their mothers get very ill ... die sometimes .

one .

does it bother you ?

anything ?

yes i do , but i want you to ...

from god .

where did the baby come from ?

in the middle of all the pain ?

i went to my room .

why should they ?

would you like to talk about it ?

you 've been alone together ?

do you think he loves you ?

yes .

i do n't know .

was it sister marguerite ?

sister ...

? ? ?

martha , you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law .

if i find anything i 'll call you .

larry ...

you got to be crazy .

no !

i 'll have a decision by next week .

yes , that 's because i 'm getting to her .

? ? ?

what about roger ? he 's free .

did you have a good week mama . are they treating you all right ?

shut up , i 'm trying to watch this .

uh huh .

oh that one there , in the corner .

well that 's a lot of land . you must have help . do you have field hands that help you ?

oh , we own the land around here . but we rent it out . we keep a few acres for ourselves , some wheat , corn , some vegetables .

what does this have to do with.. ?

why do you call it an investigation ? i never have .

you tied the cord around its neck .

no !

oh , do n't be ridiculous .

did you know she was pregnant ?

my god , but you 're determined .

somebody told her .

then why are you so obsessed with her ? you 're losing sleep over her ? you 're thinking about her all the time . you 're bent on saving her . why ?

but she is not an enigma mother . everything that agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry . one , two , three , right down the line .

she is an innocent .

but how did it happen ?

well give me a reasonable explanation

do n't be ridiculous .

for the church ?

you 're what ?

no .

begin what ?

do you think agnes is still attached to god ?

yes i do .

long , thin and filtered .

fine thanks ...

i 'd love one .

so you left the church because you had freckles ?

nothing ...

she 's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone .

an unhappy woman ...

i do n't give a damn about her spiritual health .

her spiritual health .

and my permission ?

there is more here than meets the eye is n't there ? lots of dirty little secrets .

oh , dear god .

do you know what she did to her ?

listening to angels ?

yes .

like keeping her home from school ?

no , it just makes you doubly responsible does n't it ?

what sheets ?

there 's nothing here .

take at look at it .

do you remember anything unusual happening at the time ?

aquittal .

what ?

i am ...

? ? ?

god 's victim . that 's her innocence . she belongs to god .

it was healed by the following morning and she started eating again ...

this was before her pregnancy ?

this convent is locked solid . the only one that has a key is sister marguerite and she would n't let christ in after dark .

that 's absurd !

i 've already told you what i thought .

that 's ridiculous ...

well ... what do you think ? is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre ... or maybe she 's perfectly sane and just a very good liar .

yes , but that was some ten months ago . i fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial .

believe me , i 've done everything possible short of asking agnes .

and you did n't try to find out who ?

could there have been anyone else ?

unfiltered .

the cards ... you 're bank .

eh ?

i 'm a deserter , too .

oh , it 's all right .

i 'm a deserter .

all right , take your hoop and bowl .

bet you 're only eight and a half .

here , mate , that 's my hoop , stop playing with it .

the police station .

yeah .

oh now , they ca n't do that to me . it 's all your fault . oh yes it is and if they do n't turn up i would n't be in your shoes for all the ...

they 'll be here .

and hurry , they 're not looking too happy .

please do , i 'll not need them for fifteen minutes . thank you .

spoil sport !

i 've made the scene .

no . i do n't .

eh , ringo , do you know what happened to me ?

you do - repeatedly .

no , she 'll only reject me in the end and i 'll be frustrated .

you 've got an inferiority complex , you have .

get him out of here ! !

oh , you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong ?

and who 's this susan when she 's at home ?

and that pose is out too , sunny jim . the new thing is to care passionately , and be right wing . anyway , you wo n't meet susan if you do n't cooperate .

i do n't care .

grotty ?

i would n't be seen dead in them . they 're dead grotty .

i 'll have a bash .

well , not your real opinion , naturally . it 'll be written out and you 'll learn it . can he read ?

yes . your grandfather 's stirred him up .

you see , he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher .

oh , that 's me other grandfather , but this one 's me grandfather and all .

but your grandfather lives in your house . i 've seen him .

yes , you 're quite a feather in the cap . hello , i 've got one ... oh , i think so ... yes , he can talk ... well ... i think you ought to see him . of course , right away .

is he ?

oh , i 'm sorry , i must have made a mistake .

i do n't think that bit 's right .

follow your impulse .

hello , he 's not talking to me . he 's having a sulk .

the old fella wanted these pictures and norm said he could n't have 'em , all i said was 'aw go on , be big about it . '

well , what happened ?

of course .

pity .

and you honestly think that 's what she meant ?

is she ?

why selfish ?

is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself ?

i bet you do n't sound like real people .

but that 's not like a real person at all .

the big hammer ?

no . i 'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene . i just felt like doing those lines .

thank you .

you 're from liverpool , are n't you ?

i 've got you worried , have n't i ?

what are they saying ?

and if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket .

shush ! have they roughed you up yet ?

ringo , me old scout , they grabbed yer leg for the iron too , did they ?

i 'm not wrong .

you 're only right .

yeah ... that 's right .

and that lot 's never happier than when they 're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat , i 'd like to know .

oh ... i dunno .

what 's that mean ?

so you < u > are < /u > a man after all .

eh ... you 're a bit old for that sort of chat , are n't you ?

that 's it , parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living !

parading 's better !

any old where ... but not our little richard ... oh no ! when you 're not thumping them pagan skins , you 're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish !

is there a fire , then ?

well , you got me here so do your worst but i 'll take one of you with me . oh , i know your game , get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but i 'll defy you still .

you see . you know your trouble -- you should have gone west to america . you 'd have wound up a senior citizen of boston . as it is you took the wrong turning and what happened , you 're a lonely old man from liverpool .

before you go , i think it 's only fair to warn you about me grandson ... do n't let our paul have his own way all the time , 'cos if you do he wo n't respect you !

here , pauly .

we 've just finished , pauly . hey george , write us your john henry on this picture .

well , it may be a joke , but it 's his nose . he ca n't help having a horrible great nose , it 's the only one he 's got . and his poor little head 's trembling under the weight of it .

and i take a left-handed view of life , i 've got to .

why do you always use your left hand ?

a harmless bit of fun , aah , none of you have any sense of humour left these days .

and to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars !

you 're undressed . where are your clothes ?

clean though , is n't he ?

no , that 's his other one .

well , i got a few things to say to you , two-faced john mccartney .

well , i 've got me gob stopper . look , a genuine stradivarius , hand tooled at dagenham .

do n't be callous .

i hope he fell off .

shurrup ! look , mister , we 've paid for our seats too , you know .

oh , i see .

how d'you reckon that one out ?

eh ... pardon me for asking but who 's that little old man ?

you 're a swine . so hurry up ... we 're travelling !

what ?

the office was on the phone , they think it 'd be better if we pushed straight to wolverhampton .

hi , our lot !

hi norm !

sit down , the lot of you .

come on speedy !

come on , shake , we 'll leave 'em to their penmanship .

no .

eh , have you got paul 's grandfather ?

he started it .

are you listening to me , lennon ?

i knew i could rely on you .

mind you , i stood up for you , i mean i would n't have it .

it 's all over the place , everyone knows .

that 's what you tell me .

no , i 'm not .

since you ask , yes . aah , come on , ring , we love you .

it 'll only get you into trouble .

well , that 's just your opinion . do i snore , paul ?

you 've lost him .

i knew it , < u > he < /u > started it , i should have known .

but ...

when i tell you to stay put , stay put .

none for me , then ?

clever . george .

what ?

oh they 've probably gone to the canteen , cup of tea , like .

it 's not my fault .

you were twanging too loud .

and they want me ?

oh , anything you say , paul .

he ca n't be far .

put it this way , he 's mislaid him .

what is he ?

not sitting on our butts in here , that 's for sure .

locked .

i feel like shit ...

i think that 's a pretty reasonable request .

god i 'm hungry .

i was scanning the horizon to see what i could pick up . look there , on that screen .

take a look .

what is it ?

just machinery .

no , you 'll follow me .

martin , would you run me an atmospheric ?

close enough to walk to !

yeah . two hours .

any rotation ?

i got it . oh boy .

sandy , scan the whole sky .

a transmission ?

the reaction has proceeded too far . the core has begun to melt . engines will overload in 2 minutes , 35 seconds .

hold it , i ca n't hear a damn thing !

i have a temporary sequence on the monitor --

i am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise .

it 's still in the ship ?

all over the ship ; we 'll have to check the charts to know for sure .

bulbs burned out , nobody bothered to replace 'em .

machine 's screwed up , i ca n't tell . needle 's spinning all over the dial .

i did n't say it was bad for you , it 's just kind of sickening , that 's all .

yes , i know what they make it out of , so what ? it 's food now . < u > you 're < /u > eating it .

it could n't translate the whole thing , only three phrases . i 'll just read it to you the way i got it : `` ... hostile ... survival ... advise do not land ... `` and that 's all it could translate .

why , what 's wrong ?

jay , we 've got a problem . i was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability .

yeah , okay . go ahead .

what ?

has the hull been breached ?

-- and the cooling unit on the other .

do n't know -- broussard got hurt somehow .

right .

there 's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge . i 'll go get it .

it looks completely different from the first one -- it 's more like a worm with legs ... and tentacles .

all right -- roby and melkonis will go with faust . hunter and i will make up the second team .

i hope not .

might even incinerate the damn thing .

what ?

right .

and when will you be ready to do that ?

martin , this is jay . the intakes are clogged with dust . we overheated and burned out a whole cell .

we ca n't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose .

it 's eating a hole in the floor !

yeah , but how ? his nose and mouth are blocked .

blood 's thoroughly oxygenated .

he would n't open the lock ; he was going to leave us out there .

it must have stopped moving . i 'm not getting anything .

well ... now we have to herd that thing up here .

the ship 's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back .

we can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely , once the lifeboat is in space .

oh no ! we ca n't fight this thing ! there 's only six hours of air left -- we 're dead men !

well , what the hell good can we do in here ? we ca n't grab it -- it might jump on us --

no , do n't open the door . we do n't want it escaping .

maybe it was n't always dead .

how could anything be indigenous to this asteroid ? it 's dead .

you know , it 's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form , and now we run into a veritable zoo .

i 'll come with you .

careful , do n't get under it !

ask him .

well , how does it feel to be rich men ?

is it armed ?

i should hope so ! and we 'd better make sure it 's pretty far from the ship when we blow it .

this should do it .

we can use the flamethrower .

blow the ship up ?

i think it 's fizzled out .

oh ... god ...

i guess i had it coming . let 's call it settled .

oh no .

just can that crap ! i 'm in command here till chaz returns ! and nobody 's leaving this ship !

no .

what ? what was that ?

i 'm trying .

and what do we do when we find it ?

reminded me of when i was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans .

how the hell should i know ? come on , give me a hand , let 's get him out of there !

can you see anything ?

air lock ?

how far ?

that way .

just settle down . sandy , you get any response yet ?

well , we ca n't go anywhere in this darkness . how long till dawn ?

feast your eyes .

sandy , you want to give us some vision ?

tastes like something you 'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs .

we do know that .

these day and night cycles are totally disorienting . i feel like we 've been here for days , but it 's only been how long ?

source of transmission is to the northeast ... about 300 meters .

what did it do to you ?

kablooey .

and you 'll let me know when you 've got it coming this way ...

yes , and maybe launch the boat and blow it too ... if the others are injured .

now . if we can get it into the boat , we wo n't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space .

so what do we do ? do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now ?

no , it wo n't work and i just realized why . there 's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat . only one of us could survive .

does n't matter -- we 're already at light speed . and when we get back to the colonies , they 'll pick us up in the network .

right ... but it 'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core . in the meantime , we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship .

that 'll blow the ship up .

it was time for that a couple days ago .

poor kitty ; puss puss puss .

then that tomb ... must have been some kind of fertility temple ... where they stored their eggs , and maybe held mating rituals ...

by eating our food supplies .

this stuff 's deadly -- i hope we know what we 're doing .

you win .

all right , so that 's what we 've got . a week . it 's plenty of time .

that 's okay , he can remain in hypersleep until they 're ready to treat him .

where did the parasites come from ?

we 're coming up now , open the outer lock door .

thank christ ! we lost you ! listen , there 's been a new development --

i do n't even know what i 'm looking for .

but ?

i agree . this is the single most important discovery in history .

martin , uh , we 've found it .

good . i 'm getting you clear too . let 's just keep the line open .

sandy ... how far are we from the source of the transmission ?

well , it 's finally happened .

oh my god .

chaz , i 've got something here on my security alert . a high priority from the computer ...

it 's nothing , doc . just a ... touch of indigestion ... something .

forget that . i want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours . i 've got some toxin build-up tests still to run .

looks like a spore . fungus of some kind , maybe ?

do you wan na head back and call it in ?

i found it ...

comin ' up the central reservoir .

are you alright ?

too many .

we figured on it being a magnetic anomaly , but we ran a back-trace just to make sure .

that 's the second time i ran it , and it still reads the same .

no , but i got something that might interest you .

how much air-time have i got ?

oh , man ...

do it .

match it !

can we move it to a different orbit in time ?

we ran a trajectory simulation . if they carry on along that path , it 's possible they 'll make intra-orbital insertion .

couple more seconds !

it 's alright , it 's cool ...

what ? where ?

i 'll come with you .

forget it , man .

hey , guttierez ?

yeah ?

one more sweep ... one more sweep . i 'm getting tired of one more fuckin ' sweep . we 're been lookin ' for this thing for three days now , and found zip .

c'mon , man . one more sweep .

one final point . killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself . however , just to add a little incentive ... i 'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does .

shit ! our armory 's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores . we got about two clips left for an autoloader , and that 's it .

give me twenty minutes and i 'll do it myself .

what 's the problem ?

okay , i 'm out of here !

there 's still time to back-out .

how many ... how many people are missing ?

it left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here ...

punch me in a solution for their delta-vee .

they 've changed their heading again .

get off an all-bands emergency distress , and put it on a repeater .

ackland ? i do n't know him well enough to say . if we were back on earth we could run him though an aldhoven test and find out for sure . there 's not much we can do out here .

do you believe him ?

do you think ackland 'll sit tight ?

want some ?

real man ' drink .

what is that ?

hey , boss . wondered where you 'd gotten to .

nah , i 'll stick it out for another hour or so .

jesus .

why not ? tell me , phoebe , do you want some day to have an award like that of your own ?

phoebe ?

it 's a very famous name , mr. dewitt .

we wo n't disturb her rest . it seems she left her award in the taxicab . will you give it to her ?

hello , there . who are you ?

exactly . here . take it to the party instead of me .

because i do n't want to .

i do n't think i 'm going .

then say so .

no-no-no ...

i had to get in , to meet margo ! i had to say something , be somebody , make her like me !

a matter of opinion . granted . it is also true that you worked in a brewery . but life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it . as a matter of fact , it got less and less dull - until you boss 's wife had your boss followed by detectives !

everything . because after tonight , you will belong to me .

what have you got to do with it ?

champion to champion .

- it 's important right now that we talk . killer to killer .

well , say something - anything ! congratulations , skol - good work , eve !

we sat and talked , addison . i want a run of the play contract .

the setting was n't romantic , but lloyd was . he woke me up at three in the morning , banging on my door - he could n't sleep , he told me - he 's left karen , he could n't go on with the play or anything else until i promised to marry him ... we sat and talked until it was light . he never went home ...

i see . and when was this unholy alliance joined ?

lloyd richards is commercially the most successful playwright in america-

she 's always been so fantastically devoted to lloyd . i would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-

some plain soda . lloyd must be expecting a record run in new haven ...

also with the reluctant compliments of max fabian .

suites are for expense accounts . are n't you being extravagant ?

you know me better than that .

stop rehearsing your column ... is n't it strange , addison ? i thought i 'd be panic-stricken , want to run away or something . instead , i ca n't wait for tonight to come . to come and go ...

just like it .

oddly enough - she did n't say a word about margo . just that she 'll be happy to do what she can to see that i play the part .

i 'm not surprised . after all that humble pie ...

just some coffee .

a fine old theater , the shubert . full of tradition , untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire ... by the way , what was your husband 's name ?

that 's right .

let 's have a minimum of pretending . i 'll want to do a column about you-

even if i wanted to - as you say - be less humble , blow my own horn ... how would i do it ? i 'm less than nobody .

we all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns . if we do n't blow them - who will ?

please do .

you 're more than kind . but it 's still miss channing 's performance . i 'm just a carbon copy you read when you ca n't find the original ...

i consider myself lucky they did n't throw things .

tell me this . do they have auditions for television ?

that 's how you met me . in passing .

that is n't a waiter , my dear . that 's a butler .

as soon as the peasants stop pawing her .

in my case it 's necessary . too many taxi drivers write plays .

we all have abnormality in common . we are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity , we theater folk . we are the original displaced personalities ...

what makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair ?

it 's new margo . but she 's just as late as the old one .

you were there ? at the play - last night ?

to the best of my recollection , neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation .

how nice for lloyd . and how nice for eve . how nice for everybody .

bill did n't say - but lloyd was beside himself . he listened to his play as if someone else had written it , he said , it sounded so fresh , so new , so full of meaning ...

in time she 'll be what you are .

how nice .

it was n't reading , it was a performance . brilliant , vivid , something made of music and fire ...

margo , as you know , i have lived in the theater as a trappist monk lives in his faith . i have no other world , no other life - and once in a great while i experience that moment of revelation for which all true believers wait and pray . you were one . jeanne eagels another ... paula wessely ... hayes - there are others , three or four . eve harrington will be among them ...

just slipped your mind .

naturally enough , your understudy .

over ? it ca n't be . i 've come to read with her . i promised max .

i do not . how do you do ?

bill ...

there goes eve . eve evil , little miss evil . but the evil that men do - how does it go , groom ? something about the good they leave behind - i played it once in rep in wilkes barre ...

i understand she is now the understudy in there .

i would n't want you to marry me just to prove something .

the terms are too high . unconditional surrender .

well , i am .

that word again ! i do n't even know what it means ...

you 're being terribly tolerant , are n't you ?

do n't calm down .

i 'm nothing but a body with a voice . no mind .

the kid . junior .

so full of meaning , fire and music !

what 's all over ?

if my guests do not like it here , i suggest they accompany you to the nursery where i 'm sure you will all feel more at home .

would n't you feel more natural taking a bow ?

many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body . where has it been laid out ?

she has n't cut them yet , and you know it ! so when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom , benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - i wo n't have it ! eve harrington has never by word , look , thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love ! and to intimate anything else does n't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of !

- guilty .

for instance - you !

so she seems .

that never stopped you before .

i had no idea you were even here .

when i 'm guest of honor ?

i thought you were going to be late-

you 've heard it . about when i looked through the wrong end of a camera finder .

happy little housewife ...

many happy returns of the day ...

the reading could have been better , but you said it - now `` many happy returns of the day ... ''

happy birthday , darling ...

kid stuff or not , it does n't happen every day , i want to heat it - and if you wo n't say it , you can sing it ...

when - when are you coming back ?

bill ? have i gone crazy , bill ?

am i going to lose you , bill ? am i ?

i 'll try .

the lack of pretense , that sort of strange directness and understanding-

she 's quite a girl , that what's-her name ...

byron could n't have said it more graciously ... here we go-

where 's my coat ?

your make-up 's a little heavy .

then face it . i have . since that first night - here - in the dressing room .

i 'm for it .

everything .

so am i .

you should n't have had any doubts .

i 'll admit i was worried when max called . i had my doubts .

ah ...

it 's only one picture deal .

is it the money ?

i just wondered .

why ?

hello , what 's your name ?

no thanks , birdie .

i ai n't dense . and he 's been here twenty minutes .

do n't be dense . the party .

i 'll tell you how . like - let 's see - like she was studyin ' you , like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints . how you walk , talk , think , eat , sleep-

she thinks only for me ... ... does n't she ?

night an ' day .

now you want an argument .

but the wardrobe women have got one . and next to a tenor , a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-

something maybe grew a size bigger .

oh , brother .

oh , brother .

you rest . i 'll get it ...

it was for my report .

please do n't have me arrested , please ! i did n't steal anything - you can search me !

who are you ?

thank you , karen .

a part in a play . you 'd do all that - just for a part in a play .

after all you 've said ... do n't you know the part was written for margo ?

yes , you will . you theater people always do . nothing is forever in the theater . love or hate , success or failure - whatever it is , it 's here , it flares up and burns hot - and then it 's gone .

he 's not my friend . you were my friends ...

- and you felt just like that talking to addison .

nothing definite yet - it 's just to have lunch .

eve . i 'm fond of margo too . but i know margo . and every now and then there is nothing i want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants .

you must n't mind margo too much , even if i do ...

i seem to be forever thanking you for something , do n't i ?

the show must go on .

do n't worry too much about that . margo just does n't miss performances . if she can walk , crawl or roll - she plays .

karen ... ... is n't it awful , i 'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you 've already done .

karen .

i 'll be at the old stand , tomorrow matinee-

it could n't possibly interest you .

eve . eve harrington .

oh , no ...

not at all .

i was dreadful , miss channing , believe me - i have no right to be anyone 's understudy , much less yours ...

every performance ? then - am i safe in assuming you like it ?

no , thank you . yes . i 've seen every performance .

hello , miss harrington .

well , if you 'd been here to begin with , i would n't have dared to read at all ...

terribly sorry i 'm late , lunch was long and i could n't find a cab - where 's miss caswell , shall we start ? oh , hello , eve ...

i 'm sorry , i did n't mean to-

it seems i ca n't think of a thing you have n't thought of ...

right here .

quite sure . i find it just a bit too - too `` seventeenish '' for me ...

very becoming . it looks better on you than it did on me .

during your second act scene with your father , roger ferraday 's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch . he 's been coming closer down every night ...

please , do n't misunderstand me , mr. richards . i think that part of miss channing 's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays ... your new play is for miss channing , is n't it , mr. richards ?

check .

but not right away ? first the business of fighting them off , chin up , stout fella ...

it get better ! `` - about the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched first ladies of the stage to encourage , shall we say - younger - actresses ; about miss harrington 's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity- ''

`` ... my hat which has , lo , these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears , is lifted to miss harrington . i am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops . '' ... i thought that one went out with woollcott ... down here ... here , listen to this- `` ... miss harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our theater of permitting , shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory- ''

silly , is n't it ? you 'd think they 'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm ...

i do n't suppose the heater runs when the motor does n't ?

is n't that what they always say ?

margo . bill is all of eight years younger than you .

more than anything in this world , i love bill . and i want bill . i want him to want me . but me . not margo channing . and if i ca n't tell they apart - how can he ?

what about bill ?

come to think of it , i have n't been very pleasant for weeks . for that , i 'm truly sorry . more than any two people i know , i do n't want you and lloyd to be angry with me ...

it does n't matter .

be brave . he 'll come back - with or without gas .

of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-

margo , nothing you 've ever done has made me as happy as your taking eve in ...

they 're nobody 's fans ! they 're juvenile delinquents , mental detectives , they 're nobody 's audience , they never see a play or a movie , even - they 're never indoors long enough !

they 're your fans , your audience-

hi . hello , darling-

i did n't think you would ! it seems to me , karen , that for some tine , now , you 've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-

i have no possible interest in anything she 'd have to say .

after all , maybe she just wants to apologize ...

what are you going to wear ?

well of all-

darling , i did n't promise eve anything . just said i thought she 'd be fine for the part , but there were some practical difficulties ...

i 'm glad bill 's back .

margo - and bill - want us to meet them at the cub room tonight , after theater . for a bottle of wine .

that bitter cynicism of yours is something you 've acquired since you left radcliffe !

no , i got the idea myself - while she was talking to me ...

eve would ask abbott to give her costello .

maybe get some younger actress for the part ? someone who 'd look the part as well as play it ?

what with taxes coming up - and since i 'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well , i 've been thinking ...

that 's quite a change of subject .

she wanted to explain about her interview , wanted to apologize to someone - and did n't dare face margo ...

lloyd , be careful ...

five-fifty-five . we 'll be at the station in plenty of time ...

i just do n't want margo to miss her train . as it is , she 'll barely make the theater ...

it 's going to be a cozy weekend .

margo has n't done badly by it .

- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about ... until his play becomes a vehicle for miss channing ...

up to here ! that 's where i 've got it - up to here ! of all the star ridden , presumptuous , hysterical-

in a minute ...

now let 's not get into a big hassle-

the critics thought so , the audiences certainly think so - packed houses , tickets for months in advance - i ca n't see that either of lloyd 's last two plays have hurt you any !

how was the concert ?

well . i do n't want to play `` cora . ''

very discreet . a note right out in the open like that . next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass ...

too bad .

the audience will want its money refunded , believe me .

how fortunate that i have an understudy so ready , so willing and so able to go on .

i have no intention of having an accident !

karen and i just do n't want an accident-

it 's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto !

then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind ? sherwood ? arthur miller ? beaumont and fletcher ?

you have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most !

i 'm sure you underestimate yourself , eve . you always do . you were about to tell me about eve ...

eve ? eve , my understudy ? but i had no idea ...

she 's your understudy .

just one person . is n't that so ? you know what this is all about , do n't you ? it has very little to do with whether you should play `` cora '' - it has everything to do with the fact that you 've had another fight with bill .

... as young as they want , you mean . and i 'm not interested in whether thousands of people think i 'm six or six hundred-

how 's the new one coming ?

you disapprove of me when i 'm like this , do n't you ?

how about calling it a night ?

call , what call ?

then this will be five . i suppose you think i 'm too drunk to count .

but that was the fourth straight time .

i do n't know if this would be a wise move ...

give eve harrington job in you office .

all you got to do is name it .

this is real cooperation . i appreciate it .

i tell you what . why do n't i read with her ?

when 's the audition ?

the situation i 'm in ai n't the kind you can belch your way out . i made a promise ...

how about me what ?

make it bergdorf goodman ... and now everything is on its proper shelf , eh , max ? done up in little ribbons . i could die right now and nobody 'd be confused . how about you , max ?

you overslept ?

what was the mistake ? do you think it 's been rigged , all along the way , leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered ? they could n't have set us up better ; after all these months our credibility 's gone , you know what that means ?

-- deep throat wo n't confirm -- i never thought he was scared of anyone , but he 's scared of haldeman .

-- and the fbi confirms -- what more do you need ? --

-- jesus --

well , we are trying to ruin his life .

who ?

we 're inside the white house now .

what would you have done ?

-- haldeman i know , who else ?

then he 's got an ax . call him anyway .

-- i know , i know --

-- the lookout in the motor inn ? -- -- he say anything we do n't know ? --

we 'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it .

-- colson .

i could n't believe what she told me . eight cups of coffee worth .

you voted for him .

when ?

sure .

i just wish we knew when someone would talk to us , that 's all .

it 's not us , they were scared before we got there . what do we know ?

who 's first ?

-- she was panicked , carl -- every time i mentioned watergate , you could tell .

see her ? get anything ?

hmm .

right . nixon did n't get where he got by being dumb -- -- listen , that was a watergate question --

what , though ? it ca n't be the republicans -- he 'd never allow something as stupid as this , not when he 's gon na slaughter mcgovern anyway .

-- i 'm smart enough to know my story was solid --

-- they 're all the same , all those ivy league places -- they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you 're smart --

-- and you 've had some fucking meteoric rise , that 's for sure -- by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the montana bureau --

-- i have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from virginia ? --

-- what time is it ?

sir , i 'd like to ask you a few --

-- jeeeeeeesus --

what does it say ?

-- yeah , that was in the times this morning .

listen , i 've got a dinner -- ca n't we do this tomorrow ?

look , you 've been jerking my chain all day . if there 's some reason you ca n't talk to me -- like the fact that you 've already leaked everything to the new york times -- just say so .

good . just tell him i was here , that i 'm sorry i missed him --

well of course .

mr. dardis does call in every so often ?

i called him from washington . he 's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning .

i 'm so glad .

-- teddy kennedy ?

any idea what he did ?

-- howard hunt ?

i do n't know anything about haldeman , except , dwight 's frightened of him -- everybody 's frightened of him -- christ , i wish i 'd never gotten messed around with this -- all i wan na do is sit in the sun ; sit , swim , see some girls .

when you guys print it in the paper , then i 'll know . i 'm a lawyer , and i 'll probably go to jail , and be disbarred , and what did i do that was so awful ?

i did n't .

you wrote the canuck letter -- the one where you claimed muskie slurred the canadians .

do you feel much about the things you did ?

by `` they '' you mean ... ?

listen -- we know you 're involved in this -- we 're going to get the story , why not help ?

according to what we 've been able to verify , you 've been busy .

mind if i try ?

you ca n't .

i 'm carl bernstein . my paper sent me out to see if i could n't persuade you to go on the record .

donald segretti ?

-- what about you ? --

absolutely --

-- what ? --

i thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story -- -- you think i like being aced out ?

-- goddamnit , when 's somebody gon na go on the record on this story --

hey ... very tense .

oh , they 're here . i 'm keeping much better records now , hannah . see ?

if you do n't like it down there , why do n't you quit ?

-- you do n't really think you 're being followed ?

it was all so crazy -- the day after the break-in he gave us a speech , bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his -- gordon told us not to let jim mccord ruin everything -- do n't let one bad apple spoil the barrel , he said . you just know that when gordon liddy 's calling someone a bad apple , something 's wrong somewhere . ... it 's all so rotten ... and getting worse ... and all i care about is hugh sloan . his wife was going to leave him if he did n't stand up and do what was right . and he quit . he quit because he saw it and did n't want any part of it .

who were they ?

i never worked for sloan or stans .

you 've really got to go .

it was accurate , but i ca n't get a fuller listing for you -- all barker 's phone records have been subpoenaed .

something maybe big .

'cause i 'm not calling out from the phone company anymore -- -- i think the place is bugged .

-- let me put it this way : i 'd have no problem if you did .

what happens when the baby comes ?

ordinarily , though , what was the procedure ?

my non-denial denial .

what 's this ?

the fbi thinks it 's possible -- the democrats need a campaign issue , corruption 's always a good one . get off the story , ben -- or put some people on mcgovern 's finances ; fair is fair , even in our business .

i do n't think either metropolitan or national should cover the story . i do n't think we should cover the story , period .

electronic surveillance .

ok. you 're about to write a story that says that the former attorney general -- the man who represented law in america -- is a crook . just be right , huh ?

he approved the payments to liddy while he was still attorney general --

how senior ?

you do n't mind getting on people 's nerves , do you ?

i have nothing more to say .

it was really nice of you to come , since you 'd only met him once .

barker 's wife called me at three this morning ; her husband apparently had told her to call if he had n't called her by then .

a miami social occasion ? mr. rafferty told me the cubans were from miami .

what i do n't understand is how you got here .

mr. rafferty was very helpful . four cuban-americans and this other man , james mccord .

mr. caddy ? my name 's bob woodward , i 'm from the post and i wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case --

well , was it in a bar , her apartment , some restaurant --

that 's a bullshit question , that 's a question straight out of wichita , kansas .

you claiming it was all a misunderstanding , ken ?

i see . and how do you think it reached miami ?

the twenty-five thousand dollar one . the one with your name on it . in bernard barker 's florida account . bernard barker , the watergate burglar --

-- i know , i know , the pressure 's off the white house and it 's all back on the post --

fifty ratfuckers directed by the white house to destroy the democrats ?

how grand ?

there were more then .

i know what it means -- segretti would n't go on the record , but if he would , we know he 'd implicate chapin . and that would put us inside the white house .

what 's the whole thing about -- do you know ?

you changed cabs ? you 're sure no one followed you ?

follow the money . always follow the money .

if you do n't like them , why wo n't you be more concrete with me ?

i was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at watergate ?

hello , i 'm bob woodward of the washing post and ... mullen and company public relations ? could you tell me when you expect mr. hunt ? he is ?

where ?

government . recently retired .

it is .

and the underground garage one . would i know him ?

some justice department lawyers and an fbi man , and some people from the committee to re-elect , yes ma'am .

i think so .

-- correction -- when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the sans souci --

-- well , sloan --

-- who you got ? --

i never asked them about watergate . i only said what were hunt 's duties at the white house . they volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty .

just that on his office wall there 's a cartoon with a caption reading , `` when you 've got them by the balls , their hearts and minds will follow . ''

i ca n't sell hints to simons -- -- you called everyone you know ? call someone you do n't know .

the head of security for the reelection of a republican president got caught bugging the national offices of the democrats ? what the hell does that mean ?

then how come the associated press were the ones found out that mr. mccord is security coordinator for the committee to re-elect the president , otherwise known as creep ?

ok , get on this w.house guy and do a better job then you did on mccord .

that 's everything bachinski had , i think it 's worth following up .

two o'clock , work the phones 'til you go .

preliminary hearing at superior courthouse ?

where 's that cheery face we 've come to know and love ?

more denunciations ?

-- listen , i love this country , you think i want to bring it down ? -- i 'm not some goddamn zany , i was a hawk --

i can predict the next words you 're gon na say : `` anyone but bernstein . '' i want to send a reporter to miami .

he just did .

what do you think mrs. graham wants to see me for ?

-- no --

is n't that what you 'd expect them to say ?

-- look , when the watergate grand jury questioned you , did you name names ?

a girl . melissa .

go on .

colson 's too smart to get directly involved with something like that .

my wife told me to expect you . as you know , i have n't talked to the press .

i 'm not miss abbott .

i 'll do it .

well then keep it coming . alright , people , good work ! keep it up and we 'll do great at the state competition .

no , it was good .

sorry , coach .

you 're a killer , ozzy !

i 'm not good in math .

what did you just say ?

neither did i !

aged eighteen years . why do n't you get the glasses . behind the bar .

oh no , no date . bathroom incident .

nah . fuck , you guys are right , i do n't know what i 'm doing . i mean i 'm acting like i 've got it all together tonight . but i know vicky is gon na ask me if i love her . and i do n't know what i 'm gon na say . so now it 's like , maybe i 'll just wimp out on the whole thing .

easy , tiger . what 's in there ?

finch ! get to the bathroom ! now !

you know , jim ... you could go back there ... and ...

whatever you hear about me , you agree .

this . right now .

well , that 's what your friends call you . i mean ... i feel like i 'm one of your friends now ... and also ... your girlfriend .

what 's that ?

no . i 'm missing the game for you .

you 're missing the game for us ? !

so we 're gon na be close next year ?

i know . salt and pepper ?

yeah . so wow , you 've got it figured out .

so you 're going to michigan ?

how did you know i was here ?

give me a break , you 're so full of it .

i saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies .

no , i like the car . by the way , though , about prom ? that was like a bad idea . sorry i invited you .

you do n't like it ?

um ... chris --

just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience . you like , `` kicked butt . ''

oh ... well that 's okay . cool .

oh sure . i know what people think . it 's like , oz , he 's just this kickass lacrosse player -- i also play football , by the way -- but that 's like ... not < u > all < /u > that i am .

... i 've never tried it .

vicky , it 's not a space shuttle launch , it 's sex . so did you do the physics write-up ?

jessica ! he 'll drive there for me , and i 'll drive to ann arbor for him . we 're going to have sex when he 's ready and i 'm ready . it 's got to be completely perfect . i want the right place , the right time , the right moment .

what the hell are you expecting him to drive to vanderbilt for ? milk and cookies ?

duh . of course . naturally , i embellished a little bit . hey , did you hear that finch had sex with an older woman ?

i do n't get it , that really works ?

then what the hell are you talking about ?

i -- i do n't know , you ca n't ask me that .

you mean ... and orgasm ?

yeah , that 's right .

i do , baby , i do .

oh yeah , baby , i 'll give it to you .

he 's going in !

i 'll save you a seat .

well ... dammit , if i 'm doing this , how the hell am i gon na watch ?

i do n't get it . how does a guy like that get this sudden reputation ?

went home to shit .

hey , where 's finch ?

i have no idea . finch showers in a bathing suit .

what about you ? you 're the one with the girlfriend and you 're still stranded on third base .

at least now i know what the hell they 're saying .

it 's all good . breath check .

there 's our man .

nothing , i just hugged her back .

okay , okay . i 'll let you hit those books .

yes .

oh , okay . here 's let me show you .

these are for you . from father to son .

okay !

are you gon na do what i think you 're gon na do ?

well , this one time ? at band camp ? we were playing this game , i do n't know if you know it ? but it 's called spin the bottle ? and i had to kiss this guy named marc wander on the lips ? and ...

are they gross or something , like guy stuff ? tell me .

stifler 's mom got it in the divorce .

okay . michelle , do you want to be my date for the prom ?

hold on . you have no idea why i 'm angry ?

after high school .

i 'll just say that we had a great night together .

no . her sponsors here saw the thing on the net . i do n't think they liked it .

oh that 's really reassuring . and do n't call me nova anymore . i 'm a fraud .

hey , you did better than i did , nova .

so let 's say you get there ... what 's uh , third base feel like ?

shortstop . 'course , you do n't make it to third , and you 're out .

no -- kevin , you ?

c-span ?

illegal channels ? shit , if there 's any channel that should be illegal , it 's whatever that women 's channel is . lifetime supply of pantyhose , or some shit .

you 've got something going ?

yes , slowly .

shame on you !

do you mind ? this fabric is so uncomfortable .

i suppose that would be okay .

yes . no . yes .

me ?

i know . let 's go . do n't you have something to tell your friends ?

no , kevin -- that 's the whole thing , that 's what i 've been realizing . that nothing 's perfect , that you ca n't plan everything .

i ca n't believe we just had our senior prom .

yeah .

i want to hear you say it .

so , do you want to be -- i mean , how do you want to do it ?

yeah , right here .

you comfortable ?

see -- this is the nicest room .

about the other day ... i 've been thinking .

i know , vick . i 'm just not ready yet , okay ?

it 's everyone 's trick , kevin . but i did pick it up from you .

you 're not doing the extra credit problems .

just a second !

oh kevin -- do n't stop !

not for you .

vicky -- do you think , maybe ... it 's time for us to take the next step in our relationship ?

you got in .

`` dear ms. hughes . we 're sorry , but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months , we 've decided you are now rejected . enclosed is a 100-page , full-color brochure on how rejected you are . ''

you think so ?

whoop , you 're fading out . good luck at that party .

what ? not < u > the < /u > bible ?

yeah , but we 'll still see each other .

i guess we 'll call you two-ply .

attitude ? me ? i think that < u > you < /u > guys should be more enthusiastic . shit , we 've been trying to get laid forever , and tonight 's the night we 've been waiting for . we 're in this together . do n't back out on me now !

dammit , kevin , what 's with the attitude ?

what reputation ?

nah , you get kind of dizzy though .

feeling better , oz ?

and little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly , and asked me if i needed i ri-hide --

you got something up your sleeve for tonight , finch ?

you ever hear of something called the bible ?

our last game is this saturday .

come on , you know the words , sing along .

oh my fucking god . you 're gay .

she works part-time at my dad 's store .

bullshit . from where ?

you coming to party tonight , ostreicher , ya fuckface ?

yep .

god , i ca n't believe there are so many cool people at this party .

i mean , if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you , and then manage to eat it 's heart , the curse is lifted . i was gon na tell you but marcel would n't let me .

also like sex with my wife .

just like sex with my wife .

hanging is nice . never goes out of style . what about hare-kare - a taste of the orient ? but no ! you 're in paris ! try the guillotine ! there 's one in the louvre !

hey , you ca n't kick me ! you 're an apparition !

rip my face off ? hey , we all make mistakes . hell , i did n't mean to sleep with you on the first night , especially without a condom . but i did , and now i 'm paying the price .

no it is n't ! you 're dead !

face it boyfriend . this is really happening .

thanks for the lovely evening , shithead !

i do n't know ... surprise me .

up to there ? really ? i bet i could beat that .

okay . be careful .

pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers .

after the revolution , the paris cemeteries overflowed . they dug up all the old bodies and brought them here . seven million people . mostly very poor .

what does it say ?

no . we have to try . we 'll figure something out . and if midnight comes before we can get to him , well , then we go together . deal ? shake a paw ?

we do n't both have to die .

here ! come on ! do it ! go ahead .

shut up ! you fucking shut up ! what do you want ? huh ? what the hell do you want ?

what was i ? your idea of a fuckin ' hors d'oeuvre ? huh ?

that 's the scar where i stabbed you ! oh god ... you deliberately took me down there so you could ... god , i ca n't believe it !

it was you ... that night in the tunnels . you . you did this to me .

i ... i did n't think you would ... i 'm sorry ... i believed that son-of-a- bitch ...

before hemingway , there was starsky and hutch .

guess that 's why he hid it there . let 's go .

they 're coming !

listen , either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what 's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims . he 's a mcdermott . i know what his choice would be .

a cure ?

i know . he told me .

i 'm not alright . we both know that . the only reason i 'm here now is to warn you . you 're still in danger . gaston told me that claude has got the curse too . he 's a werewolf .

where did you go last night ? what did you do ?

no , i do n't think so ... i was having a nightmare . wait a second ...

professor roussel . there 's something wrong with you . i know it .

i 'll be right back . stay put .

that 's what counts . if you 're not passionate about it , do n't waste your time . that 's why i quit college ... plus i 'm a lazy bastard . wait , i know this ... a votre sante .

what about your glasses ?

i know ! let 's go hock loogies off the eiffel tower !

andy ! holy shit !

andy !

hey , i 'm new here , what do you want ?

where 's the adm ? where did your uncle put it ?

but ... i do n't remember anything , i swear ...

it killed him ... you coulda just used draino . it 's cheaper .

my god ! serafine 's right . it 's time to go . we 'll talk soon .

terrence and i came down here to do serious work . for centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate .

andy ...

yeah , well , why did he hang out here ? the cops said it 's dangerous -

undead . right . sort of an ectocosmic manifestation . what a pisser . tell you one thing though , timothy leary will be jealous as hell .

yeah . i guess so . did he say anything ? before the coma ?

right . listen , my uncle , it 's not serious is it ? did he eat some bad snails ? slip on the bidet ? what ?

enough . cut him loose .

i 'm telling you . it 's not drugs . it 's something more . someth -

no , it 's no cure . it 's something much more interesting .

god , well do n't let him go ! catch him !

allo ?

you think that 's what mcdermott was raving about in the ambulance ?

you better follow that mcdermott kid . he 's going to wind up like his uncle if he 's not careful .

twelve thirty-six a.m. here . twelve forty a.m. here . there 's two of them . at least .

okay . so maybe you were right .

well ?

merde .

dmitri ?

yes - if i ca n't convince sophie , i 'll never be able to see tatiana ... .

it 's okay . did n't hurt..

well , the only thing you 've got when you 've got a home is a fear of losing it ! you 're lucky you do n't remember the revolution -- i never had much , but what i did have -- i lost .

it used to be a private yacht before the government took it over .

... fish fork , salad fork , meat fork and . . . [ this section also not ledgable ]

natasha ! natasha feastavich ! - but we called her nashie fooshie !

you never said anything to me about having to prove i 'm a princess !

just what do you think you 're doing ? !

that 's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs ... stretch then that way .

by pulling my hair ? !

perhaps it 's because she has amnesia too - ca n't remember . . .

you ca n't go back to find your home . your home is in your heart , in the future that you make for yourself .

i wanted to come home , grandmama - and i did . i came back to my home with you .

is it ? is this what you want ?

`` if '' i accept ? ! of course i 'm going to accept ! it 's what i always wanted !

dmitri did n't want the money ?

no , not about the ceremony , anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make .

anastasia ! it was just a bat ! it 's gone , dear ...

parse holds the key to my heart french- bat- chicks hang out at montmartre we 'll eat some in-sects then go back and have --

what do you think is the most humiliating way to die ?

my aunt bella , sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up , anyway she always said `` curses were made to be broken '' . course , she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks , so it was n't quite so profound ...

i cursed then all !

how do you know ?

i gave you that tongue and i can rip it out !

and what do you want , my little rat-with-wings ?

what ?

what do you mean ?

life is funny , is n't it . you find the right girl ... and then you lose her .

but it 's not the money , vlad .

yes . and i hate that in a woman .

royalty do not help people with their luggage .

wake up , young lady , that 's our train .

she does n't want to do anything `` dishonest '' . . .

what was that ?

it 's no use , dmitri - we 'll never find the right girl !

run , anya - go ...

oh , dmitri.i wish that i could .

young man , i ...

oh !

you mean they give awards for that kind o ' music ?

the grammys . he 's got a lotta records up for awards .

you mean that ... i-i-i-i flew three thousand miles to see you .

alvy , i ca n't say that that 's true at this point in my life . i really just ca n't say that that 's true . i mean , you know how wonderful you are . i mean , you know ... you 're the reason that i got outta my room and that i was able to sing , and-and- and , you know , get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap . anyway , look , i do n't wanna- listen , listen , listen , uh h ' h , so whatta you up to anyway , huh ?

no . yes , of course i 'm mad , because you love me , i know that .

you 're mad , are n't you ?

yeah , and i-i tru- you know , i trust her , because my-my analyst recommended her .

right . geez , i feel like there 's a great weight off my back . m'mmm .

god .

this is the first book that i got you .

oh-

there 's no-no question in my mind . i think we 're doing the mature thing , without any doubt .

alvy , uh , let 's face it . you know something , do n't think our relationship is working .

it 's wonderful . i mean , you know they just watch movies all day .

oh , good . okay .

really ? and what is the kick of it ? because i never ...

... i 'm thrilled . as you know , uh ... uh , on my agent 's advice i sold out , and i 'm gon na do an appearance on tv .

oh , i 'm sure it 's a lot of fun , 'cause the incas did it , you know , and-and they-they-they were a million laughs .

but the thing is-i mean , since our discussions here , i feel i have a right to my own feelings . i think you woulda been happy because ... uh , uh , i really asserted myself .

what 's ... you ... well , what 's the matter , you w- wan na go to that party ?

remember , we had that thing .

you were-you were sensational . i mean , i-you know , i-i told yuh that if yuh stuck to it , you would be great , and-and , you know , i-i-you- you were sensational .

here 's a real present .

try it ... it 'll add years to our sex life .

well , i had a really good day , you know that ? it was just a real fine way to spend my birthday .

okay , okay . okay .

it 's all right for me , it 's been terrific , you know ? better than either one of my marriages . see , 'cause ... 'cause there 's just something different about you . i do n't know what it is , but it 's great .

yeah .

was there somebody in your room when i called you ?

oh , yeah . oh . oh ! alvy ?

two ?

two ... yeah . lotta , lotta trouble . there 's two of 'em .

very big spider .

is he in the bathroom ?

yeah , where is the spider ?

hey , what am i-your son ? whatta you mean ? i-i came over to --

well , i like to try to get all points of view .

no .

oooh .

i just think we oughta call this relationship quits !

i 'm following you and david , if you-

david ! david ! i ca n't believe this !

a bit rapidly . i do n't care what you say about david , he 's a perfectly fine teacher !

adult education is such junk ! the professors are so phony . how can you do it ?

you said , `` will it change ... '' wife . will it change ...

well , she said that i should probably come five times a week . and you know something ? i do n't think i mind analysis at all . the only question is , will it change my wife ?

whatta you mean ? me ?

yeah .

m'hm .

and i did n't have to lie down on the couch , alvy , she had me sitting up . so i told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother .

hey , do n't knock masturbation ! it 's sex with someone i love .

oh , stop it . but you were having an affair with your college professor . that jerk that teaches that incredible crap course `` contemporary crisis in western man '' !

that is the worst kind of paranoia .

paranoid ? i 'm looking at you . you got your arms around another guy .

do you realize how paranoid you are ?

yeah , but that 's not-that 's no good . i want the whole thing .

i do n't know , but you seem sort of distant .

i do n't know . you- it 's like you're- you 're removed .

what are you doing ?

oh , come , you do n't need that .

it relaxes me .

well , have you ever made love high ?

just do n't take any course where they make you read beowulf .

does this sound like a good course ? uh , `` modern american poetry '' ? uh , or , uh-let 's see now ... maybe i should , uh , take `` introduction to the novel . ''

that place is four hundred dollars a month ?

you do n't want me to live with you ?

yeah , but you-you got a nice apartment .

yeah .

oh , well , let 's see , there was dennis , from chippewa falls high school .

it 'll make great- alvy , be- alvy , it 'll be wonderful ... ooooh , lovely !

great ! great ! goddammit ! ooooh ! these are ... p-p-p-pick this lobster up . hold it , please !

gim me ! gim me ! let me do it ! what- what 's he think we 're gon na do , take him to the movies ?

oh , all right . all right ! it 's all right . here .

well , maybe we should just call the police . dial nine-one-one , it 's the lobster squad .

look , i told you it was a ... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house .

i mean , you 've been married before , you know how things can get . you were very hot for allison at first .

i know . well , alvy , it 'll pass , it 'll pass , it 's just that i 'm going through a phase , that 's all .

boy , those guys in the french resistance were really brave , you know ? got to listen to maurice chevalier sing so much .

i-i-i mean , i 'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in brooklyn .

i know- because of our sexual problem , right ?

oh , come on , we 've seen it . i 'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on nazis .

alright . all right , all right , so whatta you wan na do ?

i 'm not getting my period . jesus , every time anything out of the ordinary happens , you think that i 'm getting my period !

deal ! i 'm dealing with two guys named cheech !

you 're gon na hafta learn to deal with it .

i tell you this because , as an artist , i think you 'll understand . sometimes when i 'm driving ... on the road at night ... i see two headlights coming toward me . fast . i have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly , head-on into the oncoming car . i can anticipate the explosion . the sound of shattering glass . the ... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline .

can i confess something ?

oh , yeah ? terrific .

oh , hi , duane , how 's it goin ' ?

what 'd i do ?

jesus !

oswald and ghosts .

i ca n't .

well , i ca n't li- we ca n't have this discussion all the time . the country makes me nervous . there 's ... you got crickets and it-it 's quiet ... there 's no place to walk after dinner , and ... uh , there 's the screens with the dead moths behind them , and ... uh , yuh got the-the manson family possibly , yuh got dick and terry-

there are people out there from the new yorker magazine . my god ! what would they think ?

what 's fascinating is that it 's physical . you know , it 's one thing about intellectuals , they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what 's going on . but on the other hand ... the body does n't lie , as-as we now know .

no jokes-these are friends , okay ?

i 'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for dysentery .

oh , tsch , thank you . h 'm .

oh , sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience .

oh , no , no , do n't be ... tsch ... do n't be silly . you know , i 'm startin ' it-i 'm startin ' to get some feeling back in my jaw now .

yeah .

i can think of another word .

you have a raccoon ?

man , that 's great . that 's just great .

oh , do yuh ?

it 's a narrow view .

probably on their first date , right ?

hey .

pick up the license . you have to ask nicely 'cause i 've had an extremely rough day . you know , my girl friend-

yeah . right .

oh , he-he did n't say anything .

if she comes over here , max , my brain is going to turn into guacamole .

m'hm .

visible panty line . max , she is gorgeous .

whee , you shoulda told me it was tony lacey 's party .

you like this house , max ?

we do the show live in front of an audience .

look , now , charlie , give me a big laugh here .

while you 're out here , max , i want you to see some of my tv show . and we 're invited to a big christmas party .

yes , i remember . he was all schoolyard . they threw him a football once , he tried to dribble it .

you 'll total the whole car .

sun is bad for yuh . everything our parents said was good is bad . sun , milk , red meat , college ...

max , if we lived in california , we could play outdoors every day , in the sun .

but the- i 'm not discussing politics or economics . this is foreskin .

right , right , so g-get back to what we were discussing , the failure of the country to get behind new york city is-is anti-semitism .

max , my serve is gon na send yuh to the showers-

no , i can not . you keep bringing it up , but i do n't wan na live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light .

we move to sunny l.a. all of show business is out there , max .

forget it , max .

let 's get the hell outta this crazy city .

ah .

stop calling me max .

ah , max , you , uh ...

you 're crazy !

she 's a colored woman , from harlem !

all right-so we can afford it .

she was stealing .

well , yeah , you always look pretty , but that guy with you ...

then there was jerry , the actor .

if only i did n't feel guilty asking annie to move out . it 'd probably wreck her . but i should be honest .

if only i had the nerve to break up , but it would really hurt him .

we 're going to take them to the airport .

you think so ? do you really ?

oh , he 's adorable , annie .

oh , yes , yes .

oh , that randolph hunt . you remember randy hunt , annie . he was in the choir with you .

we really had a good time .

i do n't know . i do n't know .

just ... that 's all you need . you can come and stay here .

oh , gosh .

it was a wonderful set .

and we could just sit and talk ... nothing . uh , not a big deal , it 's just relax , just be very mellow .

well , hey , that 's , that 's nice . uh . oh , listen , this is , uh , alvy singer . do you know alvy ? uh ... and ... uh ... tony lacey .

uh , well , i 'd like to talk to you about that sometime , if you get a chance .

tessie , they say you were the sister with personality .

it 's the way they do things .

one guess .

five years ago , i was at the party , remember ?

you 've got a lot of fucking gall . thirty nine .

leo . leo 's twenty-eight , cal .

leo ? it was out to jude law . jude passed .

who , sally ?

i do n't know what 's going on . i do n't care to guess . mac 's really unhappy . she is n't there , that 's all . she 's no idea what she 's playing , not a clue .

oh , she 's really enjoying it . i think . is mac okay ?

is n't skye amazing ?

can we ... one at a time ? hold it down , and one at a time . you 're last , cal .

it has your ring .

jack . did you compose that yourself ?

honey ?

what what 's about ?

you 're coming swimming in the pool , and in a few minutes you wo n't even remember what it 's about . you wo n't care who 's in your damn movie .

or i wo n't . i ca n't help her . i 'm out of my depth .

how nice for everybody . come swimming . the water 's glorious . you 'll fix it . you 'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas .

it 's always not this time . if you can do it around me , you can do it around anyone .

not this time .

thank you , thank you , thank you .

it 's not going to come up .

you need to knock off the pills , clair .

borrow whatever you like .

oh .

to dander . otis .

oh .

why did n't you bring him ?

this is monica and ryan . mac and clair .

of course .

what a fucking day ! we only just got a sitter . i do n't know her from fucking adam . she could be a serial killer . i 'm going to have to call every ten minutes . you have to let me give out the number .

i 'm glad that 's all over for me .

take good care of it .

damn straight .

jesus , sally . i 'm not the enemy .

i told his father he 'd be on that flight .

he 's not going tonight .

yeah .

i love her too , joe .

would you leave us alone right now ?

i 've booked you a flight and packed you a bag . you just need to get into a car and go .

harry called .

what is it ?

when does he graduate high school ?

can i open it ?

damn near . and a damn near perfect drug .

oh jesus oh jesus oh jesus .

do you want me to save you ? do you want me to save you ?

are you my big brave boy ? are you my brave hero ?

well it 's fucking time .

i know we 're early , we 're so early . sorry .

i 'm fine , babe .

go .

whatever you say .

we 'll be fine .

he gets huge advances on his novels . he 's going back to that . you know how he hates it here .

i worry because you do n't . it 's my job . i 'm feeling guilty . i would 've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground .

what you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in london , it 's an outrageously expensive city .

we closed .

oh , sally mae ...

me too .

life gets messy . ugly messy . but i do n't understand you . and i do n't think i ever understood lucy . i do n't understand throwing it away . how do you throw all that away ? any of it . i want it all . you guys want guarantees ? i want the possibilities . and all kinds of crap comes with that . a lot of bad shit . and i think that 's okay with me because , because of the rest of the stuff . all the good shit . all the surprises . it 's a fucking miracle when you come down to it . we 'd have had amazing children , you and me . we 'd have had a ride . you 'd have surprised yourself . i 'll never love anybody else , you know .

i guess .

pretty much a disaster , tonight , was n't it ?

you do n't have to .

i 'll never forgive you .

do n't make allowances . i 'll never be ready . some people just should n't have children . i 'd be a terrible fucking mother , joe . i did want it for us . but i could n't do it . i do n't really think i can do it .

i 'm a monster . exactly .

you changed your mind .

i told you when we met i never wanted children . i do n't want kids in my life . we talked about it . you were n't listening .

do n't do this .

this is insanity . sally ...

anyone else ?

mac ? mac says it ? cal ?

your director and your co-star of your current movie . do n't dish if you ca n't take it , sally .

who ? who ? who thinks that ?

and how fucking dare you cast skye davidson in that part ? have you any idea how humiliating that is for me ? i 'm an actress ! it 's about our marriage for fuck 's sake . everybody knows that ...

that is not true .

you want to talk about bullshit ? lucy called you three times this week . she 's a fucking mess , joe . your sister is a fucking mess . she needs you . i talk to her more than you do .

and how hard it hit ?

you walked out on a five year marriage .

otis ! come ! good boy ! come !

jesus , sally . you are a medical miracle . the only person who 's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier .

oh fuck you , and fuck monica while you 're at it . but i guess that 's what i interrupted .

listen to yourself ... do n't worry , it 's alright . we 'll find him . what 's wrong with you ?

i think we should all take it tonight . everyone 's staying , stays . no driving . that 's the rule . i love you sally-mae . you 're going to have a fabulous time .

whatever ! you know how he gets . well , he went absolutely bonkers . lucy and i were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and i did n't fit any more . it was almost fatal . and that , my dear friends , is the day ...

i 'm not fucking angry , for god 's sake .

it 's alright . be our guests .

who 'd like to go and find otis ?

in the kitchen .

of course we do . we have to sign our taxes .

i 'll say as little as possible .

really ?

i 'm looking forward to meeting you , too . and skye , i 'm thrilled that you 're willing to take this leap with me . eternally grateful , really .

skye ! i 'm so glad you 're able to make it ... it 's our sixth , actually . you read the book again ? well , no , the ending to chapter six ... it 's just that it 's not filmic . we tried it in an earlier draft , but , it just was n't filmic ... well , sure , we can absolutely look at that again . if you 're coming from laurel , you want to take sunset west , we 're just past will rogers state park . three blocks west of that , you want to hang right . it 's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left .

and she 's a stinking fucking actress , for fuck 's sake .

no , no of course not . how old is she ? twenty-fucking-two ?

what ?

we 're great .

in the morning , after everyone 's gone and there 's just us .

accept a compliment .

i love you . most beautiful woman in the world .

no luck .

oh , you know , i am .

you manage to throw me off balance . i adore you .

yes i know . i started to say ... i started to say joe that --

do n't be silly .

i do n't know why joe , we 've known each other how long ...

i 'm not much of a reader , but i do love autobiographies , even biographies sometimes . mostly non-fiction . did you read the new styron ?

oh . well . good .

nothing that ca n't be exchanged .

oh do n't . everyone says that .

no . no . let me tell you something . directing 's the best preparation possible for fatherhood . the sleep depravation alone .

oh . you 're serious .

i meant sally .

well , you know ... good days , bad days .

kind of . hey , look - john seale , oliver stapelton , darius khonji - they 're friends . and great dp 's i could give them a call for you .

it was a mistake . this is n't a plot to do in otis .

yeah , it was . for a writer nothing 's sacred . no , nothing at all .

lemon .

lemon or raspberry ?

what am i , five ?

sally ! ! ! !

we 're way past inappropriate .

oh shit . i 'm sorry . i 'm a total fucking maniac . delete all that , okay ? i spoke for myself , this need n't rub off on my wife . oh shit . i get pissy sometimes . much worse than otis . otis does n't bite . it 's just , i really love my dog and he does n't really bark a lot . we live in a canyon . we hear dogs barking at night , too . and it 's not otis .

and your phone calls are nasty and abusive . and i 've come this close to suing you for harassment . and you 're only here because we 're supposed to be sucking up to you .

but you 're very private people . you know , there 's a kind of elitism ...

what ?

uh-huh .

your eames table is incredible . and the b & b . i just put that in a client 's home , actually , but in red .

no , he 's absolutely right . you 're absolutely right , ryan . dog talk must be banned . canine conversations are completely discouraged ... it 's really good of you to join us . can i get you a drink ?

you 're going to be a remarkable director , a brilliant director .

when i read your work i felt that you knew me . women must tell you that . and this one in particular speaks to me , do you know ? i am genna . how many women must tell you that . and the script is wonderful . wonderful and lean and visual ...

not good .

how 's he doing ?

trust him .

jesus christ , it 's a fucking dog !

because we 're nice people , and because what goes around comes around . because , god help you if something happens to that dog ?

are you making an ass of yourself ?

yes .

you know what sally therrian was saying about your spine and your brain ? she did n't pull that out of thin air . it causes brain damage . you 'd better drink a lot of water .

he always has two or three going ...

ryan .

i ...

you fucking cow , ca n't you read ? !

i 'm sorry .

i did it .

yes . and you 've met joe .

who told you that ? no . i 'm twenty ... five .

how about someone who really really liked shostakovich ?

if he were still alive , maybe .

otis ! ! shostakovich identified with the jew . he felt persecuted , hunted , crushed under the thumb of stalinist imperialism .

i was impressed .

not at all .

what did i do ?

thank you , panes .

you 're my best friend .

why not ?

no , really , five thousand with your discount .

you 're a shit .

`` we ca n't stand seeing you like this , panes . i hate you being alone . why do n't you stay with us for a while ? '' `` i 'd love to , thanks . ''

oh , okay , forgive me . your neighbors are here , for fuck 's sake .

you see , that 's worse .

oh great .

i did n't know you had this .

rose .

well today it was otis . and you should keep him away from our yard . because sheila will defend herself .

well , so glad you decided to come .

i 'll be right out .

oh my god , sorry . i 'm interrupting .

his image of you is a possessive , fragile neurotic .

you were n't exactly horrified .

cal knows who he is . did you notice how happy joe was when the drugs came out tonight ?

oh soph ...

the both of you .

hm .

she 's such a great photographer .

yes .

would you like to meet my husband ?

nevermind .

he 's a novelist .

who cares , z. all i know is , we got ta dig . we 're not the ones in charge .

break 's over .

are you asking me out to dinner ?

i do n't know what came over me , talking back like that . i must be going crazy ...

you miss him ? < u > why < /u > ?

well you 'll never be able to hurt him where he is now . i miss him already .

well ... i declared war !

well , i ... i know it 's a little strange , but ... i thought it might come in handy if i ... needed a scarf someday . well , to be honest , i just liked having it .

so ... you never did tell me ... what made you come out to the worker bar that night ?

forget it . you go ahead , i give up . i ... i do n't know what i was thinking . `` insectopia '' .

yes ?

z ... if we do n't make it ... i just want you to know ... .

we 've found it ! < u > insectopia < /u > ! look at all this food '

so what makes you so special ?

wait , i hear something !

come on -- it 's gone ! what are the chances of that happening again ?

water ... water ...

well i guess that makes us even .

who 's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped , or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot ?

how should < u > i know < /u > ?

sshh ! ! ! sshh ! ! !

gee , uh , could you say it a little louder , i think there are some ants in the next colony who did n't hear you .

no ... as a matter of fact ...

no weirdly ... you remind me of someone ...

i 'm princess bala .

uh oh . goodbye ! got ta run !

are n't you gon na stand up for yourself ?

you watch yours , soldier , or my worker friend will beat you up !

why ca n't i just do whatever i want to do ? why ca n't i just go wild ? ! yahoo !

are you sure this is a real dance ?

so uh -- how come i have n't seen you around here before ?

we should n't be doing this -- it is n't proper !

the club 's so < u > stuffy < /u > . i want to try someplace different .

do n't make my mistake , kid ... do n't ... be a grunt ... your whole life ...

no , no , you 're ... lookin ' good . you 've got good color in your cheeks .

be honest , kid -- am i hurt bad ?

attack ? but -- i hate attacking ! it 's so hostile !

ant team six ...

well , uh , who notices workers , sir ?

i 've never seen anything like it , general , they 're they 're ... well , look !

dammit , this tunnel is priority a-1 ! we ca n't afford < u > any delays < /u > on this project !

actually , sir , we 're ahead of schedule . we have thirty-six seconds available right now .

that 's correct , sir !

oh , no , sir !

yeah ... i mean ... well ... i do n't know , really , sir .

in love ? i 'm just a plain old soldier at heart . i 'll tell you what i love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders ... and the company of other warriors .

engaged ? as in you 're getting married ?

well she better -- she 's engaged to one . < u > me < /u > !

damn , i 'm proud of you , boy . i wish i had a hundred ants of your caliber . the world would tremble . now , time for some r and r. you 're invited to the royal victory party !

your majesty , i 'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony .

look , general ! a darling baby soldier ! do n't try to be a hero ! just make sure you come back in one piece ! next !

we are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory ...

general , the severe food shortage that faces the colony ... < u > pains < /u > me . the thought of any of my children going hungry ... who 's the cutest widdle worker ? you are ! yes , you ! do n't forget to brush your teeth ! ship 'er out . what steps are you taking to remedy the situation ?

... ants ...

what do you see out there ?

you 're a real buddy .

well i 'm gon na < u > start < /u > doing things for you ...

well , you just sit here and be a party-pooper .

and all the time i 've known you , you 've been grumping and groaning . you should quit making waves . go with the flow .

of course . you were born two seconds after me .

did you see that ? how he gave < u > you < /u > the beers , not me ? i 'm telling you , he 's got something against workers .

that 's sweet . that 's real sweet .

i 'm getting lonely . who are you talking to , anyway ?

so what are you waiting for -- a singing commercial ?

i did n't really do anything -- honest -- i mean , you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you 're serious -- marriage-wise .

from me the doctor has no secrets . poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that ?

oh . hello there , mrs. dreyfuss .

where are you going ? bud who knows ? another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- i 'm on my own .

of course not .

i 'm fine .

for that matter , you were wrong about me , too . what you said about those who take and those who get took ? well , mr. sheldrake was n't using me -- i was using him . see ? last month i was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now i 'm on the twenty-seventh floor , paneled office , three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we 're both getting what we want .

oh , miss kubelik . how do you feel ?

we 're going to finish that gin game .

you do n't have to if you do n't want to --

what ?

the dishes ?

you know what we 're going to do after dinner ?

you know , i used to live like robinson crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people . then one day i saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were -- it 's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two .

it 's a must -- gracious-living-wise .

no -- just come as you are .

so let 'em . look , i 'm going to cook dinner for us . we 'll have the fruit cake for dessert . you just sit there and rest . you 've done enough for one day .

no , thanks . the fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how i found out .

yeah . took me a year before i could bend my knee -- but i got over the girl in three weeks . she still lives in cincinnati , has four kids , gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every christmas .

in the knee ?

no , i do n't .

i know how you feel , miss kubelik . you think it 's the end of the world -- but it 's not , really . i went through exactly the same thing myself .

i really ought to be getting home . my family will be flipping by now .

i know so . he 's a taker .

i guess so .

it 's just that i 'm the kind of guy who ca n't say no -- i do n't mean to girls -- i mean --

as a matter of fact , i 'm a pretty good cook -- but i 'm a lousy housekeeper .

i was washing my stockings , so i decided i might as well do your socks .

sure . what 's that funny smell ?

yeah . well -- that 's the way it crumbles , cookie-wise . go to sleep .

please , miss kubelik , you got to promise me you wo n't do anything foolish .

just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne . like some ?

who was that ?

miss kubelik , i do n't think that 's such a good idea .

you are ?

mr. sheldrake ? oh , yes . very .

cut .

pick a card .

i do n't want it .

sure .

there 's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill .

yes , i 've got it . do n't you think we 'd better destroy it ? so it wo n't fall into the wrong hands -- ?

oh , i do n't mind . as a matter of fact , i 'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me .

he 's a liar . but that 's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- i still love him .

i did n't mean it that way -- i was just talking to him on the phone -- he 's very concerned about you .

but they 'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --

they had to pump it out .

as soon as i can walk .

miss .

what 's her first name ?

baxter .

i just want to go brush my teeth --

do n't you remember ? we were at the office party together --

all right . have a nice christmas .

i thought maybe i could put in a word for you with mr. sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter ?

i 'd better get back to my elevator . i do n't want to be fired .

much better .

i should n't drink when i 'm driving .

you could n't help yourself . i mean , when you 're having a drink with one man , you ca n't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man . you did the only decent thing .

what cold ? and after the show , we could go out on the town -- i 've been taking from arthur murray .

well , it was just an idea -- i hate to see a ticket go to waste --

i 'm afraid not . i promised to have a drink with him -- he 's been calling me all week --

this date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious ?

oh . you mean -- like a girl-friend ?

sure .

great . look -- have you seen the music man ?

i hope so . would n't you know they 'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything -- how do i look ?

you 're beginning to sound like mr. kirkeby already .

i 'm warning you , mr. baxter -- this is a respectable house , not a honky-tonky . come on , oscar .

i 'm sorry , mrs. lieberman -- and i 'll never invite those people again .

so who did you think it was -- kris kringle ? what was going on here last night ?

now hold on , baxter --

that 's right , mr. sheldrake . i wo n't be needing it -- because i 'm all washed up around here .

but this is the key to the executive washroom .

baxter , i picked you for my team because i thought you were a bright young man . you realize what you 're doing ? not to me -- but to yourself . normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again . you dig ?

what do you mean , sorry ?

now i 'll have to borrow your key .

i suppose you 'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating ?

yes , sir .

i got kicked in the head , too .

you like ? it 's all yours .

that 's right . i 've moved out of my house -- i 'm going to be staying in town , at the athletic club .

mr. sheldrake , i 've got good news for you --

oh . well , if there 's anything i can do for you --

no , thank you , mr. sheldrake . as a matter of fact , i 've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --

hello ? -- yes -- what 's on your mind , baxter ?

yeah . you know , baxter , i envy you . bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches , no complications --

no , sir . that 's very unfair -- especially to your wife .

yes , sir . you ca n't be too careful .

oh , yes . very attractive . is she -- the lucky one ?

i like the way you handled that . well , how does it feel to be an executive ?

oh , yes , sir . very much . and i want to thank you --

not that i have anything to hide .

now remember , baxter -- this is going to be our little secret .

thank you , sir .

oh -- terribly sorry . it 's that cold --

i am ?

that 's good thinking , baxter . next month there 's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as i 'm concerned , you 're executive material .

oh ? oh !

it also says here -- that you are alert , astute , and quite imaginative --

so do i -- i 'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --

well , that 's very kind of you -- only i 'm not feeling well -- you see , i have this cold -- and i thought i 'd go straight home .

i made other plans . you can have both tickets .

yes , sir .

how do you work it with the key ?

west 67th street . you have no idea what i 've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --

where is your apartment ?

oh , it wo n't . believe me . and it 's not going to happen again . from now on , nobody is going to use my apartment --

just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually , we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise .

oh .

loyal , cooperative , resourceful c. c. baxter .

who ?

would you mind repeating the question ?

and mr. kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime .

yes , mr. sheldrake .

what 's the matter with miss kubelik ?

all we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --

okay , get your clothes on . i got the cab downstairs .

now will you get out ?

look , you ca n't stay here . just take your champagne and go .

baxter , we 're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise .

instead of friday -- could you possibly switch to thursday ? you 'd be doing me a great favor --

listen to him . little lord fauntleroy !

that kubelik -- boy ! would i like to get her on a slow elevator to china .

yes , sir . they are indeed .

i know . mr. eichelberger -- in the mortgage loan department -- last night he had a little halloween party here --

sure , sure . look , kid -- i put in a good word for you with sheldrake , in personnel .

listen , baxter , we made you and we can break you .

well , after all , it 's my apartment -- it 's private property -- it 's not a public playground .

we went to bat for you -- and now you wo n't play ball with us .

teamwork -- that 's what counts in an organization like this . all for one and one for all -- know what i mean ?

it is ? well , how about that ? no wonder i could n't get into the executive washroom this morning .

oh , i found a key there , all right -- only it 's the wrong key .

oh , buddy-boy . i was just about to call you . i 'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall . you see , my little friend , she kept insisting picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but i 'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil .

yes , mr. dobisch .

buddy-boy -- she wo n't keep that long -- not even on ice . listen , kid , i ca n't pass this up -- she looks like marilyn monroe .

yeah .

buddy-boy , that 's the worst thing you can do . if you got a cold , you should go to a turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --

happy new year .

sorry to lose you , baxter .

i do n't know . all i know is i got to get out of this place .

a mansch -- a human being ! so you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --

i 'm not sure .

well , as a doctor , i guess i ca n't prove it was n't an accident . but as your neighbor , i 'd like to kick your keester clear around the block . mind if i cool this off ?

are n't you ?

she did n't mean it , doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she did n't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me , doc , i 'm not thinking about myself --

why do you want to know , doc ? you do n't have to report this , do you ?

kubelik -- with two k 's .

well -- we work in the same building -- and we try to keep it quiet --

miss kubelik -- fran .

want to tell me what happened ?

get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it is n't too late . you better put some coffee on -- and pray .

it was half-full -- about a dozen or so . you going to have to take her to the hospital ?

she going to be all right , doc ?

my body ? i 'm afraid you guys would be disappointed . good night , doc .

you know , baxter -- i 'm doing some research at the columbia medical center -- and i wonder if you could do us a favor ?

oh . 'bye , doc .

say , what 's going on here , anyway ?

the party 's over .

i 'm with you , lover .

well , they have n't got me yet , baby . dig up some ice from the kitchen and let 's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise .

i do n't know you at all . bud permit me -- c.c . baxter -- junior executive , arthur murray graduate , lover .

you got a girl-friend ?

not particularly .

poor mickey -- when i think of him all by himself in that jail in havana -- -- want to see his picture ?

where do we go -- my place or yours ?

no .

because as far as i 'm concerned , he 's a no good fink . two weeks ago i wrote him a letter -- never even answered me .

what about him ?

why not ? we do n't owe buddy-boy anything .

a.w.o.l . ?

no kidding . buddy-boy and kubelik having themselves a little toot !

i do n't know .

tell me again -- what 's my name ?

dreyfuss .

sleeping pills .

always happy to do something for our girls in uniform .

will you excuse me ?

i 'd spell it out for you -- only i ca n't spell .

that little punk -- after all i did for him ! he said i could n't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not miss kubelik . what 's he got against you , anyway ?

he would n't .

baxter ?

atlantic city ?

of course i 'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- i never took those pills -- i never loved you -- we never even met -- is n't that the way you want it ?

a hundred dollars ? i would n't call that cheap . and you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --

yeah -- that 's me . the happy idiot -- a million laughs .

i have that date -- remember ?

i was n't trying .

you 're not being funny .

you did n't really believe me , did you ?

fran -- remember that last weekend we had ?

i do n't believe you .

let 's not start on that again , jeff -- please . i 'm just beginning to get over it .

-- same sauce -- sweet and sour .

like old times . same booth , same song --

no , jeff . i ca n't stay very long . can i have a frozen daiquiri ?

let me take that .

that 's fine . but what are we going to do about grandma and uncle herman and aunt sophie and my two nieces --

bob who ? -- all right , so we 'll watch it at the apartment . big deal . baxter ? it 's okay for thursday .

where does she live ?

i told you -- with my mother .

some setup you got here . a real , honest-to-goodness love nest .

please , sylvia ! it 's a quarter to nine !

propagate -- you know , multiply -- baby flies ?

see if they 'll what ?

i will -- i assure you that -- you got a fifty on that h-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- i 'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --

i do n't know what you 're talking about -- get fucked --

men of all races -- nationalities --

you 're out of your skull --

sit down -- we 'll talk about it .

i said i like all of them .

yeah .

where are you headed ?

what is this ?

moonby , 4th battalion , royal australian regiment , task force . ex-corporal moonby , deserted .

i did n't know we had units up there in north vietnam .

i was an fo for the 25th .

no .

that 's good gin .

my part . beer , with ice and water .

yeah -- typical a.r.v.n .

he was working a.r.v.n . patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole lieutenants -- anyhow , the lieutenant took his new playboy one day , sat on the end of the dock , and would n't give it back .

i do n't get it -- you said your mission was to kill him . let 's do it , an ' get our asses outta here . this kurtz is ruining the war ; i mean , this do n't look good for america !

captain -- they 've been probed all this week -- cong and nva regulars . there 's gon na be a big offense any time .

charlie ?

no shit .

i 've arranged with those people we saw at hau fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --

no , sir -- i 'm a real chef , sir -- i 'm a sauciere --

chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an ' stuff ?

chef .

i hate that -- every time i hear that noise something terrible happens .

arch light .

flood .

can i go get those mangos now ?

signs ?

we found some bodies -- let 's get out a here .

you 'll see soon enough -- get going , sailor --

first air cavalry . they 're the ones gon na get us into the river .

where ?

let 's go .

i met the p.b.r . crew ; they were pretty much all kids , except for phillips , the chief -- gunner 's mate third class l. johnson -- lance johnson ; gunner 's mate third class j. hicks -- the chef -- radio operator second class t. miller ; they called him mr. clean .

too far inland .

anybody see some smoke ?

exactly -- you 'll go up the nung river in a navy p.b.r . -- appear at nu mung ba as if by accident , re-establish your acquintance with colonel kurtz , find out what 's happened -- and why . then terminate his command .

maybe it 's not kurtz . i do n't believe he 's capable of that . i just do n't believe it .

no , it 'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back .

hey , buddy , that boat still runs , eh ?

colonel kurtz , he 's dead .

maybe .

he could n't get through a sentence without all these big words ; about why we kill .

about what ?

this is years ago , before he joined special forces , i guess . we had an argument .

i 've worked with them on occasions and i saw the movie , sir .

you know much about about special forces ; green berets , captain ?

no , sir .

we endure , captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we 'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it . burn the forest and we 'll hide in the swamp . all the while , we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets . au revoir , captain .

do you know that jungle ?

but we civilized it . a place belongs to those who bring light to it , do n't you agree .

a man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me , captain .

we took them from the dead . now -- i assume you want to rest , to shower . we 'll attend to your repairs after dinner .

american weapons ?

fifty calibers , eh , captain --

what ?

i said it 's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet . let 's get a look at it .

lance johnson ? the surfer ?

gunner 's mate , third class -- l. johnson , sir .

you want ' a surf , soldier ?

change .

boss left .

big duke six to baker delta four -- hold -- we 're right over you .

so ? i heard you had a good bunch of killers here .

seems to me he got himself fragged . i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent . maybe a rumor . helluva man -- remarkable officer . walter kurtz woulda been a general some day . general of the army . shit , head of the joint chiefs of staff . did you knew kurtz ?

captain b-l. willard , sir -- 4th recon group -- i carry priority papers from com-sec intelligence 11 corp -- i believe you understand the nature of my mission .

i 'm gon na get you out of here .

the truth that you were sent here to murder me , ans so far you have n't done it . and do you know why ? yes , you know why . your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it . asshole ! schmuck ! how long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they 're doing here . except me .

how 's yours ?

how 's the pain ?

no -- i do n't want to sleep . i want to think . water . give me water .

i love it .

do you know me ?

what do you mean , colonel ?

i 'm kurtz .

his death was -- yes , he died as he lived .

yes , i know ...

what ?

no -- leave it --

no shit ... i think i shot the hell out of him .

what 's this tiger shit ?

i do n't think he 'd of shot us on the beach but -- he 'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --

when ?

you hear it again ?

want to say goodbye to the colonel ?

are you finished surfing ?

maybe he 'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they ca n't see him .

you do n't know how happy that makes me , sir .

captain willard ?

and shut up .

right on -- he 's been waiting for --

but lem me tell you , he is the most dangerous thing in every way that i 've come on so far . he wanted to shoot me . the first thing he said is , ' i 'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter . ' i said i did n't desert from your army , i deserted from my army . he said , ' i 'm going to shoot you just the same . '

so kurtz is alive .

then philippe will have to kill all of you .

what if i say no .

but captain , i mean -- cannibals .

did you know -- deeper in the jungle , upriver -- there are savages ?

do you miss your home , captain ? have you someone there ?

you must realize , captain -- we have lost much here -- i , my husband . gaston -- his wife and son .

no sir , i think -- this 'll be a little bit different --

stepped on a booby trap , sir -- got blown all to hell --

that 's 27 , sir .

134 continued :

inside of three hours you 'd be dragging my dead carcass .

117 continued :

107 continued :

184 continued :

165 continued :

how ? nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season . besides , i 'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics .

43 continued :

had ?

it 's out by the pumping station , shot full of holes .

why ?

sam ? we have n't seen him .

what about that hotheaded marshal , sam wilder ? i heard he was in the middle of this mess .

-- corbett 's a killer .

-- get this straight : i 'm the district supervisor . whatever you do reflects on me . it was n't my idea to bring you people up here , but i 'm stuck with you . you are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes . whichever side you take , you alienate the other . mr. corbett is quite well-known in this region . people admire him --

when you ran off , i thought you 'd keep going 'til you were back home in washington .

nothing broken . c'mon , we have to hurry .

where 's corbett ?

oh , christ , sweetheart . four days ! i thought you were dead , or worse .

prolonged darkness makes people crazy .

do i want to be with you permanently ? yes , i think i do . but be with what you do and the way you live ? that i do n't know . c'mon , eric , until i met you , coming back to alaska was totally

going after killers is n't the same as chasing poachers , eric .

was there any trouble ?

i call it 'the turtle , ' as in carrying your home on your back .

thanks .

what are you doing ?

leave my traps . we 'll tag up , couple days .

okay by me . you 're the one likes these hot springs so much .

how come you did n't let him shoot me ?

can you walk ?

why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside ?

answer and i 'll shoot !

shut up !

lets us watch each other 's backs over a wide area . only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths . elt was in my duffel bag , not around my neck where it should 've been .

hell , i still get a knot in my gut every season , wondering how much longer i can go on . no 'home for retired trappers ' that -more-

i already have .

do n't push me.. !

what do you know about people ? you live like an animal ! a savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here , as far away from the rest of us as possible .

killing wildlife not good enough anymore , so you go on to bigger and better things .

told that 's what our old man was . planned on going to sea , me and bob , 'til i read jack london . started trapping when i was ten . mailed the furs to sears . eight bucks for a skunk , three for a muskrat . that was fine money .

you got one ?

what ? ! fuck off . save yourself .

how many do you see ?

told you i 'm fine !

have to get these wet things off .

folks come to alaska for a real short list of reasons : money . adventure . solitude . those cover most everyone . but frontiers also draw another type of man . one with a demon in his gut . he comes to the edge of the world to face that demon , and lay it to rest .

i 'm here to do my job .

damn lucky this storm did n't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains . it continues , we better stay put .

forget it . it would take days .

have to backtrack , find another way down .

pushing it is flat wrong . all you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail .

most dangerous thing in the world : a regular joe , in over his head . you trying to prove how tough you are for me , or for yourself ?

i 'm right behind you .

ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath .

i do n't plan on dying .

look , take these cuffs off . we need to work together .

you sound like the tourists . know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine . fuck you . you wo n't make it off this mountain .

i needed a pilot 's license to take the job here , so i got one in six weeks .

does he have people ?

ecology . folks use that term for everything but what it means : who 's eating who .

ca n't be much of a crime , if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid .

you got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land .

good idea . flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises . go too low , one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it .

if you have to ask , you would n't understand .

pretty clever : if the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time , sam 's is the first place they 'll look . they may figure you 're waiting for an airplane , so you ca n't stay in the shack by the airstrip . last place they 'd expect you is on the far side of town . i ca n't afford any trouble --

there 'll be three , four men at the most . i have some backup , nothing will happen .

bastards killed sam , you think they wo n't kill the rest of us ?

look , mr. desmond , i did n't count on it turning this ugly .

yeah . sorry i barked at you last night .

just stay out of my face until i 'm gone !

corbett ruined my two-way . go to my place on the haul road , tell anne marie i 'm okay and to sit tight .

if corbett 's men find out --

you do n't mind me saying , mr. desmond , you look like hell .

snowplow , generator , tv dish ... hell , we get the goddamn playboy channel ! here , this is for you .

what does this matter to you ?

alleged killer .

any idea who could 've done it ?

dixie 's waiting at the infirmary . she 'll put a splint on that injured leg .

corbett coming here stinks of trouble . we should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass .

why the smirk ?

look , we pull ben 's ass out of the fire , i 'll get you a whole damn crate of snickers bars .

thought that door was open last night ...

go easy .

meaning he 'll need a plane .

sit your suspect out in the cold . he 'll keep .

everybody wants that , dear -- it does n't exit ... sorry ... did n't mean to interrupt .

well , maybe he has nice friends .

i want us to go out .

leave me be ! why are you doing this ? why are you picking at my sores ... what is it that you want ? ... you want what ? what 's with you ? i hope getting me thinking of everything that 's wrong when all i want is to not do this has some purpose . what is it , mom ? no kidding .

go ahead .

spencer is okay . you 'd better start finding something else to do with your free time . if you ca n't feel good about this break and step out a little ... you ought to get mr. udall to send you over a psychiatrist .

c-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. i got sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let 's go out .

do you love me ?

stay out of this ... doctor ?

not your name ... what are you telling me your name for ! ! where is he ?

mrs. connelly . i 'm martin bettes ... dr. bettes .

i 'm gon na grab you . i did n't mean it to be a question . i 'm gon na grab you .

no ! it 's certainly not . no -- i do n't think so . no .

just let me talk . i 'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you 're the greatest woman on earth . i 'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have ... in how you are with spencer -- spence ... ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that 's all about being straight and good ...

okay .

oh , come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you .

boyfriend ?

it relaxes me ... i 'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else i can think of or imagine .

'cause if you were asleep -- i 'm sorry . and you could be grouchy .

what do you want ?

how you doing ?

let me see ... ahh , gorgeous !

nothing like no choice to make you feel at home .

then i 've really overshot here 'cause i was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out .

i do n't quite get how that 's a compliment for me .

do n't be pessimistic . it 's not your style . okay ... here i goes ... clearly a mistake . i have this -- what ? ailment ... and my doctor -- a shrink ... who i used to see all the time ... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help . i hate pills . very dangerous things , pills . `` hate , '' i am using the word `` hate '' about pills . my compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you 'd never -- well , you were there , you know ... the next morning i started taking these pills .

no ... ... i do n't get this place . they make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress . i do n't get it .

you promised a nice place -- ca n't you just ... you have these dry cleaned all the time , do n't you ?

dancing ?

no answer ... maybe we should just drive there tomorrow . can i have that one ?

anybody here who 's interested in what melvin has to say raise their hands .

i was going to do that for you .

thanks for being on time ... carol , the waitress , this is simon , the fag .

hi .

two days .

now i want you to do something for me .

i also wrote one part ... i wrote i 'm sorry ... i was talking about i was sorry when i got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so i wrote that . i was sorry for busting you on that ... and i 'm sorry for busting in on you that night ... when i said i was never ... i was sorry and i 'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler ...

well , part of what i said in this entire history of my life which you wo n't read is that somehow you 've done more for my mother , my son and me , than anyone else ever has ... and that makes you the most important , surprising , generous person i 've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever .

okay .

yes .

so you 'll be at work ?

to get you back at work so you can wait on me .

that 's not why i 'm here ... ... though you have no idea what it 's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about spencer ...

i was working ... ca n't you just drop me a thank-you note ?

carol the waitress ?

yeah , yeah ... any chance you 'll get back to work today ?

i hear you talk when i 'm waiting ! ! !

what about your mother ?

you know he 's a little dog . next time , if bryan 's not here , you can bring him in .

sorry .

no .

what 's with the plastic picnic ware ? why not try ours ... afraid it is n't clean ?

you 're gon na die soon with that diet , you know that ?

it 's not your table . it 's the place 's table . behave . this once , you can sit at someone else 's station .

i know . he 's just the best .

i 'm starving .

do n't want to . i love you .

i 'll take care of myself --

we held each other . it was better than sex . what i need he gave me great .

i 'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal .

i do n't think so . you need help with the pants ?

can you not be violent ?

was this supposed to be your room ?

what are you trying to do to me ?

yes . no .

two years ago ...

explain to me how you can diagnose someone as `` obsessive compulsive disorder '' and then act like i have any choice in barging in .

yes . your dog is fine , simon .

your neighbor -- udall -- is taking care of him .

jackie , will you hand me the mirror ?

he 's genuinely upsetting , is n't he ?

last word freak .

yes . and tomorrow ? i have a high maintenance selling painter coming through ... so i 'm out . can you take him ?

okay by me .

no . he wants him back . he 'll be by tomorrow .

simon , you 've got to get dressed .

wait here .

actually , i do n't think so .

hi . you have hard shells , right ?

frank loves you . you know that ... but i 've spoken to him and he feels that -- -- as a businessman , with limited resources ...

well , i ca n't reach them .

terrify me ?

no ! would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him ?

is he dead yet ?

what ?

you know who you want . i 'll take your seat any day . so do something ... do n't sleep on it ... go over there . i do n't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it 's not always good to let things calm down .

look , we both want the dog -- and ...

look , i 've got to get a hold of frank and see where i 'm hanging my hat 'cause ...

another place where ?

good-bye . well , your luck is holding . they sublet your place . you 're homeless . frank 's got a line on another place you can use for now .

... now he 's going to want to stay . and they 'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever . so it 's a good five hours back . it gives us a chance to take it easy and ...

i get why you 're angry . it 's no snap to explain why i was like that , but let 's not try to do it on the run ...

not it at all , really .

but sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain .

i have n't been sleeping . i have n't been clear or felt like myself . i 'm in trouble . some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back ... but the tiredness -- boy ... not just sleepy .

got any easier questions ?

would you leave now , please ?

now we 'll both call him .

get out .

please , just leave .

go away .

if you 'll excuse me i 'm not feeling so well .

maybe i 'll bring him some food by .

thank you . verdell ... sweetheart ? by the way , thanks for saving me .

i found verdell , mr. udall .

i got it . you 're talking about your dog . i thought that was the name of the colored man i 've been seeing in the hall .

mr. udall ... excuse me . hey there ! have you seen verdell ?

that somebody out there knows what it 's like to be ... in here .

wait -- i want to see the painting .

bain !

game over , bitch !

you do n't know a fucking thing about me . you do n't have the slightest fucking clue .

listen to me , bain . two days ago , you contacted your contractor , who told you that they knew when and where i was going to pick up the transferred money from microcell . you do n't know how they got the information . it bothered you , but you did n't care . how do i know this ? because ten years ago , i was sitting in that chair , as scared shitless as you are now .

bullshit .

after those cops , you 'll never be able to come back to cleveland .

tachlinkov .

we both know what you were doing .

sounds like chickenshit --

hey . what i do n't get was why did n't you take the shot inside the restaurant ? i mean you had me , a free shot . that 's what i would have done .

the hell i ca n't . it 's my cab . i do n't like you . so , get the hell out !

yeah .

yeah , it 's terrible . i mean valli , and i do n't care what office he 's running for , the guy 's a crook . he probably had it coming , but all the other people . real sad .

what is this ?

so you 're from around here ?

what ?

is there a problem ?

what ?

they money will be standard bank transfer . we believe we will know where and when .

i 'm on the scent .

a new player . he 's using the name nicholai .

the contract was stolen .

send the file . i 'll have the estimate tonight .

sick . the flu .

$ 1,000,000 .

i give a fuck ? i 'm done ! i quit ! do you fucking hear me ! i 'm fucking gone !

i bet you fucking know !

i know what happened .

i have been sitting on a contract from cleveland for six days because of you .

yes .

last night --

why ?

maybe you should see a psychiatrist .

uh-huh .

who was she ?

it happened to you before ?

why ? i do n't know .

did he explain how this happened ?

i know . it makes me crazy .

no ?

she is married , but not to him . another man , much older . she has four kids . the young guy works for her . and i think she likes kinky sex .

nobody ever sees me .

i did n't notice them .

so ?

no .

do you have ulcers ?

except , if he does n't come out of the hotel .

i 've been thinking about it for a long time .

five million apiece . you get on your plane , i get on mine .

you 'll have the money . how do i know that you wo n't --

then , we wait .

the beach ? it was nice .

i 'm kind of tired . i think i 'd like to try and get some sleep .

it helps me to focus . it centers me , helps me think .

what ?

good .

no . something honest .

that 's fiction .

did it ever bother you ?

yes .

they are very good at what they do . it 's very seductive . the training , the weapons , the travel --

of course . i was going to be james bond .

they did n't give you a choice , did they ?

why not ?

some people said that . i never thought so .

you were like a boy genius ?

they recruited me when i was in high school .

more or less .

the c.i.a . ?

i killed him .

why did n't you finish this game ?

better than playing with yourself .

with computers .

because i 'm done .

as in daughter of agamemnon ?

how ?

if it had n't been for me , you would be dead .

and you want to use me to get him ?

because he is trying to retire me .

so this is something between you and him ?

someone hired both of you ?

another contractor .

what does that mean ?

you 're one of them , are n't you ?

yellow pages . v for veterinarian . there are n't that many .

what do you mean , 'that 's all ' ? what in the hell do you know ?

you 're one of them , are n't you ? a fucking pro .

yeah .

yeah ?

took a guess . lucky for you , i guessed right .

um , five .

what ?

a pleasure doing business with you .

jesus ! why did n't you tell me ?

god damnit , electra . this is not a game . this is business .

i thought it was interesting --

do you ever think about starting over ?

i think you 're supposed to answer that question .

i prefer it like this .

yes . please come in .

when i thought about this , that was always there , in the back of my head , that image of me on my knees , crying . it would n't go away and it would really upset me . it was something that i could never get away from ... but now , i feel it 's okay . i feel good .

what do other guys do ?

that 's exactly what i told myself .

a dime .

it 's a common question .

funny , i 've never been a talker . my wife was always getting on me about that . 'say what you feel , tell me what 's bothering you , you ve got to talk to me . ' i never would though . not really .

thank you .

excellent , senor . if you could follow me ?

like you ?

i do n't know . it 's kind of underground . doug 's right , there 's too much crap in this town .

a coke , if they have it ?

and pay for their drinks occasionally .

what about me ?

if i cut a deal , i 'm not staying in this country and i want holly to come with me . so , if she does n't come here today , you 're going to have to get her to me tomorrow ; after i call , promise ?

suppose those contained all the file info too ? you could have a third or so of it there .

i could try and get a western lawyer .

i do n't know , i 'm waiting for the transcript .

did you see a lawyer and go before a judge ?

damn !

honza says they 'll print an open letter to president havel in next weeks edition even if they have to threaten a walk-out .

tell me some bad news ?

it 's me you want , i 'm responsible for all this .

what ?

it just happened .

could n't keep your hands off the hired help , huh ?

no , the boyfriend .

and a tram hit you ?

i fell in love .

no , we are n't going to do it .

you 're all bloody useless .

forget it doug , it 's no good .

you get the wine and i 'll go see if i can rustle up some plastic cups .

not on the opening night , would n't look right .

you should have said it was bring-a-bottle .

well , i think i_ve got a handle on the czech pysche and i reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties . plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for kafka .

who put a bee up your butt ?

we do n't speak czech !

so why did n't we ?

let 's split .

stealing 's stealing , we might as well get what we need . this 'll do for the floor and the walkway too .

just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better .

destroy the evidence huh .

i thought you were gon na throw these ?

yeah , i 'll take some .

and suppose a little old lady lives there ?

it must be fair old size , suppose it 's empty ?

i 'd love to get in there .

no , it 's welded up ! ... .let 's take a look from the inside .

i do n't know but that used to be a window and i think that was a door .

just save me a little patch and i 'll do it later .

tough break .

yeah , that was honza 's idea , i had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear .

'cause you stink of booze .

no , why ?

thought of everything have n't you .

tell them we 're working for the university .

i 'm making history chris , nothings going to stop me . there could be a knighthood for us in this , once president havel hears .

i 'll drill the locks and replace the barrels , that way it wo n't cost so much .

later mate , right now i 've got to do the locks on these doors so we do n't have to climb through that bloody window every time .

do n't worry , i 'll give you a hand as soon as i can .

no , i got nothing till tuesday .

alright i give in . but let 's not end up in jail . okay ?

chris , what if i were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing , all it needs is a good clean out and the power on , then we 're in business .

well , it 's like i said , there 's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city , so they 're not private ... . now , jahn here is an drama student at the university . he knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it , until they ran out of money .

okay , we 're listening . but i 'm with katka on this one .

these guys think the west is just mtv and hollywood movies . we 've got to show them there 's more to it .

so ? doug well , there 's tons of empty buildings - why do n't we get one ?

an alternative literary venue !

this place is getting expensive too , used to be twelve .

what did the beer cost ?

hmm..smells good . cheers !

just because they 've got a choice of four mcdonalds , does n't mean they can afford a cheeseburger .

you 're outnumbered kat two to one , got to go with the majority , that 's democracy .

well , this place is too expensive so you 've had it .

inspirations a fickle thing , you do n't realise you had it till it 's gone .

how to make a buck !

that one ?

sure i 'm sure !

you 're sure ?

before you go , did you get those bruises here ?

now , have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges ?

your home address is 18 thornton avenue , coventry .

we should be done by the weekend .

hey , lawrence how are you doing mate ?

forget about me kat .

there 's nothing there for me .

but we could go to london and live in england .

i 'm no good for you katka , besides i wo n't be able to stay in prague .

if you get out can we be together again .

no , i love you , really .

right now , yeah - you 're talking crap .

i 'm not a bloody teenager okay , i told you i ca n't do that shit .

i could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but i waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs .

yeah , you 're right ... . i 've got an idea !

nonsense , we can pick up the tram on the other side , it wo n't take any longer . come on !

it 's not fair , you hardly talked to me tonight .

okay , whatever . come on chris !

i do n't want to get in trouble .

you 're everything a guy could want .

so what 's it going to be , coogan 's or u vayvudoo ?

how about you brutus ?

ooh , well excuse me .

i think he 's jealous of havel .

cool ... .so , if we say eight o'clock .

about forty minutes .

okay .

it 's not so much .

later . jahn , i 've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring . they brought the materials but took my money and ran . you guys have a school theatre do n't you ?

sure , i 've done it easily .

do n't worry , i 've got lots of friends .

tomorrow , we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric . i think it will be finished in the morning .

yeah , great ... .dobchay ! it will dry , yes ?

okay ?

what for ?

there 's three thousand and if you do n't come through , i 'm going throw you clean out of that window . deal ?

two hundred dollars , make it six thousand crowns ?

i got a bad feeling about this ... . how much do you need ?

i 'm in close with these guys , it is n't easy , but slowly they 're opening up to me . give me a month and i 'll blow their movement wide open .

how ?

will they free me ?

any chance of getting me out on bail ?

how did he look ?

uh-huh !

what would you like , beer ?

a champion of lost causes huh ?

i moving more to communism now it 's dying out .

the way i look at it , i 've carried the camel to water and stuffed it 's head under - if it does n't drink now , we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day .

alright , go help chris shovel up the last of the crap .

well she sure is n't normal .

would you like your things now ?

i 'm not sure it 's possible .

first , i want to walk free with a letter , in english , from the prosecutor general dropping all charges . second , i want two first class tickets to london leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope . lastly , all actions against the students are to be stopped !

thanks , but i do n't intend to stay .

enjoying our hospitality ?

either you 're a liar or you are a fool .

it was the biggest i could find .

fuck you !

you do n't have fifty foot of apartment !

honey what a pleasant surprise , sorry to keep you waiting .

you bastard !

that 's my bag .

i think we should be going honey .

and what of these foreigners ?

so , who is in the building ?

yes , i think so , it is still barred , but it is not the university who are in the building .

the files are in a sealed room and the university are under strict orders to stay away .

i 'll tell her you were here .

landon . you have two parents . we 're both here for you even --

be yourself and i do n't think there is a wrong thing . let jamie take the lead . she 'll let you know what she needs .

it was the only thing i 've ever asked him !

i told him to leave me alone .

to see your father ?

thanks .

there 's hot cider in the kitchen .

you going to let him ? you going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to ?

out with belinda ?

it could help with a new car --

i do n't want his money .

about a job .

who are you ?

how 're you doing ?

that 's what i mean .

i 've talked to your father .

now ? we just --

what are you thinking ?

nope .

that what you do ?

i do n't care .

what 's the best thing i can see tonight ?

ergo ?

mars .

that . and less strange .

you 're sometimes not sure ?

that what 's happening to you , only faster ?

i have to get you home by one .

is there a rush ?

i 'm not allowed to date .

why are you doing all this ? to impress me ?

it 's not .

all of it .

people can see .

healthy as can be .

that 's it ! exactly ! you 're reading my mind --

you do n't miss a thing .

your father does n't like me .

you have to believe to have faith .

i know there 's a plan for everyone , but sometimes i do n't understand what the message is -- or what the point is .

or building blocks for a world that never formed .

saturn . beautiful .

what is that ?

spend a year in the peace corps . make a medical discovery --

so what else is on this list ?

you got some kind of list ?

the reason i got the part ... i 'm a little like lizzie . except i do n't worry about some man rescuing me .

kinda . yeah .

what 's with the friggin numbers ?

what the -- ? !

then we both know . i 'll point . you drive . faster .

this play -- ?

' i hope your dreams come true . '

like what ? the moons of jupiter ?

you mean care what you say ? i 'm worrying about other things .

-- this your idea of small talk ?

i was wrong . nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did . not even god .

this -- him -- landon -- is what 's best for me !

dad --

i 'm asking how much .

getting by .

you know about this stuff ?

i 'm not tired .

landon . we 've lived with this for over a year now and --

i 'd like to take jamie to dinner on new year 's eve .

you 're in the play ?

i did n't say you did .

finally , i 'd like you to join the drama club . rehearsals are tuesday and thursday evenings .

i 'm as underprivileged as they are --

that 's right . the world is your oyster .

now i can do what i want .

that 's right . you just act like one .

scalene ?

no ... .

i do n't get it . how come there 's no rock ' n roll ?

this ... is the number one single ?

dick , what 's with those guys out there in the gutter ?

gim me some chili , fries , and a tab .

but he does ! do n't you see ?

yeah . maybe so .

have we ever met before ?

uh , thanks ...

i do n't think i like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl !

i 've been calling you for five minutes ! did n't you hear me ?

oh -- i 'm all right . say , listen , about this dance saturday night --

oh . uh ... 'hey , you ! get your damn hands off her ! ' george paused . you really think i should swear ?

okay . so right around 9:00 she 's gon na get very angry with me -

i 'm going to be at the dance .

lem me see that .

huh ?

well ... yeah ...

learn anything ?

marty . marty lewis .

hey , mr. arky , gim me a break ! i 'm seventeen years old ! i 'm not responsible for all these problems !

unfortunately , the way things are going , you may get your wish . you may see the entire annhiliation of the world . if not , you 'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources . we can already see the air we breathe , not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes . we 'll see all of our oil reserves depleted , in fact , all of our energy sources . yes , you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see .

mr. mcfly here wants to nuke it all , just so he can see it !

you 'd like to see a nuclear holocaust ?

march 11th .

i 'm sorry , there 's no answer .

oh -- right ! uh , madison 3489 .

what ?

operator ...

pro ! release the rope !

according to your girlfriend , suzy parker , you and she were at the movies . you went to the restroom and you never came out . obviously , you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp , created by the original operation of the time machine .

you see , i never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. i decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky . anyway , experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of cuba caught dr. felstien fooling around in the bermuda triangle -- that was back in '64 .

1982 ! march 18 , just like we planned ! my calculations were absolutely correct ! thirty years ! god , i can not believe it 's been thirty years ! sure , it was a long time ago -- longest i 've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment !

professor brown grinned . i guess i 'll see you in ... about 30 years .

curious ... very curious .

look , marty , she 's not your mother yet . and if you do n't go through with this , she may never be . i know it 's hard , but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant . some choices must be made that are difficult . nonetheless , we must make them . besides , this may be more than a simple question of your own existence , he added . the fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . marty tried to smile at him .

believe me , professor , running around on a nuclear test site ca n't be any more dangerous than what i 've been doing .

where did you get this ?

look , it 's not a big deal ! i can fix it ! all i got ta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out !

oh -- that -- i found it in the closet .

say , where did this guitar come from ?

you 're talking crazy ! an atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds !

i do n't know , but i do n't want to take any chances ! now you stay here and do n't do anything . do n't answer the door , do n't answer the phone , do n't go outside . understand ?

hey , look , gim me a break ! all i did was answer the door ! how 's that gon na change history ?

then i would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history ! do n't you understand ? the fabric of history is very delicate . anything you do could have serious consequences !

you were ringing the doorbell !

the power converter ...

so what ? we 'd be rich !

a gold mine ?

why ?

no , marty . shemp 's molecular structure is completely intact !

jeez , for a guy with a ton of clocks , you sure do n't pay much attention to time .

oh , right , right ...

oh -- marty -- what time did you say it was ?

what ?

what did you do to yours ?

suzy !

hell no ! the way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest . you shoulda seen her face when i told her we were gon na stay up all night saturday , he added . always afraid something is going to happen .

can you imagine your parents in bed together ?

no self confidence , i guess ... at least you do n't take after him .

... he just lets himself get pushed around all the time ! people walk all over him and he never fights back , never stands up for himself .

you expect me to believe that ?

well , he 's gone .

kind of round , like so ... gold . i 'll show you if you want .

would n't be here if i had n't .

you lost that one ?

sure thing . come on .

for coming onto my property ... with a gun .

listen . i got a lot of respect for her , sir . that 's about as good a one as i know to tell you .

well , i 've felt that way , had n't you ?

i 've got to stick by kit ... he feels trapped .

i just do n't want to go .

he 's not coming to take us for a ride , either . come on , let 's make a run for the car .

well . i 'm not going to let that stop me .

nothing ... i was just running off at the mouth ... as usual .

what ?

never mind . it does n't matter ... if i 'm worth a damn , i 'll pick the right direction . and if i 'm not , well , i do n't care . see what i mean ?

how about over here ?

well , maybe the slope here is throwing it off some . we ought to find a more flat place .

well , maybe we oughta be stuck here . i 'm not saying that i know .

it was going too fast .

maybe we should 've tried to hop it .

everybody loves trout .

well , i 'll catch you a big trout . soon as we get to the mountains .

i do n't blame him .

soon as i start the car ... and fix my hat .

no .

do n't .

well , why you always walking behind me ?

well , we 'll see about that ... hey , lookie .

i do n't want a steak .

what 'd you put him in there for ?

yeah , me too .

i 'm fine . kind of tired .

would n't be funny ... listen , i 'll be back in a while .

i came in the front .

well , that 's the point , stupid .

but it would hurt .

do n't ask me .

somebody else is going to get it .

okay .

you 're a redhead .

something mi trabajo .

how do you say `` quit my job '' in spanish ?

spanish .

quit my job .

now what 's he know about garbage , huh ?

he 'll say that ?

what ?

well , nobody asked me what i thought . they just hung it on me .

oh , incidentally , my last name is carruthers . sounds a little too much like `` druthers '' , does n't it ?

what for ?

holly .

hi , i 'm kit . i 'm not keeping you from anything important , am i ?

sure .

what 's that ?

okay , no monkey business then .

you 're my friend , are n't you ?

good a way to kill time as any ... she okay ?

yes .

git .

who are you ?

see , we 're about out ... been driving all night . actually , i do n't even have time to explain it to you .

i could 've held off an army if i could 've gotten behind a rock in the mountains .

you mean the guy from the old wine commercials ?

you wan na take the chance , casper ?

nothing to apologize for , casper . you 've gone beyond the call of duty tonight . mind if i get on the horn and radio the cavaliers -- ? they 'll be worried .

which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part , right , professor ?

i 'm assigning a couple blue shields to protect you around the clock , just in case .

just 'grazed ' you , huh ?

yoyodyne propulsion systems ? you think they 're mixed up in this ?

first thing i did .

got a half a tuna sandwich .

whorfin ? does he know we 're coming ?

where 's the professor ?

dead . damnit !

yeah , but most of 'em blasted in through the eighth dimension in 1938 at grover 's mills , new jersey ...

planet 10 ? the same planet 10 you postulated beyond pluto , perfect tommy ? the invisible body ?

hey , any lock can be picked . so what 's he up to ?

everybody ready ? how do we look ? do we look okay ?

we 're going down ! onto the runway !

just their side . what 're we gon na do with these people ? they 're illegal aliens , the way i figure , been here forty years , you could throw the book at 'em ...

john parker , tell them we 're doing our best . stall .

they 're armed for bear , buckaroo . check out those radiation levels .

absolutely .

yeah ... and maybe more important , if you believe in yourself .

i wish he was . he 's real enough .

you do n't wan na know .

how did she die ? i wan na know .

oh , my .

i 'll shoot yours off if i had a gun , you double-dealing casanova ! i thought you liked me for myself . but why should you , huh ? a jerk like me .

any time .

what ? i do n't understand you . i do n't understand anything anymore .

i do n't know . i always felt like i did , like there was another me ...

wyoming ? not cody , by any chance ?

it 's kinda hard this way .

who ?

pretty terrible shot .

what 're you doing here ? why 're you looking at me like that ?

do i look like that kinda girl ? i lost my room this morning . i do n't know where i 'm gon na sleep tonight , but i keep going . what the hell else can i do ? i 've still got my figure , and like this bozo said , as long as there 's a sidewalk , i 'll always have a job .

my name is penny . penny priddy . there i 've said it , but it wo n't mean anything to you . i 'm a nobody .

somebody get her a mike ? can we manage that ? and a spotlight . what 's your name ?

raise your hand ... where ?

not too terrific , sir . i apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space , and it looks like the earth 's caught in a crossfire .

world watch one . direct incoming transmission .

i have a radio fix ...

should we be on code red ?

still no confirmation either from sac or strategic space command . they report all surveillance satellite communication jammed .

what 's his problem ?

nigh on ten years . been through a lotta scrapes together .

how long you been riding with buckaroo , reno ?

no ! ditto the professor-

you 're thinking of mr. wizard . this guy 's an eccentric genius .

flying to cambodia .

i want to know how many of bill 's books you wrote !

well , the basic ideas were frequently his-

what are they like ? what are they about ?

if i can . he gets jealous ; he-

... who is this ?

audrey , listen , i need help . i know it 's late and i should n't be calling you like this believe me i would n't have if i could see any other alternative , but i i 'm sorry - listen , how are you i 'm sorry . you doing okay ?

okay , but that does n't excuse his

he 'll wander back when he 's sober and apologize . he always does .

what ? ! he 's a son of a bitch !

perhaps you and i could get together at some point also . i 'm sorry if that sounds abrupt . i just ... i do n't know anyone here in this town .

i 'll be fine ... are you a writer , mr fink ?

not anything , bill . do n't test me .

well , m'olfactory 's turnin ' womanish on me lyin ' and deceitful ...

that 's hamburger grease , bill .

yeah , he 's funny that way .

ever talk to him ?

no , i i did n't mean to sound

i 'm buildin ' a levee . gulp by gulp , brick by brick . raisin ' up a levee to keep that ragin ' river of manure from lappin ' at m'door .

... no , i 've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain . maybe it 's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one 's fellow man to help somehow to ease his suffering . maybe it 's a personal pain . at any rate , i do n't believe good work is possible without it .

it 's still a little early for me .

w.p . mayhew ? the writer ?

souse ! souse ! he manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week !

a souse !

i 'm afraid i do n't really understand that genre . maybe that 's the prob-

getting started ! christ jesus ! started ? ! you mean you do n't have anything ? !

wallace beery . wrestling picture . what do you need , a road map ?

what ! ? ted okum does n't know shit . they 've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year . what ted okum does n't know you could almost squeeze into the hollywood bowl .

think about it , fink . writers come and go ; we always need indians .

i 'm a writer , mr. geisler . ted okum said i should drop by morning to see you about the

well , you just ... sound a little

sound a little what ?

i 'm fine , garland , but i have to talk with you .

okay .

barton ? what time is it ? are you all right ?

to do what ?

we have to talk a little business . i 've just been on the phone to los angeles . barton , capitol pictures wants to put you under contract . they 've offered you a thousand dollars a week . i think i can get them to go as high as two .

i thought you were going to join us . jesus , garland , you left me alone with those people .

because you do n't listen !

you got ta get a grip on , brother . you got ta just carry on just for a few days , till i get back . try and stay here , keep your door locked . do n't talk to anyone . we just got ta keep our heads and we 'll figure it out .

it 's okay ... it 's okay ...

we got ta call the police

i do n't know ! i woke up , she was ... god , you got ta believe me !

hold on . stop . take a deep breath . tell me what happened .

... jesus , barton , what the hell is this ? what 're we gon na do ?

get a grip on yourself , brother . whatever the problem is , we 'll sort it out .

no ... can i come in ?

well it 's pathetic , is n't it ? i mean to a guy from new york .

what a dump ...

i 'm truly sorry to hear that , charlie . i 'll miss you .

those two love-birds next door drivin ' you nuts ?

a little lift , yeah ...

hi , charlie .

ready ... wrestle !

... all right now , when i say `` ready ... wrestle ! '' you try and pin me , and i try and pin you . that 's the whole game . got it ?

not a bit of it , compadre ! easiest thing in the world ! you just get down on your knees to my left , slap your right hand here ...

that 's all right , really

... you 're a little out of your weight class , but just for purposes of demonstration

... probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who 's writing a wrestling picture for wallace beery .

... this must be boring you .

you know , in a way , i envy you charlie . your daily routine you know what 's expected . you know the drill . my job is to plumb the depths , so to speak , dredge something up from inside , something honest . there 's no road map for that territory ...

i myself have yet to be lassoed .

sure , sure charlie , you can help by just being yourself .

you 're all right , charlie . i 'm glad you stopped by . i 'm sorry if well i know i sometimes run on .

frequently played , seldom remarked .

yeah , i guess that 's tragedy right there .

exactly , charlie ! you understand what i 'm saying a lot more than some of these literary types . because you 're a real man !

hell , i could tell you some stories

... i do n't guess this means much to you .

hell yes . because i believe in it . fire , theft , and casualty are not things that only happen to other people that 's what i tell 'em . writing does n't work out , you might want to look into it . providing for basic human need a fella could do worse .

damned difficult , i 'd imagine .

fink .

lou .

... where did we put him ?

no kidding , bright boy we smelt mundt all over this . was he the idea man ?

is this multiple choice ?

uh-huh .

... fred ...

he teach you to do it ?

second one of your friends to end up dead .

ya know , fink , ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful . but i 'll be frank with you : that is not helpful .

he 's a little funny in the head .

yeah , and i 'm buck rogers .

look at `` blood , sweat , and canvas '' . these are big movies , fink . about big men , in tights both physically and mentally . but especially physically . we do n't put wallace beery in some fruity movie about suffering i thought we were together on that .

yes , colonel .

excellent picture .

mr. fink has n't given a preference , mr. lipnik .

yeah , i was drinking .

were you drinking ?

yeah .

all night ?

home . watching tv .

where were you tonight ?

bring 1976 up .

it 's not gon na take long , sam .

you know i 'm whacko , sam , what 'd you find ?

you 're on leave , man . you 're on psycho leave . i 'm talking to a possible whacko here .

we got a call from berkeley p.d . there was a killing . a professor . icepick . in his bed . multiple stab wounds . 1977 .

do n't ! i know about your husband . you still like girls , beth ?

what are you doing here ?

i slept with her once in school . i was just a kid . i was experimenting . it was just that one time . she developed a ... fixation ... on me . she styled her hair like mine . she wore the same kind of clothes i did . it scared me .

she told you , did n't she ?

i do n't need any help .

what is your problem ? i 'm trying to help you . why wo n't you let me help you ?

what was she like in school ?

it 's the least i could do ... considering i got you into this mess with those reports .

yeah ? well why do n't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out . but take my advice . put a little more life into it than you usually do .

nilsen .

thank you .

no ! i 'm working my tail off . i 'm off the sauce , i 'm not even smoking anymore .

no .

how is your -- personal life ?

things are fine . i told you . they 're fine .

we fuck like minks . we raise rugrats . we live happily ever after .

what do we do now , nick ?

somebody always does .

somebody has to die .

it wo n't sell .

i 'm very good at research . i 'll help you .

i did , too . she told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did .

i just thought i 'd surprise you . what 's the matter ?

why ?

you wo n't believe me .

no ?

no .

make love to me .

everybody that i care about dies .

did you like her to watch ?

i should have known . i came into the house when you were down on the beach . she looked at me so strangely . she left right after you . i should n't have let her watch us . she wanted to watch me all the time . she tried to kill you , did n't she ?

fine . how 's your back ?

how about roxy ? is she a fuck to the century , too ?

i thought it was a pretty good beginning .

how 's your new book ?

good . i 'd miss you . you can get into trouble , though . you 're not really a cop anymore .

you 're not going to stop following me around now just because you 're on leave -- are you ?

to see if he can get away with it .

are n't you going to thank me ?

i know , nicky , but i like it .

what if i asked you not to call me shooter ?

jack daniel 's okay ? it 's gon na have to be .

do n't get too cocky .

i like you .

i do n't know about that i do n't have any money i do n't have any attorneys gus is my only real friend .

no .

yes . she 's helped me understand homicidal impulse .

no . come in .

am i ... disturbing you ?

you see ? we 're both innocent , nick .

why not ?

writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him .

no . i said i liked johnny to use his hands . i do n't give any rules , nick . i go with the flow .

i have nothing to hide .

a detective . he falls for the wrong woman .

only when they make interesting reading .

yes .

yes .

how long were you dating him ?

i know who you are .

i 'm de ...

did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him ?

do you use drugs , ms. tramell ?

you make it up , but it has to be believable . they call it suspension of disbelief .

it teaches you to lie .

it must really be somehtin ' -- makin ' stuff up all the time .

why would i need an attorney ?

really . maybe that 's why you 're from homicide . how ?

that 's him .

routine .

were there ever any suspects ?

she said alone -- suite 405. it ai n't gon na take long .

i 'm going with you .

where the hell you goin ' ?

do n't you get it , gus ? if beth killed johnny boz to frame catherine -- she would n't want anyone to know what happened at berkeley . it gives her the motive to kill nilsen .

which one you talkin ' about now , son ? we know ole hazel did it ; we know young roxy did it -- and the other one well , hell , she 's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain .

you 're my friend , gus .

you all right , pop ? you want me to drive you ?

i 'm not afraid of her .

what in the hell for ? you think i 'm gettin ' any at my age ? i do n't like blue-haired women . i do n't like 'em .

easy there , partner -- i was n't there .

she want to play ? fine . i can play .

somethin ' , though .

she knows where i live and breathe . she 's coming after me .

you sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that .

how 'd it go , son ?

ai n't that cute ? they got his and her pig-assos , son .

they 're executives . they 're nervous about everything .

not now he do n't .

you look like dogshit .

yeah . i know .

not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch .

you 're looking for catherine , not me .

what do you want ?

yeah . but you did n't tell me to stay away from her car .

i do n't think she meant to go off the hill , do you ?

tell me again . i want to hear you say it again .

first you 've got her buying your file . now you 've got her killing nilsen . forget her , willya ? go someplace . sit in the sun . get away from this goddamn fog . get her out of your system .

beth ? now you 've got beth killing people ?

gus -- go over to berkeley . harrigan -- find out what else she 's published . andrews -- get the files on her parents ' accident . carbon beth on everything . i want some psychological input on this andrews and harrigan go ; nick is left there with gus .

her parents died in an accident . i do n't care what else she 's written . what are you -- a book critic ?

i 'm sure .

formerly engaged to roberto vasquez , deceased --

maybe that 's what you 're counting on to get you off the hook .

on what basis ?

he died -- about five or six years ago .

anderson . jack w. donald m. i 'm sorry . no lisa .

why do you think he 's dead ?

as long as i 've known andy , he 's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs . he 's painted my picture , we 've eaten dinner in god knows how many places together . but he does n't care about me . he cares about you . you 're the only person he cares about . he 's your friend . fuck that article . you want a toasted bagel with cream cheese ?

no , i wanted to make a painting of you .

you 're right . it 's your version . you should come over to the studio sometime .

i like the one with the dragon 's heads a lot . but the black one 's filled up with too many heads ... i 'd take some of them out . i think you 're painting too fast . i would n't put in so many heads . let it breathe a bit .

not sure . how was yours ?

when 's your show ?

i do n't know .

is this finished yet ?

rene 's been telling me about your work .

i do n't even have any friends anymore besides you . and everyone says `` warhol ? that death-warmed over person on drugs ? he 's just using you . ''

do you still love her ?

ouch..

that 's good . at least they 're interested .

i wish they 'd quit writing this shit about me .

andy , man , thanks for coming . i 'd like to paint your jacket .

you do n't even work on your stuff !

i can give you five . you did n't do very much to these .

ohhh . that 's new . that sounds good .

well , i do n't want to get mugged on a bowery street corner . maybe i could find a place for you to work . take my card .

you name it , i paint there .

you have n't been by lately .

mothafuckah !

i can get ten .

you have a bunch of them , do n't you ? albert milo walks in from another room .

is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution ?

yes , yes ... let 's talk about that ... . your roots ... your father is from haiti , is n't he ?

not black .

what ?

i use a lot of colors not only black .

decipher ?

... can you ... decipher this for us ?

what is it that gets you out of bed in the morning ?

yeah .

wan na bet ? if you show too much respect for people with money , they do n't have respect for you .

still not here .

it 's andy again .

sit down ! you 're gon na fall out !

come on , let 's get out of here .

i do n't really have any problems .

good .

i ai n't john henry .

for real ?

willie mays ! ! ! willie mays ! ! !

hi gina .

do n't give him anything , man . your art 's worth a lot . trade . that 's what real artists do with each other . besides , he 'll just use you . he 's famous for that .

he 's the best painter in the world . i 'm gon na give him one of these .

oh man ! folklore guy worked on the railroad . y'know , pounding in spikes and laying down track . then one day they invented a machine to do it . and he says `` fuck that , i 'm a man '' and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track . it takes two days . neck and neck the whole time . they get right to the end , and he beats it by one spike . got a cigarette ?

famous people are usually pretty stupid . you 're too smart . you 'd get bored to death . you do n't wan na be like john henry fighting the machine . just do what you do . it 's about integrity . follow your heart .

about what ?

you 're shattering all my myths .

concentrate on the ball . shoot .

i am ... on gina . fuck i did n't think we were actually gon na do this .

come on , jean . get rid of your cigarette . concentrate .

we 're getting married . she said she could tell i was a great artist she could see it in my eyes . she said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me .

the devil , man . rene ricard . art critic writes for artforum . people read him . tell him who you are..

hey willie mays .

that is amazing . what year is it ?

do n't you think he 's using you ?

a present i picked up for you .

you mean babies with you ?

... babies .

staten island would be ok .

i 'm going to my parents this weekend . what am i going to wear ? how could you do that to me ?

basquiat , those are my best clothes ! ! ! what are you doing ?

wan na go get some breakfast ?

just come to the mudd club on friday .

i 'm clean . smell me . i always smell good . i do n't know why , i just do !

can i walk you home ?

it 's three thousand dollars !

nice to meet you , shenge . want a job ?

what 's your name , man ?

would you check out my studio some time ?

me ? why ?

i 've seen you before . i like your paintings a lot . your hair was different .

hi .

how can i ever thank you ?

thanks again for not inviting me . i 'm only here on business .

hey , rene .

forget it .

that one 's for you .

5:11 .

my point exactly .

fuck band practice ... if you 're gon na be a painter you 're gon na have to break a few hearts you do n't wan na be like tony bennett..

uh huhh ... band practice ? it 's benny . he wants to know why you 're not at band practice ... ?

jean ? hold this , please . you 'll get there . but it 's good to have something to fall back on . that 's why i became an electrician . it pays the rent . y'know , i 'm an artist , too .

you do n't have any ! ! !

jean , could you get me a phillips screwdriver ?

yo ! jean , this is ramellzee .

you 'll never guess .

seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead , or deeply resentful .

i tried to grab you -- save you --

but a kiss can be even deadlier , if you mean it .

maybe you 're right .

things change .

better than you know , bat-boy .

i do n't know . till we figure it out , let 's ... let 's keep dancing .

but a kiss can be even deadlier , if you mean ... it .

there 's a big , comfy california king over in bedding . what say we ...

ah ... then you 've come to the right lonely mansion .

nope , i told her everything .

had one . did n't work .

`` we '' ? you and ...

well , i 'm ... braver at night , if that 's what you mean ...

i heard on tv , `` catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds . '' how do these hacks < u > sleep < /u > at night ?

the news these days ... weird . people looking to superheroes for their peace of mind , and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves , or their spouses at least .

scare me ? no , actually , i was just scaring myself ...

i , ah ... did n't catch your last name .

pouring myself into my work .

have we ?

ingenious costume . let me guess ... trust-fund goody-goody ?

yes , did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope ? is that why you cut short your vacation and came back ?

wayne , i 'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office . if my assistant were here , she 'd already have escorted you out , to --

scared of oswald , are you ? why , if his parents had n't eighty- sixed him you two might 've been roomies , at prep school !

if my life has had any meaning , that 's the meaning .

no . no glass on the inside .

he < u > is < /u > batman , you moron .

selina ! selina kyle ! ? you 're fired ! and bruce -- bruce wayne ! why are you dressed up as batman ?

i do n't know what you want , but i know i can get it for you with a minimum of fuss . money , jewels , a very big ball of string ...

me , domesticated ? by you ? i doubt it ! you repulsive ... awful ... < u > penguin < /u > .

he 'd have more power as a martyr . no , to destroy batman we must first turn him into what he hates most . meaning , us .

huh ? you 're implying i 'm some kinda psycho criminal ?

pms .

yes . < u > yes < /u > . boyfriend trouble .. ?

she jumped . she 'd been depressed .

dad ! save yourself !

the christmas eve of destruction -- !

i think you 'd feel out of place at my party . you see , it 's for winners .

imagine : you 'll have the ear of the media . access to captains of industry . unlimited poon- tang ...

reclaim my birthright , y'mean ?

bu ... wh ... i ... i mean ...

do n't look , oswald . it 's a surprise .

you wo n't regret this , mr. shreck .

yawn . that coulda come from anywhere .

i damn well better be . in fact i want you to phone those goniffs over at gotham insurance and tell them --

and a very , very good one .

and who ... would you say this < u > to < /u > ?

working late ? i 'm touched .

i came to give you your freedom , a chance to live the life you choose . the same gift you gave me .

i 'm sorry . i was too late .

as i 've missed you . sleep well , child .

it 's good to see you again , uncle . i 've missed you .

you certainly will not .

how long has it been , uncle alfred ?

that , sir , does not compute .

right here , sir .

alfred , old friend , i could use your help right now .

have you ever regretted your life working here , alfred ?

you are going back to school .

hey , i 'm the one who kicked ivy 's botanical butt . personally . me . i did .

their new computer sciences division . how did you know ?

oxbridge academy ?

alfred 's happy here .

you 'd be surprised .

al 's main squeeze . is she here ? i 'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue , right ?

damn ? damn is not good .

be ready for anything .

this is easy .

after you have frozen , your icy tomb will plummet back to gotham .

winded , old timer ?

maybe he melted .

remember the victim at the airport . toxins introduced through the mouth .

just the beast .

no . her case is too advanced . but maybe , someday , with more research-

umm-hmmmm .

me too . great stems , though .

i 'm totally over her . positively .

she 's definitely part of this . it 's weird , for a while ivy was all i could think about . but then ...

i can make it .

pull back . you ca n't make the jump .

i 'll borrow it from you . four million - -

he 'll be here .

how about , nice to see you ? glad you 're here to save my life .

... a giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...

this is all about fashion for you , is n't it ?

i ca n't . but perhaps tonight , over dinner ... i 've just had an opening .

physical perfection , charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster . how do you explain your behavior ?

tell me , billionaire , would you warm faster to my pleas if i looked more like ms. january here ?

your intentions are noble , but no diesel fuel for heat . no coolants to preserve food . millions would die of cold and hunger alone .

forget the stars . look here , at the earth , our mother , our womb . she deserves our loyalty and protection . and yet you spoil her lands , poison her oceans , blacken her skies . you 're killing her .

i have here a proposal showing how wayne enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment .

we cut our support . a conflict of ideologies . dr. woodrue was a lunatic .

actually , i already work for you . or did . your arboreal preservation project in south america .

dr. pamela isley .

but there 's nothing you 've done under the cover of darkness i could n't learn to understand .

julie , i 'm not the marrying kind . there are things about me you would n't understand .

what ? i 'm sorry . you were saying ...

but soon ...

you 'd say anything to keep me away from her . to keep her for yourself .

and she did it all for me . for love .

she 's clouded your mind . you 're not thinking straight .

like hell you do .

talk to him , bruce . there 's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel .

i 'm fine . see . me . here . alive . how are we gon na work together if you 're never going to trust me ?

dick , you were reckless . you could have been killed .

absolutely . just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator .

not good .

i 'm hungry . i think i 'll have poultry .

inspired , ms. ivy .

one kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face . their secret identities would be revealed . but how best to bait a brid ?

i have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals . once you have frozen mankind , my mutants will overrun the globe . the earth will become a brave new world of only plants . and we shall rule them . for we will be the only two people left in the world .

kill them . of course . but why stop there ? why should only batman and robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished ?

their bones will turn to ice . their blood will freeze in my hands .

where is my wife ?

in my weakened state i am no match for the bat and the bird .

i wonder if i can get a cell with a view of the gardens ?

let 's cool it for now . there 's someone i want you to meet .

well , i , my most unabominable snowman , have been impressed by you . in fact i propose a pairing . so i 'm here to set you free .

impressive

listen , captain cold , the suit , maybe , even though silver went out in the 70 's . but those boots are unforgivable . what is it with men ?

okay , my hair is brittle , my skin is dry and i do n't care . i 'd weather blizzards to have you . you 're the most perfect man i 've ever known .

tell me and i 'll kiss you .

of trust . tell me your plan .

how about dangerous curves ?

at you ? polly want a kiss ?

well , i can respect your opinion .

our work ?

... our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications . he cut the funding for our work -

what do we have here ? a lovely new supply of venom . i 'll just take this to my laboratory for further study .

what now sir ?

exactly . mr. e. mister edward nygma .

perhaps . perhaps not . why not ask the lady ?

why , indeed ?

which ` they ' might that be , sir ?

actually , he took the car .

he ran away ?

is he all right ?

sorry to bother you , sir . i have some rather distressing news about master dick .

take any three you like . after you get settled we can ...

i remember the bat , though . his scream . those eyes . i was sure the fear would kill me . in time i came to believe that if i became a monster , that if i was feared , i would n't be scared anymore . i was wrong . they think i became batman to fight crime . i became batman to fight the fear . and instead i became the fear .

i do n't know , sir . your dear parents . suddenly gone . so much loss ...

apology hastily retracted .

scholarly research ?

it 's a wonder you sleep at all .

master wayne 's dead wives .

welcome , master grayson . i 'm alfred .

maybe you just have n't met the right woman ...

i 'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic .

try a fireman . less to take off .

last night at the circus . i noticed something about dent . his coin . he 's obsessed with justice . it 's his achilles ' heel . it can be exploited .

he 's home . i sent the signal .

_two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _second_ bank of gotham on the _22nd_ how could harvey ? _two_-face resist ?

excellent . see . who says a guy in a rubber suit ca n't be smart ? well , it 's been grand . sorry you all have to die now .

no more tricks , edward . release chase and dick . this is between you and me .

rinka .

nostrovia .

what ? oh , it 's very impressive .

what ? oh , edward . hi . congratulations . great party-

so glad you could come .

precisely . what 's on all our minds ? brainwaves . the future of wayne enterprises is brainwaves !

oh god , bruce , you were a child . you were n't responsible .

rage . anger . passion . pain .

throw up that ridiculous superficial mask . if you 're jealous ...

what do you want me to say ? that i 'm not attracted to him ?

i 'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home .

why do i feel like the other man , here ?

find anything interesting ?

and now ... .

fast work . you just moved here .

that kid is amazing .

what ? this is n't normal ?

i 'm sorry . who are you ?

and into a black dress .

the letter writer is obsessed with you . his only escape may be ...

so , this riddler , he 's dangerous ?

what i do is n't about revenge .

i figure telling that cop i 'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will . so no offense but thanks . see ya .

ca n't tell if you do n't say please .

who is the batman , edward ?

yesssssss . i know !

dr. burton tells me you know who batman is .

... fired ... your fired ... your fired . you understand ? ! fired ! !

yo . charlie . gimmie an order of brain deep-fry . extra well done . hold the neurons . patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload . notation : obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject . riddle me this , fred . what is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else ? your mind of course . and now mine pumps with the power of yours . new from brain-bok . da pump . think faster . reason higher . out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life . da pump . yeah . ho ! mark . i sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic . the acrostic . the crypto-graphic . what doth this bode ? answer me marcutio , you little runt . fred , i must confess you were a wonderful appetizer . simply divine . but now i yearn for a meal of substance . the main course . a wide and varied palette . ah , to taste the mind of a hero . a nobleman . a poet . a chick in a short skirt would n't be so bad either .

fred ?

uh , yeah . thanks , mr..uh ... face .

a hit .

a-14 .

go ahead . you can say it .

a man with a death wish .

how 'd you find us ?

mr. wayne is out for the day .

alexander knox . gotham globe .

which bathroom is that , sir ?

if not for you i never would 've made it . you know that . my own parents could n't have ... ... the boy , alfred . you 'll both be provided for . do n't let all this got to waste .

i know the feeling . it wo n't last . he 's a long way ahead of where i was at his age .

... very good , sir .

gosh , i could kill you , but then you 'd miss my party . and you , batman -- you 're the guest of honor !

take me . let the boy go .

is this what you wanted ?

if you do n't mind my asking ... who 's close to you ?

i do n't want to jeopardize anyone close to me .

no . every product contains one component . the elements react in combination . hair spray wo n't do it . but hair spray and perfume and lipstick will . untraceable . it 's very elegant .

that ca n't be right . that would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned . we 'd all be dead .

what is that ?

exploring . in the woods . many years ago . -- i was a solitary child .

how 'd you find this place ?

it does n't protect your head , though .

what is this stuff ? kevlar ?

i wo n't let you have it .

i 'll have to ask you for that film .

too many people . come on ! shields ! !

which car ?

i assume in my usual charming manner i 've just insulted the host . alexander knox .

ohhhh ... you do n't mean that .

in all these years ... why could n't i see how it wold turn out ?

i 'm sorry , she hung up . what are --

bruce , at the rate you 're going , you ca n't even save yourself .

you 're one man . you ca n't save everybody .

no one would miss me .

vicki ? ... this is batman . i thought i 'd call and see how you 're doing .

i 'm sorry i had to stand you up today . i 'd like to make it up to you .

i do n't sing very well .

i see . if i know how you really feel , i wo n't like you as much .

that 's a tough one . have you ever seen combat ?

then for god 's sake , harvey , cancel the anniversary celebration .

i suggest a nice big bomb .

somebody 's killed the --

i 'm on top of it . if there 's a problem --

sorry . we had another bat sighting .

i dunno , man . after what happened to johnny gobs - -

i understand .

very good idea , jack . in fact -- -- i 'd like you to handle this operation personally .

that 's it .

that 's it ?

please ! we 'll talk . just tell us what you expect .

... why the mask ?

and you want a --

unfortunate , but i think we can work around it .

holy shit . holy ...

jesus , vicki ! where is it ? ?

not what ?

alexander ... i know you .

... okay , then , i have a confession to make . i 'm the batman .

allie , i know exactly why you 're doing this .

what were you thinking ?

well , you know me . the more they 've got , the less they 're worth . this guy must be the most worthless man in america .

oh , absolutely . bruce and i are very close .

evildoers , huh ? big or small ?

too much glamor , huh . what 's in the bag - - monte carlo ? apes in kenya ?

here , let me do that .

sorry , honey - he just happened to tag along .

0 my god .

great . you said you 'd ask grierson about putting our guest somewhere else . did you ?

yes . and i have a wine for dinner that will kill you .

0h ali we can work this thing out , you know .

one .

did you really ask ?

well , they 're kind of busy but it does n't look like ...

do we know anything about him ?

sounds great . excellent . though- , ahm ... there 's this guy who 's coming to work at the gallery , from england ...

do n't ask him about work , charlie . life 's too short .

thanks , annie .

what happened ? ! ! !

what ? what ?

yes . ahm . i was just wondering where my english house guest had got to .

yes , look , i wanted to talk to you about this . i 'm sure we have n't been doing as badly as all that .

thank you bernie . well done . now , if you 'll excuse - i have a little smartening up to do myself .

and that 's where you introduce me to the governor .

david ?

so ... i 'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel .

lord walton assures me this guy 's one of the very top scholars in the english art world . has a couple of doctorates no less .

i beg your pardon ?

a car sounds sensible .

very accommodating well , no , sir , i 'm sure ...

thank you david . however , flattery will get you nowhere . truth is , i have a rather different plan for whistler 's dear mama . bernie and i have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is , we can not survive with our current losses , so ...

yes , this is doctor bean .

ah ... jennifer , i need you to watch kevin . jen ?

sure . you 're right .

honey , calm down now ... it 's okay ...

no - but when you 've torn out a man 's throat with your bare hands , you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life .

you arrange those flowers yourself ?

well , michael bolton 's pretty grisly .

okay ... ..

we need you urgently in c theatre .

i 've known soldiers who 've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two . not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you did n't even know it 'd been stolen ! i 'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson 's school than anything from you guys .

why thank you sir .

hi , grierson , forgive the war paint . going on to my regiment/s reunion after .

of course he is .

you know the thing i hate most about children ?

so do i , jane . i 'm on vacation .

adam my booyy ! when you 're really rich in what matters ... ... nothing matters ! my buyer has just made a killing in condos in the village . and he 's got a little stress problem ... ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet !

we 're rich in what really matters .

you 'll be rich !

no , jane .

oh , adam , do n't tease her . you never got an a in science in your life !

just a hunch .

you know , i 've been thinking . i could teach lydia to sew .

he might have hurt somebody .

who did the sushi ?

i do n't care , i 've changed my mind . ... i feel < u > really < /u > confident . we 're getting better at this stuff . we can scare them off ourselves -- tonight ! i 've got an idea . you 're going to love it ... i 'm going to hate it .

but < u > we < /u > let him out .

i am not going to expose that little girl to that ... pervert down there .

i guess we open it .

has anything been simple so far ? from the look of the shovel , we dig .

bet ... el ... geuse . what an awful name . i thought it was like -- you know . the < u > juice < /u > of < u > beetles < /u > .

three times . powerful number .

what happened ?

< u > betelgeuse < /u > !

here 's something .

then it should be here .

god , this is so corny . have we been reduced to this ? sheets ?

no . but it 's somewhere without big worms .

i do n't know ... what are you looking up ?

that 's it ? no number , or instructions ?

oh , adam , do n't ever leave me alone .

i do n't know if there 's anything we can do .

at least we wo n't have to worry about her .

she ca n't see you , right ? in the book , rule number two : the living usually wo n't see the dead .

there are a thousand things ... why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch ? is this a punishment ? are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell ? and how long is this going to < u > last < /u > ?

this book is n't arranged that way . what do you want to know ?

anything happen while i was away ?

how 's your arm ?

oh ... i 'm sorry ...

slow down there , honey ... i do n't want the vibration to weaken the model .

yeah it turned out okay . we applied for a national historical plaque for it . that 'll be the third one on main street .

wave at the lion .

we should be flattered that she wants to sell our house .

god ... manchurian tung oil ? there 's enough to refinish the gateleg table < u > and < /u > the cherry wardrobe !

i got an a !

why are you creeping around delia 's bedroom ?

nobody else can .

is this like a trick question ?

i 'm not scared of ralph lauren . those are < u > sheets < /u > . are you gross under there ? are you < u > night of the < /u > < u > living dead < /u > under there ? like all bloody veins and pus ?

we 're ghosts .

< u > barbara < /u > ? ! !

well , we did n't know --

we tried .

hell is other people . you obviously do n't read much . besides things seem pretty quiet here . you should thank god you did n't die in italy . the deetzes . okay . have you been studying the manual ?

no . what 's wrong ?

bio- < u > busting < /u > . i < u > loves < /u > bio-busting . who do i got ta kill ? family -- right ? obnoxious i bet . mommie , daddy , piglets .

all right . who are you ?

about what ?

yeah . he still tries popping up all over the place . but he ca n't join the party unless you call on him . get the deetzes out by yourselves ! i got ta go .

if ... we have trouble . what about the guy in the flyer ? betelge ...

-- like you used to be ?

he said if i let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you .

funeral . god , you guys < u > really are < /u > < u > dead < /u > ! what was it like ? the funeral . did you cry ?

we ca n't . we have n't left the house since the funeral .

oh , honey ... i did n't mean anything ... it 's just too big for you two . i know these things .

barbara maitland , sweetie , you just listen now . this house is too big . it really ought to be for a couple with a family .

no ! jane , it is 6:45 in the morning !

honey -- today i am three hundred < u > fifty < /u > thousand dollars !

that 's right , jane . complete vacation .



they 'd look silly on me . i 'm fourteen years old !

no i do n't . i do n't take orders from smurfs .

you 've < u > got < /u > to say it !

your name is < u > beetle juice < /u > ? yecch ! that 's as bad as < u > deee < /u > lia < u > deee < /u > tz .

that 's it !

i am < u > not < /u > ! beetle ... juice ?

i ... i do n't know what your name is .

where 'd they go ?

it 's too late , charles . i 'm sorry .

otho ?

that 's fine , otho . just keep me out of it . i am here to relax and clip coupons . and goddamnit , i mean to do it .

i think she 's in with them .

just do n't tell lydia .

we 're going to have a lot to do tomorrow ... the goodwill truck is coming , and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it . should have it fumigated too . i saw a fly today .

listen , you guys . these ghosts are really nice people . i think we scared them off . let 's just leave them alone . okay ?

yes . except when you creep around in your mother 's --

dad . do you believe me ?

well i just wanted to tell you what i saw .

i 'm lonely .

what ?

where is your mother ?

yeah , maybe if he 's nice , he 'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn .

my whole life is a darkroom ! one ... big ... dark ... room .

what do you think , honey ?

yeah yeah , we 'll think on it . 'bye ya , charles . you relax up there , ya hear ?

no listen ... we 'll talk about this visiting later , i got ta go , i got ta meeting on the japanese joint venture .

then we own a whole < u > town < /u > full of nowhere .

it does n't matter . what matters is i 've got a roomful of guests down there , who think i 'm a fraud . i am going to teach you something here lydia . you 've < u > got < /u > to take the right tone in things like this , or people -- whether they 're dead or alive -- people will walk all < u > over < /u > you . come on out , or i will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never < u > lived < /u > !

shhhh . they did n't commit suicide .

of < u > course < /u > we were n't scared . just a little startled . one of those sushi dropped down my kamali .

i think the reason is they were trying to scare you , and you did n't get scared --

lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon .

i saw some ghosts .

i < u > told < /u > them you were too mean to be afraid .

< u > you jerks < /u > ! that is my art , and it is < u > dangerous < /u > ! you think i want to die like that ? lydia . moving is a family affair . so buckle down now and go get mommy some drugs .

what 's happening to them ?

oh , they 're still here . they 're just not showing up .

we 're dealing with tracy and hepburn here , a very sophisticated pair . we must protect them , treat them with respect , < u > nur < /u > ture them .

you do n't have a key ?

is there much more of this torture ?

be brave ! otho take care ! onward !

of course , her favorite color ! how < u > beautiful < /u > !

gooood !

no time like the present , as my wicked stepmother used to say .

are we going to be seeing you at miss shannon 's boarding school ?

< u > adam < /u > ! < u > adam < /u > !

all presences have a home space . a place where they live , so to speak . where do they hide out ?

yes , robert . i have seen it before . it happens to old people .

he does , does he ?

there 's no need for a claim , the garden is a healthy one .

claim ... ? ... oh , claim , that 's what thomas asked me .

now , you 'll barely feel this . it wo n't hurt at all .

it 's not good , ben - i 'm sure you can feel it .

to everyone , i 'm afraid . the government controls are so restricting that the medical profession , as we know it , is being legislated out of existence .

i think we 'd better go look for him . david !

at times , yes . but that 's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident . actually , i found him to have quite a sense of humor .

not necessary , but preferable . i do n't think he 'll be a bother , he seems like a most refreshing sort of man .

i wanted some fresh air , robert . how is mr. gardiner ?

good god , eve - you 'll freeze out here .

certainly , glad to be of help .

i see . mr. franklin , i must ask you and miss hayes to keep this incident with mr. gardiner to yourselves . there 's no telling what he was involved in , and the matter may be extremely confidential . so please , not a word .

well , he said it was his , he walked us through it .

gardiner is not a foreign agent , there are now sixteen countries investigating the man . we can rule that out .

fine . they felt that since you had such close ties with the president , you would be a splendid choice . ... can i help you ? are you looking for something ?

yes , i have seen that show on television .

mr. gardiner , i have a telephone call for you . sidney courtney , the financial editor of the washington post .

chauncey ! chauncey !

i like to watch .

... come in , chauncey - please come in ...

it must be the punch , and it is stuffy in here -- i feel it a little myself . you 're an angel , my dear - thank god there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort .

yes . that could be true .

yes , eve . i 'm very glad that you did n't open .

... you know , chauncey ... i want us to be ... i want us ... you and i to become ... close ... i want us to become very close , you know ... ?

no , eve . i do n't read the papers .

good night , eve .

... good night , chauncey .

... you do n't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase , do you ?

that 's good . i like to watch , too .

he 's tired , chauncey - but he 's going to watch you tonight . we 'll both be watching .

hello , eve .

chauncey ...

yes , so do we .

yes . i was .

yes .

good . i 'm glad to hear that . ... how did you like meeting the president ?

... why ... no , i do n't think so ...

i am a very good gardener .

wo n't your injury prevent you from attending to business , mr. gardiner ?

i like to watch . this is fine .

did you lose something ?

would you care for a drink ?

... why , yes , he is ... is your leg feeling any better ?

... wo n't you let us do something for you ? your leg should be examined , we could take you to a hospital .

yes , that is correct . i think you should ask mr. rand that .

of course . but since he is ill i 'm taking the liberty of asking you .

i think you should ask mr. rand that .

good , sir . and so , it seems , did the president - but we would like to have some facts ; such as , uh ... what exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the first american financial corporation ?

hello , sid .

i see .

hello , morton .

i see .

... are you sure you like it ?

so you know your krylov in russian , do you ? mr. gardiner , i must confess i had suspected as much all along - i know an educated man when i meet one !

we are not far ... ... our chairs almost touch .

ben is very ill .

regretfully , mrs. rand - i shall yield the pleasure of your company to others .

i agree .

you must sit with us , my friend , we have much to discuss .

let me feel the strength in your hand , chauncey ... let me feel your strength ... yes , that 's good ... i hope , chauncey - i hope that you 'll stay with eve ... take care of her , watch over her , she 's a delicate flower , chauncey ...

good . together , the two of you should create quite a stir - i can already hear the gossip .

thank you , ben .

oh , sure you do , the financial assistance program . i think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking . i 'd like you to meet with the members of the board , we 'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time .

i think what my most insightful friend is saying , mr. president , is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature , yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy .

i see , ben .

hah ! it 's all make-up , chauncey ... i asked nurse teresa to fix me up , i did n't want the president to think i was going to die during our talk .

... oh ? robert , take a look , would you ?

i could give it some thought , ben , but my leg is very sore .

now , wait a minute , chauncey you are young , you are healthy , for god 's sake do n't give up on yourself ! you have to fight ! you ca n't let those bastards keep you down ! i do n't want to hear any more from you about the 'room upstairs ' . that 's where i 'm going soon .

yes . shut down and locked by the attorneys .

i feel very good in here .

... i see .

we could do it now , we can go upstairs . ... please , it 's time for us . come upstairs .

i ca n't read .

mr. gardiner , my editors and i have been wondering if you 'd consider writing a book for us ? something on your political philosophy . what do you say ?

yes , i would like to see ben .

... did you wish to see someone , sir ?

yes .

yes . of men and women .

what about money ?

your appearance does n't suggest that at all , mr. chance .

... then you really are a gardener ?

very good .

... yes . you can take me .

let 's have a look , do you mind ?

this is terrible , sir - i hope you 're not badly injured ...

yes . it seems to be .

... that is a very small room .

yes , i 'm very hungry .

i 'm afraid he 's slippin ' a bit with every hour that goes by ...

... evening , chance .

do n't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons ? the bad as well as the good ?

which view ?

yes ... of course , you know , mr. gardiner , that i always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests , i hope you do n't object to that .

but you wo n't sign , correct ?

come now , mr. chance .

no , thomas . i do n't know how to sign .

mr. chance , assuming what you say is the truth , i would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased 's estate .

you have me , i am here . what more proof do you need ?

mr. chance , that was twenty-seven years ago .

then how about medical records ? could you give us the name of your doctor , or your dentist ?

no , i do not have any of those .

yes , thomas . i have always been here . i have always worked in the garden .

hello , thomas ... i 'm chance , the gardener .

yes . i will .

yes . it has .

... spring and summer ... yes , i see ... fall and winter . yes , indeed ... could you go through that one more time , please , mr. gardiner ?

that is correct . in a garden , growth has its season . there is spring and summer , but there is also fall and winter . and then spring and summer again ...

yes , i will .

sure , try again - where ? there 's nothing , it 's like he never existed !

... yes , i am , ben .

i 'm becoming quite attached to chauncey - quite attached ... ... and so are you , are n't you , eve .

no headaches ?

thank you , greta . i 'll be with mr. rand if i 'm needed .

good evening , wilson .

sophie , this is chauncey gardiner ...

oh , no , sweetheart - it 's not you ...

gladly ... ... the safe is in mr. jennings ' bedroom , that 'll be stop number one .

... business , bullshit ! going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar ...

very good , your excellency .

there is no information available on the man before he moved into benjamin rand 's . it has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the united states government .

what do you mean there is nothing ? that 's impossible .

good . anything else ?

oh ? what ?

yes , sir .

well , we do have data from honeycutt 's sources , chief - but it is n't pertinent .

we ... uh , have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at mr. rand 's home ... and , uh ...

no , sir .

i do not want benjamin rand disturbed ! you have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man . use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of chauncey gardiner , if you run into problems , alert honeycutt . i 'll be in the office at seven in the morning and i would like to have it at that time . i 've got to take a leak .

he 's an advisor and close personal friend of rand 's ! for christ sakes , they have volumes of data on benjamin !

yes , sir - we are aware of all that , but still , we have n't been able to ...

and put it through on a code red - i want it as soon as possible .

thank you , colonel .

that could be possible ...

mr. gardiner ...

it 's that serious , huh ?

well , ben ... i ...

mr. gardiner , my pleasure .

... mr. president , how good to see you .

this is my fiancee maxine .

john ! great to see you ! sorry about the cunt at reception .

yeah , okay .

oh , i will , and i have many , many friends and associates , my friend . all , by the way , in overeaters anonymous . all of them fat and alone like me , all of them dream of being someone else , all of them with john malkovich as their second choice !

tell your friends .

you came up here looking for the portal ?

i 'm sorry for everything .

the monkey .

i 'm so glad you 're safe . you look really wonderful .

i love you so much .

you 're not a monster , craig . just a confused man .

i 'm sorry . oh god , i 'm sorry . i 'm some kind of monster . i 'm the guy you read about in the paper and go , `` he 's some kind of monster . ''

i need a shower .

perhaps you 're right . i ca n't let you go though . too much has happened . you 're my ace in the hole .

things change . anyway , you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in maxine .

suck my dick !

sometimes we 're forced to make hard decisions . i 'd like for us to stay together , craig . you know , platonically , if that 's possible . i truly value our friendship .

life is confusing , is n't it ?

do n't forget me .

and he was with her .

did you know that eskimos have not one , but fifty words for snow . it 's because they have so much of it .

i have to go back tonight . at eight exactly .

fuck pets . is this your partner ? i had to come back and do the malkovich ride again . fuck everything else . is this her ?

i have to go back .

hi .

i ... puppeteer .

i 'm a puppeteer .

yeah . okay .

the great mantini does n't need a day job .

this portal is mine and must be sealed up forever . for the love of god .

i know . i 'm sorry ...

that ... was ... no ... simulation .

let me try !

you ? why i 'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience .

let me try .

sure , after a fashion .

simulates ?

holy shit ! he said what i said !

holy shit , yes !

maxine ...

music to my ears ! whatever you said . speak , speak , speak , my magnificent friend , speak !

you 're not like the other boys we 've had here . granted , i ca n't understand what you 're saying either , but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis .

yex ?

forget it .

i 'm sorry , i 'm afraid i have no idea what you 're saying right now .

schwartz .

i am not alone . there are others . we are legion . you will pay for this blasphemy . you will pay dearly .

you 're insane .

and what sort of business will this be ? if you do n't mind my asking .

thank you , sir .

dr. lester . . .

wife , huh ? i 'd love to meet her , craig .

imagine a room full of women . nubile , blonde , wet with desire , schwartz . a harem , if you will . me in leather . a harness , if you like . i am the object of this desire , and all eyes are on me as i speak . ladies , i begin . i am the love god , eros . i intoxicate you . my spunk is to you manna from heaven ...

no sir-e-bob , i do n't die . but what i do is get older , wrinkled like a former plum that 's become the wrinkled prune you see before you . oh , to be a young man again , maybe then floris would care for me .

low overhead , m'boy . we pass the savings on to you . but seriously , that 's all covered in orientation .

glooph is not a letter , sir .

you think so , eh ? which comes first , l or ... glooph ?

not at all , dr. lester . i simply misspoke .

actually , my name is craig schwartz , dr. lester .

of course , right this way , mr. malkovich . compliments of the house .

yes , yes , sweetheart , yes !

a girl has a right to glow if she wants . it 's in the fucking constitution .

do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes ? no i do n't suppose you would . it 's quite a thrill , craig .

my god .

i 'll protect you , dollface .

really ? but , maxine , can of worms ! end of the world ! illusory nature of existence !

fine . i 'll do it myself . i was going to offer a partnership to you , but this way it 's more money for me .

but there 's something profound here , maxine , we ca n't exploit it .

is this malkovich fellow appealing ?

what 's he been in ?

sounds delightful . who the fuck is john malkovich ?

you 're a fag or a liar .

dont let the girly shit fool you . it 'd blow your shorts off .

no , no , it 's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or ...

yeah . but enough about me .

maxine .

that 's incredible ! nobody told me ! i swear ! it 's kismet . maxine ! it 's a beautiful name . there 's a psychic connection . do n't you see ? it was meant to be ! maxine ! maxine ! maxine ! i will shout it from the rooftops !

well , don , i peeked in here , even though i know it 's against floor policy . and i discovered that there 's a little tiny door in here . is n't it cute ? it 's almost like a little dolly 's door . i wonder what its for .

ha ha ha !

don , i was wondering , do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings ?

i 'll be with you always , my friends . who knows , maybe if i 'm lucky , i 'll rejoin you with wings and a beak .

must you take this terrible demon on yourself , my love ?

well that 's perfect . my second choice . ah , this is wonderful . too good to be true ! you see , i 'm a sad man . sad and fat and alone . oh , i 've tried all the diets , my friends . lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise . did it work ? you be the judge . but malkovich ! king of new york ! man about town ! most eligible bachelor ! bon vivant ! the schopenhauer of the 20th century ! thin man extraordinaire !

no . do n't be an ass .

fine . your mail 's on the kitchen table . mostly junk . oh , there 's a letter from alex trebek .

i am the devil , lester . i think i can handle it .

what kind of circumstances ?

no , for god 's sake , i just watered it yesterday . it almost went well . i gave a pretty good dream , but circumstances arose .

impressions ? those are hard .

yes , my dear ?

forget it .

do you ?

all the better . hey , hot lesbian witches , next geraldo , buddy boy . ha ha ha .

you were stoned . case closed . end of story . how hot is this babe ?

yeah yeah yeah . yadda yadda yadda . were you stoned ?

kevin , i 'm telling you ... it was like nothing i 've ...

anybody else ?

it 's craig in there , i can tell .

no , you do n't understand . i 've been inside malkovich when i 'm with maxine ...

but now we 've lost access to craig .

you followed your heart , my child , and that is not necessarily a bad thing .

we need you on the inside , my child . to report on his comings and goings , and if need be , to ... destroy him ... ... for lack of a better word .

but why , son of malkovich ?

with immense pleasure , my dear . down that hall , ninth door on the left . watch the step down . it 's sunken , you know .

but maxine , i thought it was me you loved .

one hour .

we have to meet .

ah .

let her go , craig . i mean him . ''

do n't stand in the way of my actualization as a man , craig .

great then .

say ... `` equus '' ? it 's got everything .

because if you missed any , i just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now .

good-bye , maxine .

derek mantini !

honey , we can be happy and poor together .

it 's okay , my sweet .

you mean with malkovich ?

you still there , sweets ?

i 'll say you are . let 's do it on his kitchen table , then make him eat an omelette off of it .

i 'm getting better all the time .

apparently you can control this malkovich fellow now .

lotte called me .

do n't con me , maxine . we 're over . i just let you up here to tell you that , and to tell you that i 'm taking you and schwartz to court .

darling !

oh , lotte ...

no , i guess not . i 'm an actor .

can i get you a drink ?

captain mertin , surely i am a god-fearing christian woman like yourself , but alas , i am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind . door knobs are too high , chairs are unwieldy , high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature . nor am i a marrie lady , captain . after all , who would marry a person of my diminutiveness ? so i am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist . why can not there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable ?

i see . well , it is not my fault that thou art tiny . so if it is charity yer after , then be gone with ye , ye foul demon .

know it , and go on out the yard . go on .

you getting into bed to think about yellow ?

what i have to do is get in my bed and lay down . i want to fix on something harmless in this world .

say the word !

if i call them , and they come what on earth am i going to say to them .

this saturday - you coming to call or what ?

here , let me carry that .

oh , i remember bits and pieces of all of'em i guess..halle , of course..i had halle a lifetime . almost twenty years ... my two girls , sold and gone before i could even a heard about it , and them without their grown up teeth yet . my third child , my son after halle ... i let that straw boss have me for four months so 's i could keep that boy . next year , he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child . i could n't love that child . i would n't . not any of the rest either . god take what he would ... .and he did ...

you best leave that quilt alone . that was grandma 's quilt .

the whitefolk ?

and she is mine ...

you 're were n't nice to me..you did n't smile at me..

you gave me the bad dreams . you left me behind ...

can they get in here ?

you grown .

i do n't . i have my own .

at times . at other times i think she was ... more . but who would know that better than you . i mean , you sure 'nough you her .

you think i should stop by ? think she 'd welcome it ?

more than all right . miss bodwin , she teach me stuff..book stuff . she says i might go to oberlin . she 's experimenting on me .

they treating you right over at the bodwins ?

they good whitefolks ?

i miss her .

i never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me . always . never be another like her .

you know what ? i 've been here since i was fourteen and i remember like yesterday when baby suggs , holy , came here and sat right where you are . whiteman name of garner brought her . he and mr. bodwin were good friends . that 's how she got that house you all live in . other things too .

yes ma'am..

i want to see mr. and mrs. bodwin .

i want to work , miss lady .

mama ?

no ... no ... no..

but you 'll hurt your eyes doin it there . come sit at the table .

she likes this dress ...

no ! ... she wanted me to do it .

mama let me help you .

hold back denver - i 'm fine..you..you go on upstairs . i 'll do the cleaning up .

daddy is coming for us .

should i wake her ?

you know as well as i do , stamp , that people who die bad do n't stay in the ground .

till she showed herself .

you know she married baby suggs ' boy .

well , who can tell what went on in there ? i never even knew who sethe was or none of her people .

you know he 's colored ? what else there to know ?

it 's cold as charity in there ! what he do that for ? any number 'll take him in .

yeah . asked rev . pike if he could stay in the cellar .

out where ?

all he can . all he can .

she was only-

jesus .

i was there paul d ... there in the yard . when she did it .

no use thinking these things now .

just me .

well i ... i did get offered one place but i just wanted to be off by myself a spell .

for what ?

what , baby ?

i 'm tired , paul . so tired . i have to rest a while .

she comes in the daytime . she still with me , my denver .

devil 's confusion . what 's this i hear about you not getting out of bed ? i saw denver . she tell you ?

sethe ?

not too sweet ! you make it too sweet they do n't eat it .

what the hell you thinking , girl ? strolling in here this late ?

yes sir..you right about that . that 's just what i come over to talk to him about . just that..

look here..there 's a cross up there , so i guess this here 's a church or used to be . seems to me like you ought to show it some respect , you follow me ?

plank road . yes sir . that 's up a ways . mile , maybe .

dude , uh , tomorrow is already the tenth .

he looks like a fuckin ' loser .

what do you think ?

yeah ?

where 'd she been ?

well , okay , you 're not privy to all the new shit , so uh , you know , but that 's what you pay me for . speaking of which , would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash ? i got ta check this with my accountant of course , but my concern is that , you know , it could bump me into a higher tax --

this is our concern , dude .

he suspects that the culprits might be the very people who , uh , soiled your rug , and you 're in a unique position to confirm or , uh , disconfirm that suspicion .

uh-huh .

what are you , some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties ?

the ? who the fff --

the gundersons .

who 're you working for ? lebowski ? jackie treehorn ?

hey hey , i 'm not messing with your special lady --

a dick , man ! and let me tell you something : i dig your work . playing one side against the other -- in bed with everybody -- fabulous stuff , man .

come and get it . fucking nihilist .

that is our most modestly priced receptacle .

what 's this ?

thank you , donny .

your phone 's ringing , dude .

sheesh .

i am the walrus .

yeah , this is the guy , this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug . i mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug .

shut the fuck up , donny . not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin ' to find reverse on a soviet tank . this is not a worthy --

am i wrong ?

are you gon na split hairs ?

oh for christ -- will you shut the fuck up , donny .

really , dude , you surprise me . they 're not gon na kill shit . they 're not gon na do shit . what can they do ? fuckin ' amateurs . and meanwhile , look at the bottom line . who 's sitting on a million fucking dollars ? am i wrong ?

walter , if you ca n't ride in a car , how d'you get around on shammas --

went alright . dude 's car got a little dinged up --

they posted the next round of the tournament --

life does not stop and start at your convenience , you miserable piece of shit .

huh ?

what --

what tied the room together , dude ?

-- smoking thai-stick , breaking into the rotc --

one -- oh ! heh-heh . you never went to college ?

i see .

no , they --

are these .

and in fact he met privately with the president , though unfortunately there was n't time for a photo opportunity .

uh-huh .

that 's the key to the city of pasadena , which mr. lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic , uh .

yeah man . well , you know , the dude abides .

would n't miss the semis . how things been goin ' ?

howdy do , dude .

thankie . . . just one thing , dude . d'ya have to use s'many cuss words ?

i like your style , dude .

mm .

ahh , not so good , man .

regrettably , it 's true , standards have fallen in adult entertainment . it 's video , dude . now that we 're competing with the amateurs , we ca n't afford to invest that little extra in story , production value , feeling .

white russian , thanks . how 's the smut business , jackie ?

this is quite a pad you got here , man . completely unspoiled .

hey , relax man , i 'm a brother shamus .

relax , man ! no physical harm intended !

no ! no ! no ! that 's not --

what ?

so ... that doctor .

yeah , okay , but see , the dude --

he thought i had your father 's money , so he got me out of the way while he looked for it .

oh ?

uh-huh .

jeffrey .

well yeah ... i know that .

huh ? autobahn . a-u-t-o . their music is a sort of -- ugh -- techno-pop .

and please do n't call her my mother .

she most certainly was not !

i , uh ... money , yeah , i got ta respecfully , 69 you know , tender my resignation on that matter , 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all .

do you have any news regarding my father 's money ?

yeah , but what about --

thousand , yes , bones or clams or whatever you call them .

yeah , but my-

little lebowski urban achievers , yes , and proud we are of all of them . i asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the foundation account and he told me about this `` abduction '' , but i tell you it is preposterous . this compulsive

he fixes the cable ?

yes mr. lebowski , these unfortunate souls can not love in the true sense of the word . our mutual acquaintance bunny is one of these .

oh , no .

you mean coitus ?

you 're not interested in sex ?

excuse me ?

right , but let me explain something about that rug --

thank you .

you 're a fuck , walter !

what the fuck does vietnam have to do with anything ! what the fuck were you talking about ? !

dude , i 'm -- it was an accident !

just because we 're bereaved does n't mean we 're saps !

we 're scattering the fucking ashes !

a hundred and eighty dollars ? !

wha .

it 's a heart attack .

what 's mine is mine .

that 's fuckin ' combat . the man in the black pyjamas , dude . worthy fuckin ' adversary .

yeah .

i mean 'nam was a foot soldier 's war whereas , uh , this thing should be a fucking cakewalk . i mean i had an m16 , jacko , not an abrams fucking tank . just me and charlie , man , eyeball to eyeball .

uh-huh .

we 're sorry , man . we 're really sorry .

you thought bunny 'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear . all you needed was a sap to pin it on , and you 'd just met me . you thought , hey , a deadbeat , a loser , someone the square community wo n't give a shit about .

this driveway .

you 're fucking polish catholic --

then why ca n't you -- fuck , never mind , just call donny then , and ask him to --

and the fucking money . and we know that this is your homework , larry .

is this your homework , larry ?

hardly dude , a new 'vette ? the kid 's still got , oh , 96 to 97 thousand , depending on the options . wait in the car , donny .

yeah , go figure . well we 'll go out there after the , uh , the .

uh .

no .

who the fuck is that ?

the in-and-out burger is on camrose .

he lives in north hollywood on radford , near the in-and-out burger --

who gives a shit about the fucking marmot !

what 're you , a fucking park ranger now ?

this whole fucking thing -- i could be sitting here with just pee-stains on my rug .

not if i have anything to say about it .

do n't run away from this , dude ! goddamnit , this affects all of us !

you want a toe ? i can get you a toe , believe me . there are ways , dude . you do n't wan na know about it , believe me .

fine , dude . as if it 's impossible to get some nail polish , apply it to someone else 's toe --

aw , fuck it .

and what do they got , dude ? my dirty undies . my fucking whites -- say , where is the car ?

walter --

that 's it . i 'm out of here .

aitz chaim he , dude . as the ex used to say .

yeah . that 's a great plan , walter . that 's fucking ingenious , if i understand it correctly . that 's a swiss fucking watch .

ya see ? nothing is fucked up here , dude . nothing is fucked . these guys are fucking amateurs --

the what ?

the fucking point is --

huh ?

the man is a sex offender . with a record . spent six months in chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old .

yeah ? wavin ' a gun around ? !

that 's your answer to everything , dude . and let me point out -- pacifism is not -- look at our current situation with that camelfucker in iraq -- pacifism is not something to hide behind .

just , just take it easy , walter .

you 're not wrong , walter , you 're just an asshole .

huh . i did not know that . well , it 's water under the bridge . and we do enter the next round-robin , am i wrong ?

fucking dog has papers , dude. -- over the line !

hey man --

first of all , dude , you do n't have an ex , secondly , it 's a fucking show dog with fucking papers . you ca n't board it . it gets upset , its hair falls out .

theodore herzel .

yeah , i could find this lebowski guy --

so who --

there 's no fucking reason -- here 's my point , dude -- there 's no fucking reason --

so no funny stuff . okay ?

where 's the fucking money , shithead !

you monsters !

all right , get out . both of you .

well , you have your story , i have mine . i say i entrusted the money to you , and you stole it .

where 's my goddamn money , you bum ? !

sure ! fuck it ! that 's your answer ! tattoo it on your forehead ! your answer to everything !

ah fuck it .

no , look . i do mind . the dude minds . this will not stand , ya know , this will not stand , man . i mean , if your wife owes --

well no , like i said , woo peed on the rug --

you told brandt on the phone , he told me . so where do i fit in ?

you 're bullies ! cowards , both of you !

all right ! there it is ! it 's fucking zero !

yeah , but i was n't over . gim me the marker , dude , i 'm marking it an eight .

someday .

he 's all yours . and i 'm not your partner .

wan na hear something more impressive ? my first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager . my girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the olympic . says maybe you < i > could < /i > take me .

i came all the way down here same as you did . keep from gettin ' killed . happened to see those jarheads beatin ' on a good collar -- habla ingles , tomas ?

not good .

pain cuts the deepest , is n't that what you said ?

well it 's in mine , too . i 'm a pureblood . i was n't turned . i was born this way . just like you . am i evil because i want to survive ? what about a wolf ? what about any predator ?

it does n't have to be like that . we do n't have to be enemies .

because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends .

why ?

it would 've been easy for you to let me die back there today , but you did n't .

what ?

really ? what are we supposed to do , then ? starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live ? what about that scumbag you just let off the hook ? a nothing . a drug-dealer . how do you justify saving people like that ?

he 's right about one thing . we do have to survive .

i 've never seen anything like this . the reapers are as different from us as we are from you . it 's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies , creating new , parasitic organs which consume the old ones .

i did n't know .

no . they 've been training to hunt you .

then they were n't created to go after your `` patient zero '' .

you 're missing the point . their vampire victims do n't die . they turn . they become carriers . if the reapers continue unchecked , there could be thousands of them before the month is over . do the math .

seems like he 's doing me a favor , then .

why ?

i did some checking on that carter stevens character . that familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the nih ? turns out he used to work for them , but he does n't anymore .

what 's your problem , whistler ?

just out connecting a few dots .

we 'll split into three units . first team that makes contact wins the prize . try to maintain radio silence from here on out .

it means i 'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you . you 've been acting strange ever since i gave you the cure . reckless , quick to anger -- you said it yourself , whistler . those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards . where 'd they get their intel ?

i 'll show you .

where were you , whistler ?

what do you think ?

either that or feeding the worms .

let 's just hope you 've kicked the thirst for good . i 'll be watching you close . you start to back-slide --

you came back for me .

so ?

you do n't have a choice . you 're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can .

and why is that ?

true , but thanks to you , we know his weakness . we can keep him contained . it 's just a matter of time before we hunt him down .

it has been said , you may have enemies whom you hate , but not enemies whom you despise . be proud of your enemy : then his success shall be yours , too . in that regard , i should thank you .

two things . one , i was on to you the moment they turned you . and two -- i switched that dud of yours back with the real one .

he was here . watching us .

so you 're going to do this ?

human ?

well you 've got it , warmblood . now what the fuck are you gon na do with it ?

getting your attention , paco .

from his father , of course .

you worry too much , stevens . i have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted .

no . this is a dangerous game , you 're playing , damaskinos .

yes ?

nobody to call in case of an emergency ?

i see from your questionnaire that you do n't have any immediate next of kin ?

what about you ? you 're not coming ?

pretty .

blade does n't talk about the old days much .

tweaked the phosphor rod , modified the collimated beam , wan na concentrate the light , get something like a uv laser going .

and you 'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change .

tell me something , skid --

china town . i need more serum . what 's all this ?

wait .

maybe not . i did some checking , she 's a hematologist . knowledge like that might come in handy .

just do it , old man .

frost ! ! !

watch me .

oh , so it 's back to pretending we 're human again , is it ? spare me the uncle tom routine . you ca n't keep denying what you are . you 're one of us , blade . you always have been .

maybe i do n't see it that way .

beautiful day , is n't it ?

how do i stop it ?

`` the blood tide '' .

the vampire god . this speaks of his return .

for them . but for me --

i ca n't -- i wo n't be able to stop --

-- tearing me -- apart .

are you all right ?

we 've got a good arrangement , that 's all . whistler makes the weapons , i use them , the vampires die -- end of story .

i do . i remember from day one . people staring at me , sensing i was different . watching the fear grow in their eyes , knowing in their hearts i was n't human .

nothing that wo n't heal by dawn .

like what ?

there are worse things than vampires out there .

graffiti --

what are you looking at ?

for some . live forever , never get old . the ultimate high .

but , he could 've --

it worked , did n't it ?

you used me as bait ? !

how did you know ?

i do n't care what you believe . i saved your life once , i do n't plan on making a habit of it . you want my advice , you 'll be out of the city by nightfall . if you 're stupid enough to stay , that 's your business .

and you honestly expect me to believe all this ?

i was in the neighborhood .

he looks different now , burns are less extreme , some of these wounds have closed up --

that 's weird --

just the blood sample from the pericardial sac .

you have n't started in on the internal organs ?

this is purely professional curiosity , karen , i swear .

i thought you promised to give me some distance ?

this is n't human blood .

please . you and the other elders would n't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it . which , of course , they do .

these archives are restricted to members of the house of erebus .

get away from him !

blade --

what makes you think we want to be cured ? blood is only part of the equation . the hunt , the killing , that 's what the thirst is really about .

that 's right . the answers were there all along , of course , scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind . waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them . my elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales . but i knew better . imagine my surprise when blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free .

the blood tide . our long-prophesied holy war against the humans . there 's a force , you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood . i 've discovered a way to invoke it .

then we 're back to square one , are n't we ? sooner or later , the thirst always wins .

on me , yes . on blade , i 'm not so sure -- the problem is , blade did n't contract the vampire virus from a bite like i did . he was born with it . the irony is , i could probably cure every vampire but him .

all right , let 's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood ?

i 'll take my chances .

and now you 're using blade to exact your revenge ?

how did you escape ?

why do you hunt them ?

blade 's unique , you know . a one in a billion anomaly . he can withstand sunlight , garlic , even silver . but he still has the thirst .

consider it a parting gift . vampire mace -- silver nitrate , essence of garlic .

my name is abraham whistler . this is blade . as for our little homunculus here --

i 'm not a witch , you 're all crazy !

closer .

i do n't ... i do n't understand them myself .

hey , folklore --

-- or incredibly fucking naive .

-- which she may have --

what 're you doing there ?

-- he 's not my husband !

mrs. leavitt --

no !

-- doubtful , mrs. leavitt . the main thing to remember is , whatever the reason , it was for the best -- it meant something was wrong .

-- the witch kills children --

this is funny ? ? this is tens of thousands of fucking dollars ! you pricks ! i 'll see you in fucking court ! !

no . what 's it doing here in the middle of the foundation ?

i dunno , probably right up there , based on her resume .

guess they thought it was safe to put some up again .

'thought those all got stolen .

-- christ almighty --

no .

i guess , yeah .

sleep .

we 'll stay overnight , get a hotel --

get your goddamn --

we 've looked at half of one tape .

yes .

why is there no `` our '' here ?

no -- < u > this < /u > is weird .

oh , < u > c'mon < /u > -- even you have to admit this is weird .

the rest of the family was crazy as rusty parr .

what is < u > this < /u > ?

no .

-- or one huge attack of group hysteria .

-- < u > myth < /u > --

domini . domini von teer .

i ca n't .

i know you 're in there , you piece of shit !

-- christ , they find out i let you have it for the weekend --

< u > before < /u > 5:00 --

absolutely .

i know , i know .

just let me get my coat off -- i had eight cups of coffee , i 'm wired for sound here .

ca n't you like just divine it ?

okay , a blur .

fine .

there , what ? i did n't see anything .

like hell . play the goddamn tape .

does it hurt ?

-- hunch . just sort 've saw 'em there .

how 'd you know they were --

-- it 's the `` blair witch cult '' -- a copy -- some pages from -- one of them on the site must 've gotten my message --

it 's < u > freezing < /u > .

how 's she going to know where to --

boy kurth .

-- i look and look in the tree , all i ever see , he 's always there watching , that stupid owl , over and over --

english .

hey , hon ' -- this is what pays the rent and tuition .

too busy eating us ?

not a great idea . especially 'cross the street .

-- coming out of the water --

we should be so lucky .

try a long walk .

yeah ?

if you 're looking at me , look elsewhere .

so where the hell am i going to sleep ?

-- which 'd be about ten bucks --

-- fuckin ' a right --

-- it 's less than four feet , just --

i ca n't !

i thought all your equipment got stolen .

-- still go see the ob in the morning --

what --

just one lock in this neighbor- hood ?

403 41st street , kids : home .

cotter , i think she 's right . why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes ?

-- what happened to the goddamn `` witch-watch ? ? ''

due for a re-load and battery check . i 'll get on it .

no problem , just give us 'til dawn and we 're gone .

< u > now < /u > you can bring the vehicle to a stop : there on the left .

right . and the check 's in the mail .

-- about the witch --

-- they 're from umass , doing some kind of fucking term paper --

the wheel .

you planning on sleeping out there ?

what ?

rusty parr had the right idea on child care .

ancient runes --

she got < u > paid < /u > .

ruins of the rustin parr house .

that they 'll start touching us inside our heads .

what 're you afraid 's going to happen ?

you gon na be alright ?

that 's why she kills children .

elly kedward ?

at least go drink it somewhere spilling it wo n't drive him to suicide .

then i have no idea .

-- the marks appear , then you disappear . like the little kurth boy , like domini , as soon as they come to full bloom -- and mine < u > are < /u > !

what the fuck 's going on here ?

not this one .

-- or lyme disease or poison sumac , or god knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods .

we 're not dealing with fucking logic here !

that feels good . lower -- down into my neck .

-- it 's not a could 've -- there < u > was < /u > , nick . and it fucked up anna , and did something to domini , and it caused my father to die , and it 's here < u > with < /u > us in this place < u > now < /u > . and i do n't have one single idea in hell what 's going to happen next , just that it 's going to happen to one of us . and then the other . and then the other . it 's going to get into our < u > brains < /u > .

she 's off her fucking rocker --

nick , what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn < u > doctor < /u > .

whatever -- all i know is the persecution 's going to start all over again , they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie --

the good old days : toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch .

-- she was n't a witch -- we embrace nature , not evil --

-- yes , ma'am , can i help you with anything else ? --

-- the sheriff 's office --

-- yes --

could i tell him what it 's regarding ?

he 's in a meeting . could i have him --

yes ! i need to speak to sheriff von teer .

i 'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral .

yes .

go ahead .

take her to my house . my dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone . do you have anything to put around her ?

no .

okay .

really . you want to dance with someone else ?

really ?

it 's okay .

i 'd rather not talk about it . i 'll tell you about it sometime .

just go over to gelford and up to vista . it 's not far . can you tell me any more about what you learned ?

where to ?

jeffrey . are they important things ? well forget me - you have to tell him . jeffrey . i mean it .

yeah .

oh yeah ?

number one . i saw the yellow man go into frank 's building , laughing with frank . now . the only trouble is . what does this prove ?

yeah , but . i do n't think it 's going to do much good . let 's go . i 'll try to talk to him later .

you were late .

goodnight .

no , silly - i 'm still in school you know . but i 'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you 've learned . you better be careful , jeffrey .

i do n't know . i had a dream . in fact . the night i met you . . in the dream the world was dark because there were n't any robins . you know , birds . robins stood for love . and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love . and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference . i guess . until the robins come there is trouble .

why are there people like frank . why is there so much trouble in this world . ?

who , me ? why should it ?

did you see her undressed ?

yes .

what 's with mike ?

i 'll honk four times so you 'll hear it and know she 's on her way up . okay ?

i 'm going to wait here until she comes .

. i wish you would n't do this . it does n't make any sense . let 's go somewhere and have some coffee .

why not ?

here 's to . an interesting experience .

two .

this is not my usual friday night !

then we 'll drive back to her apartment and i will plant myself there .

what 's the plan .

okay . you better get out before someone sees us .

yeah .

i was just about to go to the door , when that man did my job for me . was it alright ?

alright . good luck , yourself .

alright .

you will be a jehovah 's witness . i have a few `` awake '' magazines for you . you do n't have to keep her very long . a few seconds is all i 'll need . whatiya think ?

what will i say when she comes to the door ?

settle down . i have a plan which i think will work . there is very little for you to do , but i do need your help . .are n't you curious about my plan ?

you said it was a strange world . and you 're the strangest part of it . are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder . this gives me the creeps .

there are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience . sometimes , in some cases . it 's necessary to take a risk . i got to thinking . i 'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman 's apartment . you know . sneak in and hide and observe .

i 'm here , are n't i ?

just a minute . pull over and wait a minute .

yeah . good bye .

i 've got ta go in .

i do n't know . he moved away .

my father is watching the businessman . the businessman had a partner who disappeared . left his whole business and family , his wife and two kids . they think he 's been murdered .

i do n't know . like i said , she 's not my father 's case .

i do n't know . you 're not supposed to see them . they 're supposed to see you .

what do you know about the ear ? . anything ?

what else is new ? . right ?

no . you 're not bothering me . you a senior ?

yeah , how did you know ?

good to see you , son .

looks like they 've got you strapped in pretty good .

do you want the car ?

i 'm going out for awhile .

jeffrey , when you see your father .

jeffrey , breakfast is ready .

this is it .

jeffrey . honey . your father 's condition is serious . it 's going to cost so much . we just wo n't have the money to keep you in school . i 'm telling you this now , so that you can get your things together and check out of school , honey , or whatever you have to do . it 'll save you another trip back . you 're going to have to work at the store .

well , most guys do n't . i mean that 's the point . you all mind if i take my vitamins ?

well .

sandy ? ... sandy , please .

nice of you to offer , jeffrey , but certainly not . just relax and enjoy your coffee . i 'm sure sandy will be back soon .

mrs. williams ? thanks for the cake .

really , he 'll be home soon , would you like a cup of coffee ?

hello . uh . my name is jeffrey beaumont . is detective williams in ?

hey come here , you stole my girl , you bastard . i 'm gon na kick your ass , right in front of your stupid house .

okay .

come on out a minute , okay ?

yeah , nice meetin ' yuh .

mike 's got ta go . nice to meet you .

on the plane .

greetings , mr. george .

um-hmm .

no . i have the space . i figured it out . this is what i want to do .

three-hundred kilos is a very big load , georgie . why do n't we start small ?

that 's impossible . we ca n't be up and running . who 's distributing ?

what ?

mama , vos sos bien antigua . como lo va a matar con un picahielo . eso era en su tiempo , estamos casi ya en los ochenta . el lo va a meter un tiro , lo va a volar , le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima .

blanca , por favor .

que queres decir . que es lo que el va hacer ? pues , no va hacer nada .

que va hacer ?

lawyer says he can plead it down to five years . i 'll serve two .

baby , you did n't have to come .

oh my g-d , how embarrassing were they ? i wanted to shoot myself .

nice first impression . a nose bleed in front of your parents .

no , not at all . sure . you 're right . you fly home and get some rest .

i 'm taking you to the doctor when we get home , and i do n't want to hear any arguments .

honey , your nose !

nothing like this back home .

yeah . i am .

derek !

i know it 's not the greatest . it 's commercial .

so you do have an agreement with the united states government , mr. jung , correct ?

i 'm doing sixty years at otisville , no chance of parole . even if they cut my sentence in half i 'll be seventy-three years old . that 's some fucking deal . i do n't know if the parole board , the judge , the pope or jesus christ himself can get me out of here . i have a really bad record , i 'm not sure what 's going to happen .

mr. jung , do n't you have an agreement or understanding with the united states government in connection with your testimony in this case ?

something about vengance being best served cold .

why are you speaking ?

my clothes , your clothes . what does it matter ?

what ? yeah , sure .

not so fast . i would like to go over the details .

i know . she needs to slow down . she 's going to blow an o-ring .

that was out of line .

for calling you a homo .

yeah . she told me .

nice doing business with you , george .

half a million for you . half a million for me . one-point-three five for the colombians .

what did i tell you ?

do n't be ridiculous , these are my babies .

and i only deal with you ?

i guess not . okay . you know , you 're very lucky you 're friends of barbie 's . if you were n't , i 'd never talk to you .

because if you are , you have to tell me . if not , it 's entrapment .

i know what you want . but , first of all , are you cops ?

get me a six pack .

oh hey , one more thing ?

you went behind my back and you cut me out .

you fucked me , diego .

derek foreal . derek foreal . derek fucking foreal . alright ? the answer to all your dreams . are you happy now ?

what ?

nothing . todo esta bien .

i 'm driving you crazy ? no . you 're driving me crazy . we had a dream . what happened to our dream ?

try the closet .

there 's no room .

try the back bedroom .

what the fuck is going on ? when did you get out of jail ?

i think it 's fair to say you underestimated the market there , derek .

jesus christ , george , i do n't see you in two years , and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine ?

i need you to go to miami .

what is it , george ? because i have to get home . i 've got a parole officer waiting for me .

that 's my george , always thinking .

it is bad . it 's chump change . we might as well be hauling suitcases across the border . we 're getting screwed .

we make the pick-up , refuel once more in the bahamas , and fly back on sunday with the mom and pop traffic .

yes . look around you . the sun . the water . the women . it 's better than danbury , no ? come on . i have some friends i would like you to meet .

yeah , i 'm out .

george , hallo ! today is the day , ah ? are you out ?

diego delgado , please ?

i do n't know . a hundred , hundred and fifty . how many miles is it from colombia to miami ?

how many kilos can we fit in these planes ?

do n't worry . we will talk of everything . we have the time . you arrive here with a bachelor of marijuana , but you will leave with a doctorate of cocaine .

yes . and a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana . everything is the same , george , except instead of thousands , you are making millions .

and that 's wholesale . cut it a few times and retail , you 're looking at two , three-hundred thousand .

i do n't know , diego . i 've got a good thing going already . everybody smokes pot . it 's easy . cocaine is a rich man 's drug . it 's too expensive .

yes , you have a dream . and maybe you accomplish your dream . but yet you failed . why ?

in my country , i am a magico . a man with a dream . a man on the rise . to take nothing and make it something , okay ? i have failed my dream , but i will accomplish . that is why i am in your country . yes , i lose my freedom . but they do not take my dream . do you have a dream , george ?

good night .

what 's the other one ?

i thought you said we were roommates . that we should talk about everything .

nothing . just a little project .

me , too . too much blah , blah , blah , blah is no good . but we are roommates , okay ? and we must talk to each other . i am arrested for stealing cars . for the grand theft auto . okay ? so , now it is your turn . now you will tell me , okay ? you will tell me why you are here ?

no ?

if you do n't mind me asking , what is the reason you are in this place ?

oh , jesus , get me a 12-lead e.k.g . and start an i.v . stat ! this man is having a heart attack .

cocaine ? how much ?

he 's in tachycardia . george , your heart is racing . have you been using drugs ?

mom .

thank you . have you been getting the money i sent you ?

that 's right . layaway . something you would n't know anything about , you cheapskate .

layaway shmayaway .

i 'm sorry , george .

diego ?

yeah , well ...

money .

keep them coming .

family .

yes .

un rata - no good . but he could have run , fled the country . gone to the policia . but then his wife , his children , his parents , his friends , many people would die .

i meant every word of it .

... you sonofabitch . putting on george 's boots .

and that fbi agent , trout ? when he had to get on his knees to put my boots on ? you said ...

tell mom , you know ...

give this to mom , will you ?

good .

no , dad . i do n't want to ... i mean , i just do n't want ...

what are you going to do ?

i know .

that 's too bad . you would have been the first one in the family .

you hear about your old friend , diego ?

figured what out ?

we sell it . i got it all figured out . we make three finger lids and sell them on the beach . we move all of it . we 've made ourselves a hundred bucks . or a lot of weed for our head . what do you think ? not bad , huh ? i got the baggies and everything .

it 's oregano . you got ripped off , pal . what are you gon na do with all this ?

better than you .

hey , george . you okay ?

hey , look . you start paying , who knows what will happen . you 're a good father , george . i always gave you that . but you 've got to talk to her .

yeah , so i 've been thinking . i love her , y'know ? i kind of want to have her . i 've been away for so long . make up for the missed time , you know ?

what do you want me to say ? i 'm in prison . you should know . you put me here .

what ?

my problem ? we 're broke , that 's my fucking problem . and you 're a fucking spy .

what are we going to do ? ! what are we going to use for money ? !

no , that 's alright .

look , mirtha . she 's walking .

pablo said no . it 's all over . and i 'm never going back . i have you . we have the baby . and there 's nothing else . it 's just the family now . shhh . sleep now .

pablo said no ?

why are you smiling ?

hello .

shhhh .

i know , dad . i know ...

i do n't believe you .

you let me take care of your mother . you just pack your bags .

yeah . go out there , check it out , see what it 's like . i 've got some stuff to do this week , but i 'm thinking maybe thursday . thursday after school .

i do n't know . maybe california .

where are you going ?

california .

no . i just kind of like the sound of it .

yeah .

you mean , like a trip ?

let me ask you something . if you could go anywhere in the world , anywhere , where would you want to go ?

do what you want , it 's a free country .

dad .

well , here i am . see ?

what are you doing here ?

are we gon na split up ?

let the record state the witness has identified , diego delgado .

do you see him here in the courtroom ?

i do n't give a shit . split it up . have a great life . i 'm done . i 'm out . starting over . cheers .

you 're looking at him . we provide the plane , transportation cost , u.s. landing spot , and take it to wherever you want it to go . you provide the pick up point in south america , and are responsible for payment . you assume all the bust risks . we take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees , ten percent of the gross , plus our expenses . this is not a negotiation , so if this is okay with you , we can talk further . if not , we can forget we had this conversation .

what if i brought you , let 's say , fifty thousand dollars ? would that eliminate some of your concerns ?

for instance , something like this ?

ramon tells me you are looking for some mota .

okay . so we need a source . where do we start ?

when there 's something to move , it 's too easy not to . do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius ? u. mass , amherst , b.u ... .

yeah ?

this is bullshit , george . we 're never going to find anything down there .

the un is far away , dear sir . it is easier to make oneself heard with bombs . if i were in their place , i would use bombs .

the strike is a success ; but ...

look around . i 've put everything at your disposal . go take a look with your own eyes .

i understand . what 's your question ?

it depends on you .

in indochina , < u > they < /u > won .

third group .

what `` group '' ?

second district , casbah , west algiers .

sid ahmed .

go ahead ! c'mon ... repeat everything from the beginning , and then we 'll let you go . name ...

you 've got to change occupations , hacene . right away !

the nlf has condemned you to death .

why are you afraid ? we 've always been friends . one might even say that i brought you up ... is n't it true , ali ?

no . not you , or any one of us . as long as we are free , the nlf continues to exist in the casbah . if they manage to take us too , there wo n't be anything left ... and from nothing comes nothing ...

of course . as soon as possible .

no , it 's better if he does n't . the house is filled with new people .

not enough .

then do n't complain .

c'mon ... you 're exaggerating . the orders were to shoot him in the back .

i do n't even know your name yet ...

with the others . they are trying to stop the people .

here ?

yes ... yes . the problem also involves the un . i do n't know what it 's worth , but this way , we 'll give the un the possibility of evaluating our strength .

no , they 'll do even more . we 've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... do you understand what i mean ? starting tomorrow , they wo n't be groping in the dark any more ; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy , a self-confessed criminal ... and they will be able to pass to the offensive . have you thought of this ?

it 's clear . they 'll do everything possible to make it fail .

be careful now . unless you know how it works , it 's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...

it 's too late . no one is allowed to enter the casbah at this hour . it 's impossible .

good evening , sir .

tell me ... where is this rue de thbes ?

intersection , between consular street and general laquiere avenue ...

bah , for that matter , algeria is n't the only country in the world ...

yes , i believe there wo n't be any more talk of the nlf for some time .

no . let 's just say that you 've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly . but from the technical point of view , it is n't possible to speak of advantages . by now the game is over . the nlf has been defeated .

are you ready , colonel ?

thanks , mister d .

i do n't know .

what would joanne braslow need with an estate attorney ? she was n't even mentioned in marsh 's will .

joanne braslow is getting more and more interesting . i followed her today to an attorney 's office . joseph koehler .

no -- but i got something .

i 've been waiting for you to get back .

before you ask there 's nothing new on the coke .

how ?

marsh 's cardiologist told me that after marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking , quit drinking and started exercising every day . does that sound like a guy who 'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose ?

it would be the same as shooting a gun at him .

what would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to mr. marsh and then induced him to make love ?

your honor , the state enters this evidence as exhibit a. were any fingerprints found on the bottle ?

is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand ?

no .

yes .

but there 's more ?

the official cause of death was a cardiac arrest .

marsh was n't alone . we found traces of sperm on the sheets . the toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood .

cause ?

about three hours .

did you ever see mr. marsh use cocaine ?

could you be more specific ?

what was the nature of the argument ?

what did they argue about ?

objection , your honor .

you may call your next witness .

your honor , i 'm trying to establish a pattern in dr. paley 's behavior with women .

your honor , i 'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal miss lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was .

objection . the question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness .

you do n't know what you 're talking about .

that 's ridiculous .

your honor -- please !

are n't they all ?

c'mon -- think about it . if she was going to kill marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find ?

that 's correct -- but andrew never told me he had a heart condition . he said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious .

yes .

miss braslow -- i 'm district attorney john cardenas . you arrived at what time tonight ?

no . she stopped by to pick up some papers .

did miss lawson ever accompany mr. marsh to your office ?

yes .

she was .

did you change your will while you were with miss lawson ?

it 's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is .

it did n't .

i had bypass surgery .

what happened next ?

i know this is a very personal subject , but could you be a little more specific ?

how long were you together ?

-- and what did you suggest ?

yes -- several times .

did you ever see her again after that ?

at a dinner party -- about eight months ago .

that 's all dr. paley .

if necessary i can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence .

you did n't grab her and try to kiss her ?

we had dinner at a restaurant .

then you have no way of knowing what mr. marsh told miss lawson were the reasons for his visits ?

yes -- quite easy .

what did you prescribe for her ?

-- and is miss lawson a patient of yours ?

high school ?

do you remember his exact words ?

yes -- he did .

did he make your life miserable ?

miss sellers , do you know dr. alan paley ?

then why did you go see mr. koehler in the first place ?

would you read for us the time of the purchase ?

two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money . that must have made you pretty angry ?

she talked him into it . she wanted everything .

you do n't like her because you were involved with mr. marsh before she came along . is n't that true ?

money is n't the only reason people commit murder , miss braslow .

yes , i slept with him but that was a long time ago .

yes . i suppose it 's possible .

so , is n't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love ? that what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it did n't stop it was going to kill him . that if she did leave his heart could n't take it .

he said that if it kept up she was going to kill him . that his heart could n't take it .

i was at the house one morning -- i thought miss lawson was upstairs with mr. marsh . when i went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial .

what about miss lawson ?

i was n't lookin ' through the keyhole if that 's what you 're thinking . i 'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to andrew . i 'd find their little toys all over the place .

andrew was a kind and gentle man , but he was thirty years older than her . where 's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had .

i take it you do n't like miss lawson very much ?

sorry .

i need to ask you a question . what made you get in touch with joanne braslow ?

yes .

do n't listen to him . ca n't you see he 's trying to turn you against me .

no -- i 'm a survivor .

no -- you 're not .

i 'm dropping the case .

you killed him -- did n't you ?

you 're too weak , frank . when you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it . if something gets in your way you remove it .

to celebrate how masterfully you destroyed roston today .

what does that mean ? you 've been thinking about the case ? or you thought everything out before you killed marsh ?

there 's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me , frank .

you and me -- making love .

yes -- it would be nice .

it 's hard to let go of a dream , is n't it ? to let go of what you want ?

i broke my ankle skating . that ended that dream .

really ?

no -- i wanted to be a professional hockey player .

it wo n't be that hard .

sorry .

andrew loved this old cabin . he always dreamed about moving to tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum . i could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it , he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful . soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it 's problems behind . i wish he 'd had a chance to do it .

no -- not at the office . i 've got a better idea .

i just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow .

nothing .

is it against the law ?

i know .

i was at a cocktail party . very trendy . andrew was in chicago on business . he had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling . he looked so helpless .

because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it .

how ?

i 'm used to being on the outside looking in . the same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together .

this is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex .

i want you to know right now that the trial 's going to be nasty . your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud . they 're going to say that you enticed marsh -- led him down a dark path .

and that 's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me . that 's why i need a very good lawyer , mr. dulaney .

not a very good one i 'm afraid .

you must have some feeling . some immediate impression . a young , attractive woman , involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will . and the things that went on in that house . such wild sex . what kind of picture does that paint ?

are you going to represent me ?

alright , i 'll talk to her

we 've already got press arriving from over the country and she has n't even been charged yet . cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten . i 'd like you to go with her .

what are they saying ?

are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing ?

how often do you use cocaine ?

mr. cardenas , i suggest you move on to another line of questioning .

maybe you do n't know what it 's like where mrs. crawford comes from -- but i do . i came from a neighborhood just like hers . this is a whole other world for her . she 's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people . so , she puts on her best dress , fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible . being poor and having pride is not a crime , mr. dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness ' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics .

please -- not now .

you would n't like what you 'd see . you do n't know me anymore . i do n't know me anymore .

it 's bad enough that you are . it 's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me .

working . charlie and i were going over some statements .

sharon , it 's late . can we get to the point ?

what 's wrong ?

yeah -- what are you doing up ?

no one 's asking you not to work . i just think you could make some time for your son .

i 'll talk to him later .

frank -- i know you 're busy , but michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him . he wanted to know why you were n't talking to him .

humped

she sounds like quite a woman .

if he files are you going to take the case ?

how can cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults ?

hello ? ... hi raymond ... . what ? ... well , i was sort of planning on ... alright ... okay , goodbye . that was sattler . he thinks the d.a . 's going to file on rebecca lawson . he wants me in the office tomorrow morning .

ca n't it wait ?

really ?

this is not relaxing .

i am relaxing .

no , it 's not . now i get to pitch .

that 's too bad .

did marsh use it ?

well , there 's a lot of boring stuff to do . lists of people we have to write to . find mama 's relatives addresses in italy -- stuff like that .

why are there two deeds here ?

not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --

oh jesus .

you said it in that tone ! like you were angry at me , my brother , at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch !

we were here two christmases ago .

boy . it sure has been a long time .

oh , just a old letter from a friend .

i know . i do n't understand it either .

did we want to ?

i used to love this place . i used to take kathy reynolds down here .

i think i better . between the book and the coffee , i 'm this close to raping the busboy .

i do n't think so . not yet anyway . and besides , something like that does n't make you a bad person . he reminds me of steve in a way . steve 's weak , immoral and a liar but he 's still a real nice guy . he just should n't be married . at least not to me . you getting hungry ? i 'm hungry .

oh , he did not . he 's such a nice guy .

how did she meet him ? did dad know ? anything else in that envelope ?

i ca n't believe she never told me ? we spoke at least once a week . how could she do that ?

what 's he saying now ?

i remember a mrs. delaney but mama told me years ago she died .

i have some sandwich fixings if you 're hungry .

mrs. delaney . did you hear the latest ?

not this kind of heat .

i do n't know . i woke up a little dizzy . i did n't sleep well . i think i need to lay down .

to hell with you !

we are the choices we 've made , robert .

for anyone . they 'll never be able to live through the talk . richard will never be able to . he does n't deserve that . he has n't hurt anyone in his life .

for who ?

no matter how i keep turning it around in my mind -- it does n't seem like the right thing .

if i 've done anything to make you think that what 's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then i do apologize .

because i ca n't have you !

i do n't want to need you !

i wo n't be made to feel like i 've done something wrong .

stop it !

gee , i do n't know . i guess i 'm not cut out to be a world citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time .

what are you doing ?

i do n't know why i 'm so tired all of a sudden .

across the street . she went into the park and got turned around and did n't know her way out .

i just wondered . why were you trouble ?

no , i do n't mind .

no . i could n't .

he 's a genius . they 're not photographs -- they 're stories , entire histories captured in moments .

you know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas ...

take me somewhere .

no .

no . i ca n't . not yet .

yes , that 'd be nice .

how about if i set the table ?

actually , no . i 've got everything under control . i 'd like to clean up myself a bit . i 'm going to take a bath . dinner 'll be ready in about a half hour .

fine . they 're all having a good time . how many more shots do you have ?

sorry i 'm late . richard called .

yeah ?

oh . i guess you got the whole story .

okay . see you later .

i would love to come for dinner .

francesca ?

i thought that 's what we were doing -- asking questions .

my mistake . i apologize .

do you want to leave your husband ?

no . but i love them just the same .

no .

no , i think i need everyone ! i love people . i want to meet them all ! i just think there are too many out there saying `` this is mine . '' or `` she 's mine . '' too many lines have been drawn . world 's breaking apart because of man 's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people . he wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly .

i 'm a loner , i 'm not a monk .

never touch the stuff . i 've got friends all over the world . good friends i can see when i want , if i want .

yes .

you 've got it all right here , you know . it 's just as beautiful as any other place i 've seen . god , it knocks me out .

when ?

have no fear . this shoshone medicine woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root .

no . it 's all right . i just meant , it might be a little dull for you , telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere .

do you miss it ?

i do n't know if obsessions have reasons . i think that 's why they 're obsessions .

why , do you think ?

`` making pictures . '' i like that . you really love what you do , do n't you ?

nah . i 've tried . my writing 's too technical , i think . problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent . i better just stick to making pictures .

would you like to stay for dinner ? there are n't many choices in town and ... anyway , you 'd have to eat alone . so would i .

you have no reason to feel ashamed . you have n't said anything you do n't have a right to . and if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me .

i feel so embarrassed .

much .

and clean .

what 's he like ?

a little place with cabins . the something-motor inn . i have n't checked in yet .

where are you staying while you 're here ?

francesca .

oh ! you caught me .

no , i do n't mind . i 'm not from here . i was born in italy .

you do n't look like a native , if you do n't mind my saying so .

uh ... uh ... umm ... long time .

oh .

uh-huh . lived there till i was twenty or so and then moved to chicago when i got married .

are you from washington originally ?

if i 'm not taking you away from anything .

what about his engagement to dyan cannon ?

mrs. johnson ! mrs. johnson ! is it true cary grant has proposed to you ?

hmm ?

i 'm not tired . i thought i might finish carolyn 's skirt .

sure .

kinda pretty . is this uh ... jazz kinda singing ?

yes . i 'm fine . it 's just this heat i think .

they 're not going to find her !

what happened ?

who the hell is lucy delaney ?

it clearly states in the will --

why do n't you hang on and i 'll see if she 's here .

alright . yes sir . anything you say .

take my advice . and shoot that dog . or let me .

then what do you care ?

hell no !

go for it .

... bones ol ' bones so mean and bad , whupped his mamma , shot his dad .

damn . it 's so ... fresh .

's up ?

the man said just to use my imagination . let 's see ... yeah , i get it . potential . i can see it now . the first major urban theme park . village ghetto land . kinda like legoland , but made entirely from broken glass , hypodermic needles and crack vials . totally e-ticket .

yeah , in the land of the blind the one eye 'd are king .

anywhere but here .

spooked ?

shit .

you want us to move in here ?

i do alright . everybody 's happy .

where we 'll always be ...

i want you to do something for me , baby .

must be my clothes line . no ? how bout my phone line ?

left hand 's the past . your right 's the present . and the future . but it 's not written in stone . it 's written in flesh and blood . and flesh and blood will change . see ? there 's something here , a new line , right across your life line .

all that shinin ' and `` reader and adviser '' mess . that was your mama 's bag . i do n't know about the readin ' but you both can sure 'nuff advise .

what will it take ? what do you want ? just tell me , jimmy !

time like this , is that what you really want to know ? how i got the fuck in here ?

since we was just grasshoppers ...

sorry , my brother .

trust me , jimmy , there 's big money behind this . not just big . big . like big business big . big corporation big . big government big . our little acre alone 'll net hundreds a thousands . nothing but net .

they get about twelve and a half minutes . tops .

my god . my dress . we have to find it . and burn it . and shut the door .

in his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something . covered with blood .

told you so . alright . we tried . let 's go home .

we 'll have to sneak in .

but how do you know ? maybe he just wanted to see us ? and now he 's gone again . and you 've all killed my father for the second time .

it 's alright , baby .

... i 've seen things . in there . last night . you did too . do n't tell me you did n't . you were crying like a baby .

you mean as opposed to your life ?

we got ta jump !

okay , okay . listen :

patrick , he 's ...

it 's alright . if you want to go home ...

if i did , i would n't come within fifty yards of your door .

and you believe her ?

lucky thing .

maybe . but there 's an invisible wall , a fabric that kinda keeps things separate .

way i figure , everything our parents tell us is part true and part total b.s . and our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which .

nothing . you 'd think she was crazy . and she is a lot of things , not all of them nice , but crazy momma 's not .

i manage them .

where is it ?

yeah , but you got to come the rest of the way on foot . leave your car and walk over here .

you got the cash ?

back here . at the end of the block .

we 're here . where the hell are you ?

please ... help me ...

dead ? i do n't think your past is dead . it 's alive . and it bites .

you were just a kid .

from what ?

i would n't have risked killing you to get you out . i was trying to protect you .

did you do it ?

you cut him , or i shoot you . make your choice .

no way man ...

keep your hands to yourself , willya ?

you certainly traded up . ... the trophy wife . nice lookin ' .

fair enough for the shit . but i think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition .

i ai n't killed nobody . shall i rack 'em ? play a game , lupe ?

goddamnit ! how many times i told you --

it was just like in my head .

then how 'd you hear it , fool ?

you gon tell me you did n't ginsu those punks and steal their ride ?

`` like a heartbeat/like a love beat . '' listen to the di franco twins there . just the plumbing or something , fool .

why do n't y'all check out the rest ? i 'm going downstairs and see if i can get the furnace fired up . warm this place up , you 'll see . it has serious potential .

you got ta use your imagination .

jimmy bones ?

i was planning on waiting until i got the place cleaned out , but -- like the man says , carpe diem .

sqweeep . we innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin -- `` aliens from reticula 3 have hijacked patrick peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop ... ''

no thanks .

need any help with those bags , ma'am ?

the blood is still there . we just got ta figure out where .

save him ? what are you talking about ?

shit ! damn dog . we gon na have to do something about you .

ours !

the same way you did before .

open the case !

that you overreacted . that you lost it . not me . it was your mistake .

where is this going , johnnie ?

give it to me .

caesar , do n't .

tell them i 'm at st. mary 's off the kennedy , in the waiting room , but stay on the phone until i come out .

you 're blowing your only chance . act like i 'm gino .

you need the money just like we do .

do n't try to tell me what to do .

it 's not here , caesar .

no i did n't . not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here . then they never showed up .

caesar , you just killed gino marzzone .

once we have the money , then none of this ever happened .

caesar , what are you going to do ?

... maybe three hours .

tell them ! tell them !

shut up , violet ! this is between me and johnnie .

maybe it is , maybe it is n't . maybe you dropped the scotch by accident . maybe you did n't .

if you 're not with me , violet , then i have to assume you 're against me .

the hell i ca n't !

see , right now he does n't know that i know , that 's why he put the paper in the case . he wants me to hand the case to gino . then there is no doubt it was me . gino will put a bullet in me himself . but it ai n't going to happen . i wo n't let it ! johnnie ai n't going to fuck me ! not like this ! no way !

but you know he did it .

i hate that little fuck ! i hate him ! i hate him ! i should 've done him !

it 's impossible !

what are you , drunk ?

they were early .

do n't be silly , caesar . it 'll take five minutes .

fuck ! fuck ! how did you ... awwww goddammit !

what are you going to do with it ?

just look at this mess i got to deal with .

not bad . what for ?

what ? it ai n't no big fuckin ' deal . i know who don hires . did you know he did time himself ?

so , you just got out ?

she 's doing the work herself .

what the fuck is going on ?

i did n't expect --

all part of the business .

we make our own choices , we pay our own prices .

oh , right .

it 's all right , sir .

when i reach ten , then i 'll start with you .

where is it ?

what ? how about a drink ?

i should be going .

you 're helping rajeev ?

you planned this whole thing , did n't you ?

you got the key ?

fuck it , i do n't need the key .

sure , cease . they make us do stupid things , do n't they .

why 'd you move all the furniture around ?

me ? why ?

that violet is one nice lady . wish someone would help me relax .

yeah , mick . i 've got the money . i 'm staring right at it .

okay . let me call around . i 'll see what i can do . do n't go anywhere , okay ?

no . i do n't know where they are . i even called over at johnnie 's , but no answer .

sure , mickey . sure .

caesar , did n't i tell you to get something ?

... thank you .

oh , thank god .

believes it ! jesus , it 's driving him crazy . he wants to kill him . i do n't know , corky , i do n't know what he is going to do . i 'm getting nervous , really nervous .

it 's me .

i think we 're going to find out .

i had a partner and she fucked me .

why ?

i 'm just asking , what if ?

you ca n't know for certain that he wo n't see you .

waiting in the apartment next door .

any bodyguards ?

the plane is in at seven , so i 'd say about eight .

it 's getting better and better . keep going .

what happened ?

yeah .

... shit .

it sounded like he and caesar do n't like each other .

it 's in a case , on his desk .

then what ? exactly .

i think ...

is that what you think ?

all right , let 's say for the moment that i believe everything you are saying .

i am , but ...

these people are serious , violet . if you want to know how serious , ask shelly . they 're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules . you fuck them , you 've got to do it right .

i think so , too .

do n't tell me , you 're a workaholic .

what about that guy this morning ?

work .

what was it then ?

what are you saying ? that you do n't have sex with men ?

let me guess . this is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside . that inside you , there is a little dyke just like me ?

my cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught . she was always more honest than me .

i 'm already in your bed .

funny , nobody calls it that anymore . caesar calls it `` the |business . ''

caesar 's mafia , is n't he ?

... i needed that .

i wanted to apologize .

look , i do n't think this is a good idea .

... yes .

if i say yes , will you take your hand away ?

curious ? that 's funny , i 'm feeling a bit curious myself right now .

a beer . of course .

sure .

i 'm sorry , look , forget it . i should n't have called ...

yeah , come on in .

thanks .

truck . of course .

yes , it really causes problems . sometimes it 's like you 're in the same room . but if it 's too much trouble , i understand ...

are they really ?

yeah , see , i 'm kind of a night person , so i was wondering if it was n't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools .

my pleasure ... but to be honest , i did have a slightly ulterior motive here . i was wondering if i could ask a small favor ?

rajeev , the man who usually works on the building .

who ?

pop , this is important to me . it 's a simple question . if he would just answer the question , that 's the end of it .

done . we go now .

caesar , come here . sit . we talk now . you too , johnnie .

you are as radiant as ever , violet .

i think everything is okay .

caesar ? what the fuck time is it ?

do n't worry about caesar . i 'll handle caesar . you just get out of here , okay ?

caesar wants me to stay .

you 're not doing shit . you 're so scared you ca n't even think .

< u > no you 're not < /u > . you 're not going anywhere . i 'm shutting this down .

this does n't go upstairs .

i want a second opinion .

then i 'd have to explain treadstone . and you 'd have to explain how you let me get this far . does n't sound like much of a plan-b , does it ? we 'll clean up the field . you clean up your budgets .

and what if i could n't do that ?

what do they want me to do ?

i work alone . like you ... ... we always work alone .

that 'll be their second worst mistake .

jason bourne is dead .

of course . we had to try . we did n't know what was wrong . we did n't know you were in trouble .

am i treadstone ? me ? what the hell 're you talking about ?

i think investment advice from a dead man , it 's a bad idea . how does it feel to be dead ?

mpg capital .

yeah , i know ...

sir , you waited on line .

< u > do you have your passport , sir < /u > ?

one moment , please ... i 'm afraid , i have no one by that name registered , sir .

his brother . you know his brother ?

... we actually , we were unaware for several days that this had happened . when they came for his things , it was made known for us , you see ?

yes , i 'm here ...

that 'd be great .

let me get you a new copy of the proposal .

we just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you . gorgeous boat , hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser . i think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job , as i said , a bit more competitive .

yes .

i 'm gon na find the end of this . i ca n't protect you .

xxxxxx

xxxxxx

xxxxxx .

go back to the hotel .

-- i do n't know what you 're doing and you 're scaring me -- what are you looking for ? -- what just happened in there ? --

it 's a company ... mpg capital .

-- forget it --

-- we 'll explain it --

and where is he now ? you believe what you want , but i 'm telling you the truth -- i never would have brought you here if i thought it was dangerous .

you 're wrong . i did n't know .

-- we ca n't stay here -- i ca n't stay here -- it 's not safe here --

he 's dead is n't he ?

-- just --

what ? -- what ? -- -- what is it ?

-- please -- jason -- omigod --

-- no -- marie -- < u > no < /u > ! -- it 's not like that --

see . it 's starting to come back , yeah ? you mind if i take a bath ?

you got me pretty fucking curious .

thanks for the ride .

so this is it , right ?

looks familiar ?

that 's it ? is that it ?

you ever think maybe you have a family ?

i needed a break .

people do amazing things when they 're scared .

sounds like you were in an accident or something .

when you think of it , before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship , what do you see ?

what ? like amnesia ?

i do n't know . i do n't know who i am .

i 'm sorry . really . what do you want me to do ?

shit -- can i tell you how much you 're freaking me out ? okay ? because you are -- you 're completely freaking me out .

wait up -- -- just wait up --

jesus ...

get the fuck away from my car .

i 've got a situation here and --

-- here we go -- i found it --

that old beast ? miss his breakfast ? not a chance . it 's always something , right ?

-- it 's not the source of the information that 's important here --

you only know that because i told you ! ask the case officer -- find his name -- it 's on the papers -- i told him all this myself ! --

all the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- i brought all the papers --

it 's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just ...

what 's that ?

maybe it 's a game . maybe he 's trying to send us a message .

-- yes , sir , it 's confirmed --

-- he accessed the account --

what ?

it 's not much , but it should get you to switzerland .

you drink rum ?

no .

how did i get here ?

... and then some .

... your ducts ?

uh - what ? - i ...

i think you 've got your t41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control . it 's either that or a new washer .

this is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts .

... have a look .

you telephone , sir .

we know everything here . this is the storeroom of knowledge .

jill layton ... you 're a very good little girl . what are you doing here ?

her name is jill .

go away .

thank you very much , deputy minister .

i understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers . people want value for money and a cost-effective service .

and the cost of it all , deputy minister ? seven percent of the gross national produce ...

- in fact , killing people - they 'd get a lot more out of life .

sam , if you 've been going out there and playing a straight bat , all the way down the line , you 've got absolutely nothing to worry about .

well ... well , i ...

i know he would have wanted me to help you ... and i promised your mother i 'd take you onto the team at information retrieval . but i gather that ...

jack , i 'm innocent ! help me .

there are no coincidences , sam . everything 's connected , all along the line . cause and effect . that 's the beauty of it . our job is to trace the connections and reveal them . this whole buttle/tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside . bye bye .

she 's innocent , jack -- - she 's done nothing wrong .

sam ... we 're proud to have you at information retrieval . merry xmas .

do you know what you 're doing .

well , i 'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does . let me borrow her dossier for a while .

they were n't at school with us .

then we 'd better keep this business just between the two of us .

and you 're mine .

of course . we went to school together . you 're my oldest friend .

trust me . you do trust me , do n't you ?

you mean you 're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department ?

tell me about layton .

we suspect him of freelance subversion .

so how ... ?

sam , there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but buttle 's heart condition did not appear on tuttle 's file . do n't think i 'm dismissing this business , sam . i 've lost a week 's sleep over it already .

you clever bastard ! i might have guessed . you only moved in today and you 're already hot on the bloody trail .

ok. come back this afternoon , about four o'clock . if you give me the number of the case , i 'll have the dossier here waiting . my tailor , ... well worth the investment .

i do n't want to take up your time now , but i was hoping you could give me some information on somebody . it 's a security level three matter and information retrieval records says to refer to you .

what ?

mr helpmann !

quite , absolutely - i always thought they were false .

what ? - oh , yes - vividly . i used to wonder if they were real .

well , since you disappeared up the ladder of information retrieval ... i do n't expect to see you slumming in records - what 's the problem ?

jack !

sam !

well do n't . you 're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive ! and if you do n't stamp this form i 'm going to blow the place up !

you do n't exist any more . i 've killed you . jill layton is dead .

make yourself at home . do n't answer the phone or open he door to anyone . i wo n't be long .

no . no . i 'm fine . i was worried sick about you ... i thought ...

yes .

i 'm going to open it !

oh ... jesus !

what ?

we ? do n't blame me !

sam ... we ca n't outrace them . you 'll kill us !

will you please turn back .

yes ... but , this is real . now , stop !

how many terrorists have you met ? actual terrorists ?

well , terrorists of course .

well , no system is .

do n't you know the sort of thing that information retrieval does ?

really .

what are you doing in information retrieval ?

what does it look like ... i 'm collecting empties .

yes , of course . sorry .

why are they all pigs at information retrieval ?

i do n't want to hear about your fucking dreams !

oh , sorry .

who are you ?

what are you doing ? for christ 's sake ! get moving !

do n't look back ! act naturally !

i never signed the form .

all information on 3rd level suspects is classified .

you are good to me sam .

oh god ! i think i 've broken a bone . what a pathetic thing i am .

of course , of course . leave it to me . how do i authorize a cheque ?

here . what do i do next ?

there we go . mrs. veronica buttle . what 's the number on the cheque ?

i mean , buttle ! it 's been confusion from the word go ! he 's been wrongly charged for electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can !

a cheque .

what a bitch !

you 've been promoted .

do n't worry .

expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of buttle , archibald , shoe repair operative , but security has invoiced admin for tuttle , archibald , heating engineer

oh , good !

it 's not the machine . there 's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers ... ah there we go ! that 's a b58/732 when it should be a t47/215 ... tuttle ... he should have 31.06 , debited against his account for electrical procedures , not buttle .

hey - that 's my desk !

oh - yes . look you 're putting me off , standing there ! go back to your office and i 'll give you a knock when i 've finished .

you have n't switched it on .

what ? look , let me use the console for a few minutes .

yes .

i 'm sorry alma , i did n't mean to sound so ...

numero une , crevettes la mayonaaise .

we 're meeting mrs terrain .

hello , spiro . merry christmas .

yes he is - he wants to talk to you .

mother ? is that you ?

what were we saying ?

no you 're not . jack lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he 's got the ambition . you have n't got the ambition but luckily you 've got me . and mr helpmann . mr helpmann was very close -

my complication had a complication , but dr chapman says i 'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle . are you buying a christmas present for your mother ?

i think that 'll hold it . hello shirley . just helping someone tie up a christmas present . how are you ?

whatever happened to you ?

hello - central services - i 'm at 579b block l9 , northwestern section d - that 's exit 1 on green pastures highway at the orange blossom flyover - and i 've got trouble with the air- conditioning

excuse me , dawson , can you put me through to mr helpmann 's office ?

madam ... cut to woman turning , half in flirtatious conversation . it is sam 's mother , but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of sam 's dream girl .

ah yes , the lady is waiting .

why not ? all you 've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it , have n't you ?

sign here please .

emergency procedures .

what the - ? how did you - ?

but we can get one .

central services .

on the house . you did me a favor . check the corridor .

why ? i came into this game for adventure - go anywhere , travel light , get in , get out , wherever there 's trouble , a man alone . now they 've got the whole country sectioned of and you ca n't move without a form . i 'm the last of a breed . ah ha ! found it ! there 's your problem .

the pace ?

well , yes ... and no . officially , only central service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... could you hold these .

a little precaution , sir . i 've had traps set for me before now . there are people in central services who 'd love to get their hands on harry tuttle .

what ?

nice and easy now . keep your hands where i can see them .

what if there is no tomorrow ?

i 'm sorry , pierce . you 're going out with marcus . duty calls . the city needs you .

i do n't think a week 's gon na do it .

i 'm sick . that 's what i 've been telling you .

two years . ever since we left island .

be cool , man . you 're having a paradoxical reaction . it can happen . did n't i tell you this guy was stressed out ?

he 's not a cop , he 's a medic . i 'm cy coates .

he looks like a cop .

hey cy , guess who 's here ?

no .

i was tired . i needed a coffee .

you 're going to live .

that 's the stuff . i call it the red lion . very king-of-the-jungle .

is this what you gave mary ?

sleep is all stress reduction . here . you take one of these , sleep two hours , that 's all you need . why do you think i 'm telling you this , frank -- for my health ? you ought to look at yourself in the mirror , man . kanita , get him a glass of water .

i should be going . i just quit .

that shit is poison , frank . we do n't drink alcohol here . what you need is one of these .

got a beer ?

i know , but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours . terrible about her father , is n't it ?

ten-four , hon .

you 're going to three-four avenue c , 17 year-old female cardiac arrest , no further information .

do n't worry , hon . young is here and he 's gon na help out -- just remember , you owe me .

she said to me , i love the way you talk on the radio .

the pitch , high heater . bucky knows what 's coming . he steps in , smash , over the green monster .

yeah ?

sure , sure , give go .

strawberry ai n't shit . drug pussy . me . i swing like reggie . mr. october . number three , game six , world series .

you 're not going to die .

you came out of the hospital . you were tied down and hallucinating . you got some bad chemicals in your head , noel . there 's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that .

excuse me . you are a very kind man . i can see that . a man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water .

there 's no time .

he 'll be all right .

or maybe you wan na fuck me ? everyone else has .

mary . mary , we 've got to get going .

promise you wo n't go inside .

i should n't have asked you to come .

i think i 'd remember that .

you must get a lot of overdoses . i bet you picked me up a couple of times .

five years .

we moved out after that . upstate .

yeah , or saint anthony . you from the neighborhood ?

my father was a great man , you know . there was nobody he would n't help . you know that crazy guy noel who i gave water to last night ? he lived in our house for almost a year . a total stranger he 'd do anything for , his own family though ...

be tough to get a taxi here . we can give you a ride if you like .

i knew . i sensed it when i heard your voice .

he 's working a double shift .

that 's what i told her . if she could just see him a second , then i could take her home .

go home . take her home . get some rest . not going to find anything out now .

i mean if he was dead , i could handle that .

the first is always the best .

it 's not so rare . he grew up on our street . he 's had a rough life and he 's a little crazy from it , but that 's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water .

what ?

please , a little decorum if you will . what i was going to say is , is that holding that baby in my arms , i felt like i was twenty-one again . a call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week , not two , start running again , cut down on the drinking .

do n't give me that look .

three legs .

i need a drink , that 's all .

make a left here . i want to stop .

i ever tell you about the time years ago i was on this ledge uptown , trying to talk this psycho inside ?

she only works when i 'm on . i make her wait and it drives her crazy .

where 's burke ?

last show of the night .

that 's good , frank . no , but they might surgically implant one , about the size of my thumb . it goes near the shoulder here , with two electrodes connected to the heart . it sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow . amazing , is n't it ?

what do you do , just have someone follow him around with a defribilator ?

the family know ?

who knows ? it 's all lower-brain-stem- activity . the heart refuses to stabilize -- he 's coded eleven times since he got here . this guy 's a fighter . every time the valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints .

what do you think ?

no , that 's noel . used to be a regular off and on , has n't been in in a while . he seized and almost coded -- i gave him a hypertonic solution . he drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt . one for the textbooks .

i hate pronouncing people dead over the phone . better , huh ? they 're fixed and dilated . he 's plant food .

he got better .

i 'm sorry .

do it !

if he sees me , he 'll run , so i 'll get out here . you start talking to him about baseball or something while i sneak around behind and get down and you push him . when he falls we get him .

he 's crazy . he ca n't help it .

let me think .

you want some bum in the bus terminal ? we 'll wait for a real call .

whadda we bring ?

whatja doing ?

look out !

tom , where are the band-aids ? this is an ambulance , is n't it ?

larry , swing over on eighth . we 're gon na hafta run one of these calls .

faster ! god !

that 's what we 're here for . come on , frank .

you wanted it turned off . there 's no such thing as a good fire . people get burned up . they ca n't breathe .

i eat . i just have n't had coffee yet .

oh yeah , you do n't eat food .

turn here . you missed it . the chink is on 3rd .

ten-four . do n't go . not this time .

yes , zebra . you 'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction , chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four . the duke of drunk , the king of stink , our most frequent flier , mr. oh .

look , frank , when i say do n't answer it , that means answer it . you can do that for me at least . three zebra .

one-three zebra . zebra three , i need you .

why ?

okay .

well , this kid could n't possibly belong to anyone else . what 's your name ?

no , i liked the way it made me sound . okay . be good . so long .

i 'm going to miss you -- you 're a prick in a great way ...

hold it down , okay ?

it is . yes -- that 's where they had rorish , for god 's sake , before they made him anchor . i ca n't stand it -- they 're grooming you for it all and you do n't even know it .

you packing up tonight ?

everybody has one like that . i thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end .

and the left side of your face is the good one . go again . and try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story . punch -- come on --

your coat jacket is rising up in back .

we sure do . i do n't mean it as a knock either . go ahead . i 'll just say what i think and you can disregard it if you want .

this is uncomfortable for me -- because , well , i do n't mean it as a knock , but we approach this differently .

okay .

do n't name them . just tell me if you know .

great . network news , washington ... i love it . what do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams ?

why do n't you lead ? i 'll just follow the flurry you cause .

you want to go out there -- get out of this for a second ?

hi , aaron ... what 's doing ?

nice , jane .

you 're almost there , you can do it -- can do -- can do .

ravenous homosexual .

which would you prefer ?

it 's mr. buddy felton ?

i think so ... they 've been talking to me about being tom 's managing editor .

i 'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we 'll bump into you on the street , my youngest son will say something and i 'll tell him ... ... it 's not nice to make fun of single , fat ladies .

you are now required to sit here with me . come on ... be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us ?

you 're just trying to say all great stuff so i 'll feel even worse that you 're not around .

tell me the god 's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me ? because if you are ...

bastard , sneak , quitter .

hi . will i ever sing again ?

you were quick enough to get tom 's help when ...

i think you 're the devil .

yeah -- being a basket case .

i do n't know . i may be in love with him .

call him -- i mean it can wait , right ?

stop kidding . i want to know what happened .

no .

do others feel that you did well ?

do you feel good about it ?

no .

how 'd it go ?

you too .

< u > if < /u > ... if not , i 'll have the tape ... i 'll wait for you at my apartment .

i 'm not sure i 'll be able to ... i ...

me too ... hey ... if it gets dull a little before 11:00 , drop by the studio .

well , the line of the jacket -- no really ... .just very nice ... just right . i wish i could be there .

because this is important -- so do n't just be polite . i 'd really like to look ... what 's the word i 'm looking for ? ...

i read about it -- that 's how you can make sure you do n't put on too much perfume ...

i did n't know you were going with him .

jesus , jane . how long have you been here ?

you 're welcome . sow how does it feel to ... i know you got ta go -- me too . we 're very busy here .

right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- nobody else will have him .

thanks . the f-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master . oh , you call them 'tomcats ' and in the 70 's the first crop had a number of crashes .

i think the pilot that shot down the libyan in 1981 is stationed right here . maybe you could get him -- and maybe tom should say that our f-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly . they 're nicknamed 'tomcats ' .

you spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap ... oh good .

nine seconds .

you want to start going over who they could have gotten ? they ca n't take on people like this for network news . for god 's sake . what 's going on ?

they did n't hire peter stiller from the < u > times < /u > and he had a great audition tape .

would n't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive ? if needy were a turn-on ?

i 'd give anything if that were true .

a half hour in the lobby .

now listen , arnold just said that he 's been making three million a movie now . but he 's not ever gon na change . he 's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie . he feels no different . he also bought a brand- new condo with maria , they gon na furnish tastefully .

okay .

they told me they 'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line .

i understand . i 'll go with you .

it 's been a while since you read the news -- i 'll have somebody work with you . just on superficial performance things .

please prepare carefully . this could n't come at a better time .

do one thing to me ? get me one shot at anchoring the weekend news -- they 've never seen me do it . i think it could turn them around .

wait . bullshit me a little ... i 'm beginning to appreciate it .

i do n't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you .

stop it .

we came from washington .

just a few questions ?

my gosh , and for a while there , i was attracted to you .

goodbye , paul .

oh , come on -- tell us another .

we have a minute and a half . it 's my responsibility to tell them we wo n't be ready .

if we 're not here for each other during the tough time , we 're not a news organization .

bill ... this is hard on all of us and it 's no time for compliments . but i think it 's extraordinary of you to come down here for this .

well , the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect .

well , darling , if it gets any better than that , i 'm going to have to bring you up here to new york .

they canned me . well , my brother will feel great -- now he 's not the only screw-up .

what are you dressed up for ? oh , that 's right -- because the evening news is here this week .

and bobbie says ...

yes , there is .

i 've got to tell ernie ... because there is n't enough time .

i 'll be right down . it 's right tight .

you know , i like tom , because hi ...

yes . you did n't have to come here . it 's just that i 'm going to anchor this special report on this libyan thing ...

okay . and look , in the future i can call you when i have news for you . do n't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information . well , that was n't as hard to say as you thought , was it , buddy ?

no . really ... do n't worry about it .

nobody else had it .

i see the change in you -- i see it .

thanks a lot , buddy .

my roommate 's very social -- somebody from justice was over and ... i always hear things before they happen . hey , and from now on , so do you .

yes , it 's true . they 're going to make it public wednesday but is n't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early ?

i really have to go .

i could use somebody to talk to on a day like this . sorry . go ahead .

jane -- for god 's sake ... look , it 's time for you to go to sleep .

i 'll just have to try harder . i do n't know . i will . i will . i will . i will .

proud ? i 'm just embarrassed that i like when they say those things .

no . but , honest . what are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks ? i do n't even know what they mean -- `` beat them off with a stick . ''

were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss ?

go ahead .

i do n't know .

i do n't know a recent saturday i 've sold more . you did n't think i 'd sell that health restaurant , did you ?

no , it 's awful . oh my , it 's awful .

it 's not opinion .

okay , that 's your opinion . i do n't agree .

so you have an extra bathing suit , huh ?

you keep coming after me and looking down on me . it 's starting to make me batty .

it 's amazing . you commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if i 'm nitpicking . try and get this . when you edited that ...

this is a one-way argument . we 've got six days ; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we 'll come home . if you do n't go ? well , that 's a much bigger deal . i go to london right after that . so , it 'd be very big deal if you stay here . the plane 's boarding . you 're good at deadline . here 's your ticket .

i got promoted for things like that .

i felt funny about it afterwards . it 's verboten , huh ? i thought since i did it for real the first time -- but i get you . that 's not the reason you 're not coming ?

you fucking ...

then give me a minute ...

no . did he really ?

okay , great , grunick -- easy shots now -- huh ? good night .

jane , i 'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule .

good night ? ? !

hello ?

hi , again . sorry about ...

do n't run off -- like everything 's settled the minute you make up your mind .

what happened ?

no . i 'll see you at your apartment as soon as i can .

right , right -- is n't she fun to tease ?

you okay ?

it 's incredible who 's here .

yeah .

no . were you going to you ?

no . are you going to the correspondents ' dinner on saturday ?

says who ? not important -- ha-ha-ha . i was dreaming -- oh , no -- ca n't tell -- how embarrassing for me . gosh .

i 'm not sure i dialed right -- jane ?

yes , tom -- i think i can manage .

eventually . does it have to be right now ?

it 's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you .

well , i thought i 'd check if all of you were still here . i 'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on .

excited .

you okay ?

you 're great at taking the edge off a good time .

well , thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you .

what do you mean clean ?

so he was indicted ?

no . aaron and i go to central america on wednesday -- so i 'm cramming .

i ca n't believe i 'm really here . no kidding . if you 're through work now --

you were n't . thanks . how does it feel being here ?

we 're working here ! ! you can stand over in the uh , uh , uh ...

they said it would be okay if ...

i never told you the reason i was telling you everything for .

just what do you want from me , anyway ? permission to be a fake ? stop whining and do something about it .

well , come on -- it is your life . nobody is tying you to the fast track . did you go to college ?

what about the obvious remedy ? reversing things . maybe getting a job on a newspaper .

i trust you .

how are you at back rubs ?

i was doing sports at the station . the newspaper ran this untrue story that i was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail . so they made me anchor .

that actually goes on ...

hi . i was worried i was early .

i just wanted to tell you how great you were . my name 's tom grunick .

right back to you .

this is very awkward .

i just need you for another minute now , so we can shoot from behind towards me , and , um ...

the way you were looking at me , i just went .

yes , i 'm sorry .

it 's just an innocent question . besides i just wanted to clarify your intentions .

you 're breaking my concentration !

not even a little bit ?

sit in this chair , and i 'll pose you .

shh !

what , right now ?

yes . fifty dollars an hour , right ?

i did n't finish talking to you !

what are you doing here ?

i 'd be glad to help . for $ 50 an hour .

see you later -

what did he do ?

everyone wants to meet the bus boy .

alright i got you , man . it 's my turn for freak patrol .

not really . one girl who fit the descrip came in , kinda skinny , brunette , did n't see much changing hands .

do n't you see carla ? i made them immortal .

there 's ... a body inside that statue !

would you really like to ? that would make me very happy .

i 'm sorry about what i said before .

why not ? !

carla -

of course i do !

oh , i do n't know . smart people . creative people i guess .

i know . but i wanted to talk to you .

oh yeah ?

carla ...

of course ... it 's wonderful .

do n't worry it 's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk .

what 's this sauce ! i 'm lactose intolerant .

here you go , enjoy .

would you pose for me for free ?

why not ?

oh come on ! even you can see its value .

do n't ask .

are you alright ?

are you trying to be funny ?

what are you doing here so early ?

oh yes ... very nice ... very , very nice ...

do you have to be so cold to him ?

that 's alright , we got a pressing engagement !

maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil . maybe he started taking it .

man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes , nudes , nudes ...

looks like that cat paid off in spades .

i do n't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid . it was out there ...

i know , man .

when carla comes by i 'll talk to her . she 'll make up some nice invitations . we 'll have them printed up .

well , w-what did you do ?

maxwell ! he 's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry ! listen , you 've got to stop right away ! i 'm beginning to feel responsible !

well why not ? i got ta make statues leonard . you heard maxwell , they want me to make them . i ca n't go back to being a busboy !

five .

buffy ...

you are such a wet .

you 'll get used to it . i 'm more worried about your tactical mistakes .

it 's natural . a reaction to their presence , to the ... unnaturalness of it . it 's part of how you are able to track them .

he was slow . very simple . they wo n't all be that easy .

oh .

they were vampires ?

if i say 'no ' does that make me a bad person ?

oh , several . lucretia borgia , joseph mengele , franklin pangborn ... are any of those names familiar ?

exactly . you 're changing . you 're becoming something extraordinarily powerful .

do n't you see what 's happening ? you 're changing . you 've got powers you 've only just begun to tap . physical , mental prowess you 've never dreamed of . god , this hurts . i 've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working . i 'm sorry i have to take so many shortcuts in the training process .

it was necessary .

i do n't want to be the chosen one , okay ? i do n't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires ! i just want to graduate from high school , go to europe , marry charlie sheen and die . it may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you , but i think it 's swell . and then you come along ... and ... and then i 'm a member of the hairy mole club , so you throw things at me !

and you caught it ! only the chosen one could have done that .

yes , yes . it would be interesting . a nice cheer .

here ?

i tell you , the best thing i can do right now is find out more about you . what your strengths are , your likes ... everything . what 's your best subject ?

what ?

yes . they travel about , usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork . the vampires find a community and they feed on it , make it their own . you were difficult to trace , and i think the process has gone a lot further than i 'd anticipated . usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy . but for some reason , nobody here seems to be paying any attention .

oh , him .

there 's a great deal i have to show you , i 'm not even sure where to start there 's so little time .

it 's true .

why did n't you ever tell anybody about your dreams ?

i have to show you .

oh , my god . i never told anybody about this . i remember the one about the peasant , too . god , there 's a bunch . is this , like channeling or something .

china .

in the past . a girl . maybe ... a magyar peasant . an indian princess . a slave .

does elvis talk to you ? tell you to do things ? do you see spots ?

yes .

time to do what ?

wait !

am i in trouble or something ?

what ? oh . i used to do gymnastics . are you looking for someone ?

sorry .

yeah , just make sure you do first . let 's go , guys .

i do n't get it .

that is so cool .

cool . we can figure decorations and stuff .

no thx .

you got a c-plus ? i ca n't believe i cheated off you .

really ?

are we so strange ? so alien to you ? i 've seen this culture , the wealth , the greed , the waste ... it 's truly heartwarming . the perfect place to spread my empire . honestly , eastern europe was so dead , the communists just drained the blood out of the place . it 's livened up a bit in the past few years , but it 's nothing compared to this ... . this mecca of consumption . the city of angels .

my parents have money ...

ever since adam and eve first left the garden , he followed : the serpent . satan . he sends his legion in the shape of men , to feed on us , to breed his hell on our earth . they are a plague upon us .

the mark of the coven .

she has died . you are the next to be called . why do you think you were sent to me ? trained as you were ? you bear the mark .

what are you grinning at ? you think i was scared ?

i heard she got straight a 's .

no --

make me a woman ! yes ! make me a woman !

probably was . what do you suppose she was doing out there .

i ca n't believe they still ate it .

i never thought of that .

well , that 's the thing . she landed on her feet . did n't even sprain a toe . and i go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she 's like this --

buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good ; coach said she could have been in the olympics -- but she was doing a routine , spinning , and the beam broke .

the do n't . you kind of wish they would , though .

it 's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch .

right .

like you 've got a grip .

hey . what should i do if i see benny ?

i am .

where am i gon na find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money ?

what nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going ?

how can i possibly thank you ?

yeah , skip , it 's me . jeez ... jeez ... god ... jeez ...

-- but you 're father 's in there !

he said if i gave in to you i 'd start losing again .

what 'd he say ?

fundamentals ?

no , no , it was great .

i 'm so proud of you and all the guys . want some more soup ?

just till i lose .

i 'm yours .

yes . and so is birth . now look me in the eyes , nuke -- you have n't been wearing my panties , have you ?

god ... i think i 'm gon na be sick --

how ya like that ?

he 's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six .

you 're patronizing me ! i will not be patronized --

right . okay , fire a couple in there .

the ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril .

you 've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain . these 'll help move things to the right side .

you said `` crash '' .

five hours . we both just know . do you think i deserve to wear white ?

no , no -- i 'm fine . millie , how much time did you and jimmy spend together before he proposed ?

you should be at the game .

well , he fucks like he pitches . sorta all over the place

-- millie , you 've got to stay out of the clubhouse . it 'll just get everybody in trouble .

you think i could make it to the show as a manager ?

not yet . it takes years of practice ...

yeah ... you a witch ?

there might be an opening for a manager at salem next spring .

i got released .

why not ?

i do n't know if i 'd go that far .

i crossed the street -- it was the new york yankees spring training field -- tok , tok , tok , was the sound of a ball hitting a bat -- and i sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother ... and i saw him .

i was raised in a baptist church got dipped in the water when i was 5 -- born again before kindergarten ... by the time i was 10 i knew it was bullshit and at 15 i ran away from home ...

why baseball ?

god damn you -- what is happening ? is there no man who 'll have me ? this is the weirdest season i ever saw -- the durham bulls ca n't lose and i ca n't get laid !

annie , i think you should leave .

-- and as soon as we lose a game , he 'll be back in your arms .

i do n't imagine there 's much i could teach you .

and he 's right ! a ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak . they do n't happen very often . you know how hard this game is ? if you believe you 're playing well because you 're getting laid or because you 're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties -- then you are ! and i still think thomas pynchon is full of shit .

i think of you and the `` boy '' all the time .

i 'm not a real batter . i 'm a woman .

a batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing --

fact is you 're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause it might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around -- great deal . you get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing- so what do you really want ? you wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic ? or do you want a guy ?

do n't tell anybody .

that 's my job too .

what'you see in that guy -- he 's dim , pretty boy . a young , wild ,

i think thomas pynchon 's a genius .

i 'm not interested yet .

why do you get to choose ? why do n't i get to choose ?

she 's dancing with me .

i do n't trust a man who do n't dance . it ai n't natural .

he 'll learn .

he looks wonderful , jackson ...

that 's not necessary , jackson -- - okay , nuke , now lean in for the sign .

we were worried that ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball -- we 're so pleased , he met a christian woman .

we gon na fuck or what ?

well , he sort of pitches for the cosmic all-stars .

who 's he play for ?

the socks ? it 's cold in here .

well -- you boys stopped fighting yet ? are you pals now ? good . i love a little macho male bonding -- i think it 's sweet even if it 's probably latent homosexuality being `` re-channeled '' but i believe in `` re-channeling '' so who cares , right ? shall we go to my place ?

you need a nickname .

you want me to call you a cocksucker ? !

you 're in the wrong business , jack -- you 're sears-roebuck material !

did you call me a cocksucker ?

it 's the best , nuke ... the absolute fucking best .

well , i got annie all warmed up for ya ... she 's just waiting for you to show up , y'know ...

fear and ignorance .

i have been known , on occasion , to howl at the moon . d'you understand that ?

if ya get in a fight with some asshole , never hit his with your pitching hand . ya might get injured . that 's another lesson for ya -- now quit fucking around and help me up .

my right .

you know what the difference is between hitting .250 and hitting .300 ? 1 got it figured out . twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points . okay ? there 's 6 months in a season , that 's about 25 weeks -- you get one extra flare a week -- just one -- a gork , a ground ball with eyes , a dying quail -- just one more dying quail a week and you 're in yankee stadium !

no .

you fuck !

hey , guys , i got a game to pitch .

i 'm nervous -- my old man 's here .

you outta your mind ? if you give in now you might start losing . never fuck with a winning streak .

`` ... good lord willing , things 'll work out . ''

jesus .

of course . that 's the point . `` i 'm just happy to be here and hope i can help the ballclub . ''

you 're the boss .

the moment 's over . if this guy starts me off with a breaking ball , i 'm going downtown --

your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging -- in the show they woulda ripped you .

i was playing naked .

party without me .

`` naw '' ? there 's ice skaters coming ! you ever made love to an ice skater ?

oh she may get wooly , women do get wooly , because of all the stress ...

guy hit the shit outta that one , eh ?

fastball .

but he ai n't seen my heat --

shake off the pitch . throw what you wanta .

and where can i go ?

i 'm too old for this shit . why the hell am i back in `` a '' ball ?

crash davis ?

step outside , pal .

dad -- if my curveball is hanging , god ai n't gon na help me .

no . if i screw up , i wanta do it alone . i 'll call .

i was thinking i could fly up and spend a week in the big leagues with you -- help you get comfortable .

the organization wants to make a change ... now that nuke 's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher ...

it 's a damn convention .

okay ...

look , guys -- i 'm a man , i got needs too . i understand this party -- but ... sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything i know . there 's a baseball lesson in there somewhere . where 's crash ?

it 's a miracle .

even if it 's the carolina league -- this is a chance to play everyday .

sears sucks , crash , i tried it once . sold lady kenmores -- it 's nasty , nasty work .

i 'm joe riggins . sit down

your breaking ball 's getting better but ya need a change up .

ai n't here .

looking for crash davis .

where does he go ?

crash ai n't there . he never gets back till four or five --

what ?

phil , i can understand . you 're in the finances , you 're upstairs , but you are not on the floor . i got thousands of players . i got five hundred dealers . they 're all lookin ' to rob me blind , twenty-four hours a day . i have to let them know i 'm watching all the details , all the time ; that there is not one single thing i will not catch as i am over here .

i mean , the guy is history as far as i 'm concerned . history .

was i at that dinner ?

the only time i was at the tangiers was when i had dinner with barney greenstein .

he 's lying .

i never comped you ? ! i do n't comp you at least two or three times a month at the tangiers ? !

that 's right .

hey , i need a room . need a room .

i would forget about the maneuver . i would just get out .

the old man said , 'maybe your friend should give in . ' and when the old man says 'maybe ' , that 's like a papal bull . not only should you quit , you should run !

philip , if you would rise .

okay , randy . thank you .

congratulations .

no , you 're not calm .

jesus christ ! what gun ? he 's got a fuckin ' hero sandwich here .

... been right , but who knows ?

excuse me .

you got it . schmuck . all right . i just bought us a few minutes . want to get back at this prick ?

right back .

so , l-l-l-listen , i te- i te- i tell you - can i call you back in a few minutes ?

... rothstein . i want to talk to ginger . put her on the phone .

hello .

she 's my wife . look at me . you did know that , did n't you ? you knew that she 's my wife ? huh ? hey , look at me .

sam , let me ask you a question . you must really trust your wife .

so , once she signs those papers , she 'll be the only person to have total access to the box ? no one else , including myself ?

now this is just a signature card .

ohhh ...

i do n't know .

when did this happen , honey ?

wh-wh -

help , daddy !

okay .

hey , be fuckin ' nice . calm . be nice . do n't fuck up in here .

she did n't know who to turn to . she ... she did n't know where to turn . she was tryin ' to save your marriage .

ace do n't ... listen , do n't ... do n't make a scene , all right ?

how 'd you know i was here ?

no , i 'm not okay .

nick ?

it 's me .

sammy .

hello .

yeah .

you never - ?

back - back up , back up a fuckin ' minute here . one minute . i asked you ? ! when the fuck did i ever ask you if i could come out here ? ! get this through your head , you -

oh , sure . now you want to blame your fuckin ' license on me , is that it ?

me ? ! i would n't even be in this situation if it was n't for you . you brought down so much fuckin ' heat on me . i mean , every time i meet somebody here , the big question is do i know you .

yeah , i did want to go on tv . that way i have a forum . i can fight back . i 'm known . people see me . they know they ca n't fuck around with me like they could if i was an unknown . that 's right .

i 'm what counts out here ! not your fuckin ' country clubs or your fuckin ' tv shows ! and what the fuck are you doin ' on tv anyhow ? !

i did n't do anything . i mean , i did n't order you or anybody ... i only told andy stone that you had a lot of heat on you , and that was a problem .

yeah .

and at the ...

fuckin ' walking around with a big head . you better check yourself ...

a week ago it was my business , now it 's none of my business . in other words , when you need me to take care of somethin ' for you , then you need me .

okay ?

... do n't do it to me ...

please ...

now , what does she have to do with all this ?

my wife ?

you know , i did n't want to bring this up , but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect . even your own wife .

yeah .

all right .

yes , you lost your control .

i lost control ?

looks bad ? i 'm gon na tell you what looks bad .

yeah , that 's out of context . okay .

you should say so .

hey , rich .

let 's say ... for instance ... i want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino ... to get one of those sandwiches i like ?

motherfucker . unsavory fuckin ' ... is there any way around this ?

that black book is a bunch of bullshit . they got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still al capone .

you better watch yourself . there 's a lot of heat on you already .

but i 'll tell you , he knew how to bring in the crowds . he knew all the fuckin ' angles . he brought over the whole 'femme fatale ' show from paris . but he forgot how lazy them european dancin ' broads can get . i mean , he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they did n't blow up like fuckin ' balloons .

okay .

i 'm sorry about this . really .

then he called me a faggot .

... and he tells me to go fuck myself .

so , i 'm lucky . i 'm not allowed to get lucky in this place ?

i mean , nicky 's a made guy and i 'm not . i ca n't do that .

it was so obvious . i mean , all of nicky 's half-assed mechanics , they were real signal happy .

especially at the casino , where he definitely did not work , people got the message .

ohh !

but i saw it another . i saw it as untouched . i mean , they had bookies , pimps and drug dealers i could shake down . who the fuck were they gon na run to ? so , i started getting everybody in line . best of all , for the first time in my life , i figured out a way not to lose .

nick , i got ta tell you , i got pinched twice for no reason . you really got ta be careful . i 'm running a licensed place . everything 's legit .

sure , you have my permission . but i - i just got ta tell you it 's no joke out here . it 's no joke , you know ? you got ta keep a low profile . it 's not like back home . right off the bat , they do n't like guys like us . and this sheriff 's a real cowboy . even the coppers are n't afraid to bury people out in the desert here .

no , of course not .

after we ate , we left jennifer and ginger alone and we took a ride to talk . and then ... he hit me with it .

okay , sammy .

while i was tryin ' to figure out why the guy was sayin ' what he was sayin ' , nicky just hit him . no matter how big a guy might be , nicky would take him on . you beat nicky with fists , he comes back with a bat . you beat him with a knife , he comes back with a gun . and you beat him with a gun , you better kill him , because he 'll keep comin ' back and back until one of you is dead .

wait a sec , nicky , nicky , nicky . ta- take it easy .

what 's that ? you hear ? you hear a little girl , frankie ? you hear a little girl , ace ? is that a little fuckin ' girl ? ! what happened to the fuckin ' tough guy ? told my friend stick it up his fuckin ' ass ? ! huh ? ! huh ? !

it was eight . ace ... tell him the line on the bear 's game .

you know , havin ' some fun with it , shit like that .

you know , i do n't know if i could do this even if i wanted to . the gaming commission would never give me a license . i have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me .

well , could there be any position ... further down the trough ?

believe me , if i could prove it , he would be under arrest .

uh , i come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter . see , uh , maybe you did n't know it , but , uh , don ward is a very well-liked man in this town . he 's got lots of friends here . now , his family and their money go back many , many years . now , friends vote ... family and money votes . that 's important to me ... and you . and if you 'll think about our little problem along them lines ... and you forgive me for sayin ' it , maybe he did not deserve to be fired .

seven o'clock ?

you see ? never tells me nothin ' . ace , what do we got on for next week ?

next morning bright and early , i get the call .

let 's go to lunch . do you want to go to the riviera ?

you go and put your things away .

they were ready to blame him for anything , no matter where it happened .

yeah , refill 'd be great .

mr rothstein ... well , sometimes , when you reach that pressure point , when you put that pressure point on them , you know , it shows ...

i ...

okay . just take it easy .

i do n't care what she is . she 's an institution , that 's the problem . she 's lazy .

certainly . senator .

we ca n't get rid of him ?

i 'm afraid to let her in the house .

just wait there for me !

she , she 's alone . just go . take the gun and go into amy 's .

get the fu- you threatening me ? i 'll fuckin ' kill you in this place ! get up and go home right now .

i want you to let me go .

i mean , you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin ' door ? are ...

i mean , it could get us both killed .

who were you with ?

i had a ... salad .

what 'd you have ?

with jennifer .

i put her to bed .

you threw it away ?

you 're stoned . you 're a junkie . get out of here .

stop ! you are n't getting rid of me with one fuckin ' suitcase !

i 'm going to the bank and i 'm getting my jewelry too !

i 'll go , but i want my money right now !

but even if you bought him a watch , a really nice watch , one that he thought was nice - and he does n't know what the fuck a good watch is - so , you go , five , ten , twelve grand ?

yeah .

i bought him a watch too .

the good part was , i had amy back . so , we went home , had the housekeeper stay over , put the kid to bed , i calmed myself down and we went to dinner . i tried to keep things nice and civil , you know . but ... hey , twenty-five thousand for three suits ? that does n't make much sense .

all right ...

pretty serious .

i got ta tell ya ...

right .

... please . that 's all i 'm askin ' you .

hi , it 's me . just who you wanted to talk to , right ?

yeah , and i get a sprained fuckin ' elbow .

how could you say that ? you 're a beautiful woman . you 're destroying yourself . you do n't need that stuff . you do n't need that fuckin ' leech livin ' off you . i know you better than you know yourself . you 're a tiger , you 're stronger than i am . and when you set your mind on doing something , you do it better than anybody . you can do it . you can do it .

that 's all you care about . you do n't care about me at all .

you understand ? your drinking 's gettin ' way out of hand . i 'm gon na get you into a program . they got plenty of good ones .

yeah , how do i know ?

okay ? and you 're embarrassing me . why do want to make me feel so bad ?

well , i mean ... you know , i got ta ask you . that 's a lot of money . you 're not asking for a box of popcorn , you know . i mean ...

you get her ? okay . well , i need a lot . i need more than usual .

oh , fabulous .

yeah . yeah .

you sure ?

right ?

you 're with me now .

yeah .

understand ? i 'm sorry .

yeah , i know all that .

you got the wrong girl , sam .

the ginger i knew would n't even look at this creep .

hello .

ginger 's mission in life was money .

... twenty years in order to find nothin ' on me -

bullshit ! bullshit !

good evening , everyone , i 'm paige novodor . what should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant tangiers casino executive , sam

that 's amazing .

how many kids do you have ?

i really think you 're -

well , it 's a casino . people got ta win sometimes .

well , there 's no way to determine that , sam .

you did n't see the scam ? you did n't see what was goin ' on ?

shoot , it 's got ta be in the millions , maybe more .

the action is in the front , not in the back . bring 'em up front .

well , that 's all i ask , gentlemen , a fair hearing .

is this yours ? your pen ?

i 'm sorry . i made a bad mistake .

and do n't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here . you understand ?

fuckin ' kids at home ! here . get the fuck out of here .

hey ... you got a minute ? hey . he 's got two million in the box , am i right ? okay , you let him keep your jewels . we take the cash and the only other thing he cares about . huh ? her majesty . we go to europe . you dye your hair , get some pl-

you 're goin ' out to las vegas , you 're havin ' a good time at my expense . what the fuck ? i mean , after all , you 're the one having a good time , not me .

well , then , from now on , i 'm gon na start keepin ' records .

come on , go back there ? i never got paid my expenses for the last trip .

i was out there with my cumma [ italian- american slang for 'girlfriend ' . ]

hey , you fat irish prick . you put my fuckin ' money to sleep . you go get my money , or i 'll put your fuckin ' brain to sleep .

yeah , least you could do is return my phone calls , though .

hi . good .

no , i do n't want one . hey , mr clark , how you doin ' ?

jeff , would you go in with her ?

fucker !

he wo n't let me go in my house !

mr rothstein , why do n't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things ? that way she 'll get out of here . this is half her house anyway .

all right . okay , okay .

... fuckin ' jerk-off .

leave me alone !

now move along .

i think , you know , maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin ' . i do n't know .

stay out of the way !

no , i wo n't calm down ! he 's my husband !

calm down ! calm down !

we 're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -

frankie , i want to ask you something .

is that what you want ?

i need some help . i do . i need some help . you got ta help me . i need a new sponsor , nicky .

come on . do n't be scared .

exactly . he hates me .

he really thinks who the fuck he is , i 'll tell you that .

everything went to his head .

you did . i like that . i like that . that 's what i like about you . you did the right thing .

you did . you 're right .

i did n't . i did n't . i mean , i did , but then i did exactly what you told me to do , and i came right back .

yeah . 'cause , you know , he 's never gon na give me my jewelry .

well , i was thinkin ' , maybe ... you know somebody at the bank ... could help me get my jewelry out ? there 's a lot of money in there . lot of money in there , and i 'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out .

nothin ' .

what ? what ?

it 's all right .

thank you .

and take it easy with this shit , will you ? i mean , this can only make matters worse .

i 'm told it 's worth about a million dollars , maybe more .

mm , you want to steal it ?

oh , come on . i went into this with my eyes open , you know . i knew the bottom could drop out at any time . i 'm a working girl , right ? you do n't think i 'm gon na go into a situation like this if i do n't think i 'm gon na get covered on the back end .

i never see - you know , i never seen him act like that with anybody else . i think he 's crazy about you . i mean , he really loves you . he does .

i told him i was mrs sam rothstein .

ginger , i 've been watching you all night . you 've been stealing from me .

'go ! go ! go ! '

you 're gon na fuckin ' kill her . take it easy .

get out . get out ! get out !

whoa . calm down .

calm down , calm down . shh !

did i say to do anything yet ? i said i 'm not sure ... i 'll let you know . i want to think about it . where 're these pricks at ?

and when i 'm ready , i 'll say the words , 'go see the jew . '

yeah , but i 'm not sure yet .

who 's this guy ? who 's this guy ?

yeah , what 's to stop him ?

walk , walk , walk . what 'd you say ?

he asked me again about you and the jew 's wife .

you must have drunk too much .

sue me , you jew fuck !

so are we .

mm .

it 's up to you .

but , hey , what do they care , as long as i keep sendin ' money back .

i mean , the cops knew , but they did n't give a fuck . i mean , you know , they all worked it out together .

... remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions .

and this is stacy .

hey , shelly .

i actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where i kept the choice stuff .

get up .

of course .

hold it , hold it . here .

whoa , whoa , whoa .

charlie m .

my fuckin ' head .

i 'm sorry , nicky . i did n't mean anything by it .

you 're a little confused ?

i 'm positive .

... this , uh , this commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the rothstein application .

you 'll get a heart attack like that .

i know , but that 's enough .

that 's enough .

i did n't curse . i said 'frickin ' head ' .

oh , sorry -

ayy ! some cat 's blocking the periscope . somebody , give it a swat ...

it 's okay . let her go .

you have to dial nine first .

do i have to remind everyone that in two days , we 'll all be dead . the cult of good will be a memory . i do n't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals . we have a secret mission ...

oops -- my face must match my cape . and to think we were going to let you go ...

in many ways , that obnoxious creep cactus was the worst one of all . he got off on giving out pain ...

you 're serious ? you 'd help me ...

this ring belonged to my sister . i 'd love for you to ...

i still ca n't get over it . i still ca n't believe you 're catwoman..

hmm . not bad .

i 'm sure .

your warehouse ? go on ahead -- to your `` warehouse . '' i 'll be okay ...

well , it 's just that i would think that the woman who is the real , non- imitation catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea . really angry .

what little boy does n't ... my god ... it 's , it 's ... catwoman .

so , did you see `` seinfeld '' last week ? that kramer-guy really makes me laugh .

how heroic of you ...

nothing , just a jolt of deja-vu . i think i went out with a guy with a dignified british butler -- ca n't remember how it turned out..

what 's the matter ...

i do n't know . i ca n't remember .

i 'll bet . funny , for some reason , i do n't think dogs are supposed to like me .

in women ?

but then we knew that all along , did n't we ...

i 've been looking for you . selina kyle was right . one of us is a psychotic crusader .

i 've been looking for you .

you 're kidding .

wha-at ?

hey , speaking of wrong place , wrong time . lewis lane to the rescue !

the `` skylight ? '' fool ! it 's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight ...

will you please stop fighting ? just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together ! trust me , one day we 'll look back on this day and laugh . you got to admit , it 's a lot more fun to be the villain .

you were right all along -- the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie . i was making good money as a top architect -- but that 's not who i am . i 'm not an architect , i 'm a..

i 've been thinking . i 've been thinking about us . i 'm sorry i 've been so hard no you these past couple days . i realize now it 's because you 're the only woman who ever understood me and i could n't handle it ! i 've never revealed myself to anyone the way i have to you . let 's blow this town together . we 'll run a bed-and-breakfast in vermont by day , and by night , we 'll dress up and kill anything that ...

what do you want from me ?

yeah , this is better than rape .

resting up ? sorry spooky , i 've got to go with god on this one . i hate to think we 're just in this for the money . garfield 's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she 's got to get spayed . we 're going out of oasisburg on a win .

`` dat 's got ta hurt ! ''

i hate innocent bystanders . whine , whine , whine . will he settle ?

absolutely .

car wash , captain ?

i got her ...

quite a little performance you gave in the casino today -- for me and that other guy . come on down , let 's chat..

that is not a man , captain god . that is vomit accidentally born with two legs .

`` well done , '' cactus .

i know .

what 's the matter with you , spooky , my most trusted comrade ? we are warriors ! these are the challenges we live for !

you like them , do n't you , boss .

do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid ? zilcho . urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law . not exactly the stuff of a w-2 form . if it was n't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical `` missions '' ... there is no such thing as heroes and villains , anymore , selina . there are only winners and losers . you lost . we won .

i know , i should probably tell you , but i just do n't feel like it . to be honest , i 'm really angry at you . i admired you so much more when you were purely wicked . i mean , look at you now , running around trying to `` get to the bottom '' of things . trying to `` save the city . '' it 's true we 're about to do a very nasty deed , but really , what 's it to you ? since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic oasiburgians ? you 're just not yourself , anymore .

you 've seen me ...

a superhero 's job is to protect society . do n't blame me if society is a horrible , corrupt joke .

has n't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing .

you know , my name 's not spooky . it 's , it 's rachel .

oh no , not a computer disc . a computer disc ? oh man , come on , what do i look like ? i 'm not a crime- fighter , i 'm not a detective , what , i 'm supposed to find some `` clues '' on this disc . i ca n't ...

for when the..uh , yeah , thanks , a little gold piece of ... gold . uh ...

whatever you say ... sis .

spooky .

oh frank , i 'm not anti-male , i 'm anti- you . believe me , there 's a difference . kelly is designing new uniforms for next week . pay her and thank her . and is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning . there 's something out there called 73 degrees , look into it .

hey , you 're anti-male .

yeah , as in born before..ooh , i suppose it 's `` sexual harassment '' to give a woman a compliment . sheesh . come on , gentleman ...

you 're late . i 've got some good news and some good news . i 'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in .

i 'll let you know .

okay . let 's get serious . of course i know the cult of good is not good . ever since i saw what they did in atlanta , it has been my mission to expose them . i 've followed them to oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice . that computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle . this is n't just a story , selina -- another damn pulitzer -- this is my life .

not too cool ...

you ca n't figure me out . you 're the strange one..

i said i saw you last night . what were you doing hiding in that alley , running off when the superhero alarm sounded ...

i 'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning -- what did you say ?

like you do n't know ...

what ?

i thought you 'd like a ride to work . you do n't own a cat , do you ?

ah ! you scared me ! how did you know to come here ! have you been spying..

but of course you are .

most articles focus on the first half of her name -- describing some feline monster . i want the woman of catwoman . after all , if it was a man dressed as a cat , the story would be on page 23 -- just another loony . oh , i want this one . i want her bad..

yeah , she 's okay .

a genuine woman of mystery in oasisburg . amnesia . bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up . beautiful , intelligent eyes that have no business in `` frank 's fun palace '' or anybody else 's fun palace for that matter..

it 's seeing-eye dogs , ma'am . if i let the cat stay , will you go out with me ?

i 'm sorry , ma'am , there are no pets allowed in the library ...

trust me , you wo n't have to .

what kind of name is `` brock leviathan ? ''

it 's because i did n't come in . i live in the hut , now . i meant to tell you..see ya .

where were you last night ? i did n't hear you come in .

uh , it 's just -- that woman out there -- that horrible hag . she 's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter -- and now she 's built a hut in the back..why did you ...

i 'll take your abuse , but it 's way too early for the sanctimonious cult of gag ...

is every single thing out of your mouth since your `` accident '' have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm ?

oh mommy , you 're embarrassing me .

you 're the one . i thought i told you to stay hidden behind the couch , cat ! you 've torn the unit apart . you 've driven a great leader insane ...

you seem sad , spooky .

oh pooh , come now . if you turn me down , i just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..

i do n't see anybody in there but you .

i know . but it 's an emergency . somebody dying . okay ?

this is one way .

taking messages .

do i hear a woman 's voice ?

was someone in an accident ?

what if they do question the authenticity ?

that 's all we need . better let me drive .

he 's right , theo . she might not be around to back up your story . you could end up in the middle of this .

will you two cut it out ?

you could n't hurt me . but it 's the principle .

who 's on the phone ?

i told you i should 've cuffed him .

bear right till the fire road ends . it 's not far .

how do we get back to the freeway ?

you missed .

yes sir .

lady , do n't let him do it !

you never miss a trick .

now turn around . i 'm going to cuff you .

so theo and nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed . a thing of beauty . jesus , the shit you come up with !

i prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location . once nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies .

okay , okay , lenore , calm down . either let me call the school or better yet , the f.b.i .

satisfied , wiseass ?

first off , this mr. chow yen does n't speak a lot of english . the girl with him will interpret . there will be a third person to accompany you into the men 's room where you can take count . i hope you know krugerands better than they know a < u > hockney < /u > .

what do you mean tip the cops ? is the man a lunatic or what ?

bullshit .

that was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked . i heard you were a hitter .

he took it like a man . toss him in that drainage ditch .

-- the phones , theo . do n't leave any of them behind . the cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you .

know what else is in here ?

i 'm handling it .

i 'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house . it may take awhile but you 'll be found after we 're long gone .

which one of us is elected to do the deed ?

how about `` later ? ''

we had a backup plan . but i knew you 'd come through for me .

as a child i hated being told how sweet i looked . that angelic little face was n't me at all . i had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image . sometimes words were enough -- but i was n't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously . i enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who i was . that same look you gave me when i turned the gun on you .

who 'd ever think , to look at you ?

they did some great job of reforming you .

i was sentenced to a youth camp out here when i was fourteen . we cleared some of these same roads .

259-7881 .

did you hear that ?

stop talking like that !

i guess i ought to stop seeing woman as victims .

i knew you were a loser the first night i laid eyes on you .

a typical fuck-up .

shit . you could n't be in much worse shape .

you knew about me .

they always pick rachel up early on thursday .

you timed that beautifully .

at least one .

whose money is this ?

there is n't any such person .

you 're not lenore oberfeld .

the rest of the money is here in the car . why do n't you come and get it ?

we 've almost got your husband and your daughter out . so do n't get any ideas .

you 're going to let them get away with this ?

why did n't you just shoot them ?

rachel was terrified when i left her . i could see it in her eyes .

just start walking . come on . walk to me .

why ca n't it be her ?

they wo n't allow that . it 's one at a time . and you have to be first .

put the man back on .

yes .

thank you . god bless you for helping us .

they 're tied with duct tape so they ca n't speak -- but they seem to be --

yes ? yes ?

no . i hear them . they 're coming upstairs . they know !

downstairs . there must be an extension . oh my god --

or somebody else there is listening in --

did you jiggle the phone ?

why tell me this ?

if it 's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants . tufts , you know . it still has n't grown fully in . the other one is from the islands . braided hair -- very dark .

oh my god . i heard her scream again . what are they doing to her ? why ca n't i do anything to stop them ?

jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago .

they 'll recognize it 's not your husband .

i 'm not supposed to -- but i do . millions in cash and bearer bonds .

do you know what 's in that box ?

which means you ca n't be more than five or ten minutes from here .

when jack sees they 've got rachel he 'll tell them what they want to know .

what 's happening ?

does she wear glasses ?

that 's not her .

does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail ?

great . stay with me . there must be a hundred kids out here .

you 're breaking up . i ca n't hear you . theo ?

that makes two of us .

i 'm afraid if i stop talking i 'll lose you . just name any reasonable amount and it 's yours .

pictures .

our house always needs touching up .

and that was the end of it ?

they say she resembles me -- dark hair , ponytail , very dark eyes . they all wear the same uniform . please . be careful . the man driving the car must have a gun .

what do you think i 'm doing ? i 'm on my way to the school like you wanted .

what are you doing now ?

why is n't anyone answering me ?

they do n't know you . they wo n't listen .

then they took the mercedes away -- with his body in it .

who ?

he pulled us over as we left the riviera tennis club . claimed we 'd run a stop sign . and when elliot was reaching for his license --

one of them < u > is < /u > a cop .

okay . the police are gon na need your full name and address .

where 'd they take you to ?

they tortured my husband . made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts . once they get what 's in the safe deposit box they 'll kill us .

why would anybody want to hurt you ?

then hang up ! do it !

they gave me pills to make me sleep . they did n't realize how much seconal i 'm used to -- that i 'd have so much tolerance --

they 're holding my husband downstairs .

they smashed the phone . i 've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it 'd make a connection .

what 'd you do ! just pick my number out of the air ?

i 've been trying to get someone -- anyone . for hours ...

do n't leave me here to die -- theo , please -- you ca n't let me die --

who is this ?

i 'm opening the side door . she 'll step out . but before she gets in your vehicle i want to see the first installment put down in plain view . if it is n't there i 'm shooting her in the back .

and then ?

negative .

thanks for the sound advice . now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here . alone .

it 's in the process .

then just wait . i 'm counting this all out and deducting my share . while i 'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady . and her little girl .

you already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it did n't work .

fucking `` a '' it is ! any argument and i 'm out of here .

i do n't want you within two hundred feet . park down by the lifeguard station . nobody gets out .

got a phone in that van ?

tell the lady to relax . tell her i ca n't wait to meet her in person .

i want you all in one vehicle . your van . if i see anybody else cruising around i 'll keep going . no second chances . you can kill them and i 'll keep what i 've got .

where do we meet ?

following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend .

brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away . in which case you just warned them .

them . they wo n't be expecting us .

none of your business , but it 's in the cab . that 's all mine . when we take from them , we divide , eighty-twenty .

where 's the backpack ?

i 've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards .

take the 405 south .

not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds . i may need to pry that information out of her . what do you stand to gain ?

that bitch . what 's keeping you from taking off ?

why would she want me to think you were on ice ?

you could n't be calling at a worse time , nels .

from what i can see you 're a pretty fair wheelman . there 's a hairpin coming up -- that 's the place for it . the cops 'll plow right into you .

tailgate me . i 'll jam on the brakes . you go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off .

the fuck i will !

if you 're looking for a quickie all you 've got to do is ask .

tell the truth , i was going to take a much needed leak .

mind if i have a look ?

who are you ?

you sure know how to take a lot of punishment .

i thought so .

can i make a quick call ?

does n't everybody ?

when a girl runs out like that , she generally wants to be followed .

how ?

who knows the secrets of the human heart .

then why does n't she ?

it takes all types .

thanks .

is that good or bad ?

yeah . fuck it , dil .

hi .

ask him yourself .

ask him .

good thing in a man .

she wants to know , sir , do you like your hair .

saw that one .

he gave me a look .

see that , col ?

look , i 'm sorry .

do n't chuck my clothes out !

fuck off back to essex !

do n't throw my clothes out the window !

please , dil --

it 's dave .

cunt .

he 's going to take his foot off slowly , david . then you 're to go home , like a good boy . you hear me ?

see , they get the wrong idea .

do n't be like that --

it 's a simple question .

she 's not that either .

he wants to know do i mean that .

sorry wo n't bring the bloody thing back , will it , mr. franknum ?

please , dil --

fergus . fergus my love , light of my life - -

fergus .

i 'm sorry , darling . i keep forgetting the leap year . what am i supposed to call you then , jimmy ?

stop it , dil --

where am i to go , jimmy ?

ca n't remember ...

yes .

dil ! ! !

it 's my name , dil --

i know you 're lying , jimmy , but it 's nice to hear it .

you do ?

yes .

love me .

you like me now , jimmy ?

let them come then .

try and go , then .

let me go , dil

wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look .

do n't leave me tonight . might kill me , too .

no .

you killed my jody ?

i will be .

what condition ?

yes .

you got to forget you ever saw me , dil .

i was trying to get out of something .

i had to go to work !

thought you was fooling me . thought you was leaving me .

for you ...

why ?

yes .

i promise .

no .

and you would n't leave me ?

why ?

a girl has to draw the line somewhere --

you said anything , dil

no . sit down .

you got the keys to the shop ?

afraid so .

do you like me even a little bit ?

i ca n't .

and you 're not going to tell me more ?

i 'm sorry , you know that ? i 'm really sorry .

come on .

okay .

only if you kiss me .

you can always pretend .

thing is , dil , you 're not a girl .

ask to meet me again .

i know that .

i did n't mean to hit you .

nothing 's wise .

ask me to meet you again , jimmy .

yeah . i care , dil .

do you care , jimmy ?

apologies , my sweet .

what you doing here ?

did he ever tell you you were beautiful ?

i 'm thinking of your man .

no , depends on nothing .

the thing is , can you go the distance ?

aha .

drink .

something i heard someone say once .

so what do you want with me , jimmy ?

maybe .

should n't you be in mourning ?

but you can t stay , you know that ?

you say that like a gentleman .

maybe .

you want to know how i kissed him ?

how different ?

sorry . how 'd he drive with his neck in a brace ?

the things a girl has to put up with .

jesus .

you want one ?

make a pass or something . is n't that the way it goes ?

i wonder .

they 're jealous .

what 's that about ?

half-five . at millie 's .

where ?

now , if you asked me to meet you tomorrow , it would really drive him insane .

but i 'm not cheap , you know that ? loud , but never cheap .

he 's getting up .

perform ?

hi .

must be .

tell her i 'm very happy with it .

that should make her happy .

and what 's it like ?

you american ?

guy i work with .

need to lose myself awhile .

you 're back in the pink , tommy ? how 're you keeping ?

yes ?

stay late at your work tomorrow night and i 'll bring you the gear .

you may be right .

you know what . go .

aye . then we 'll leave her be .

so i suppose a fuck is out of the question . keep your head down , fergus . no sudden moves . and not a whisper to her . you 'll be hearing from us .

no way , jude . i 'm out .

we 've got some plans here . and we 'll need a mister nobody to execute them .

he ran . i could n't shoot him in the back . i tried to catch him . he made it to the road and got hit by a saracen .

i heard .

fucking do . i had him all over me .

you do n't know that .

has n't moved for twelve hours . go on . have a heart .

right .

hope not .

does n't matter who he is . he is what we would call a legitimate target .

a hotel ?

so what do you think that is , hennessy ?

definitely unusual .

i know that .

should blow you away , you know that ?

he 's at home .

who 'd you think it was ?

you ok about that ?

what the fuck is this ?

do you want a cup of tea ?

what ?

faster than cricket ?

stop that talk now --

nothing .

like the one about the frog ?

do n't know her .

that you guys should n't be here .

we do n't look on it like that .

but you fellas never get a break , do you ?

the best .

like having a pint in the metro --

like what ?

you lack imagination , fergus . think of something more alluring .

where would you most like to be now , man ?

do n't be so sure .

i 'm sorry . did n't mean to offend you , fergus .

shut up , would you ?

thank you . i had a case of the clap two years ago . crabs in ulster . but all in all it 's served me well .

toffs ' game there . but not at home . .

that game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other ?

ever see hurling ?

best game in the world .

it was a job . so i get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face .

you could have said no .

what ?

she 's a friend of mine

you make a nice couple .

why not ?

no .

she 's not my type .

hey --

now , if you took the ropes off , i 'd be able to feed myself .

how did you know it was her ?

my pleasure .

i seen your fucking face .

this is a farce , man .

yeah .

it was fun while it lasted .

and you know what ?

never pissed holding a girl 's hand , jude .

you 'd know i would n't run off .

no , fuck the bear . the name . jude . and it 's june . jude in june .

give me the fucking shooter !

give me the shooter , jude --

that true , fergus ? you in love ?

where are you , ol ' buddy ?

i said , tell me to go to the --

what a terrible thing to say . how could you even think that ?

reggie -- trust me once more -- please .

you lied to me so many times --

do n't be a fool ! he 's carson dyle !

reggie -- please believe me !

reggie -- why wo n't you listen ?

reggie -- stop !

well , you 're right there . ten minutes ago i had a job .

i know , but this is all we 've got left .

with whom ? where ?

grandpierre asked me about an appointment charles had -- on the day he was killed .

reggie -- i think i 've found -- are you on ?

go to bed . you 've got to be at work in the morning . there 's nothing more we can do tonight .

to the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly .

i 've looked , adam -- you know i have --

i know why you 're not taken -- no one can catch up with you .

i could eat a horse .

is there a mrs. canfield ?

no , i do -- it was the stamps on that letter charles had with him on the train . they were in plain sight all the time , but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope .

the one who said he was dyle 's brother -- of course i 'm sure -- tex wrote the word 'dyle ' before he died . he 's the murderer i tell you -- he 's the only one left ! you 've got to do something !

you 're in an ideal position -- he trusts you . besides , you said yourself , women make the best spies .

maybe he really is dyle . he could still be alive .

we know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof .

may i have a cigarette , please ?

steal it how ?

yes . the five men . they were , of course , your husband , charles , the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday , and carson dyle . but something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact . it must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money .

mrs. lampert , i really had n't planned on spending the entire night here .

i suppose you 're old enough to have heard of world war two ?

no .

agents .

what did you want to see me about , mr. bartholomew ?

you mean he might have -- mr. bartholomew , i 'm catching the next plane out of here -- i 'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me !

i do n't know who this mr. dyle is , but it 's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband .

like i said , mrs lampert -- i 'm afraid you 're in a great deal of danger . remember what happened to charles .

but --

mr. bartholomew -- if i had a quarter of a million dollars , believe me , i 'd know it .

and i 'm afraid we want it back .

oh , i see .

oh , mrs. lampert ! i 'd love to see you try and convince them of that ! oh , dear .

mr. bartholomew -- if you 're trying to frighten me you 're doing a really first-rate job !

yes . we knew him , of course , by his real name .

to be more specific , he was wanted by this agency .

yes -- that all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he 's in business .

agent .

only we call them agents .

have some , please . i 've got ... ... liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst .

mr. bartholomew -- are you sure you know who i am ?

no , thank heaven .

it 's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- i 'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie .

you 'd lie about anything .

quit stalling -- i want to see some identification -- now !

how about if next week some time i put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --

but you 're -- divorced ?

is there a mrs. cruikshank ?

mrs. foster -- send a memo to bartholomew at security recommending that --

when did you see him -- what time , i mean ?

we 'd better exchange keys . here 's mine .

me ?

and stop threatening that boy . he does n't have the money . mrs. lampert does n't either .

i 'll give you a chance , dyle -- which is more than you 'd give me . where 's the money ?

open it .

do i knock or something ?

we wait -- with our mouths shut .

the man 's the same , even if the name is n't .

it led me away from umbrella frames , for one thing . but that left me without any honest means of support .

carson dyle did n't have a brother .

no -- not yet .

every day . the manufacturer recommends it .

how often do you go through this little ritual ?

shut the door !

have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on ? what a nut .

did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf ?

hurry up and change -- i 'm starved .

yes , i know .

no -- gene kelly . remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'american in paris ' -- without a care in the world ? this is good , want some ?

what 's so illogical about that ?

do women think it 's feminine to be so illogical -- or ca n't they help it ?

he 's all yours . i 'll do tex and gideon . take jean-louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside .

i 'll be right there .

now please , reggie -- cut it out .

well , there 's your trouble right there -- you 're too old for me .

which one are you ?

there must be some way .

would you like to see where i was tattooed ?

your passport ! what kind of a proof is that ?

would you like to see my passport ?

have n't you got a bullet i can bite ?

come on -- i 've got something that stings like crazy .

good morning , mr. dyle .

no . for a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough .

the best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection . the masterpiece . it is the most valuable stamp in the world . it is called 'the gazette guyanne . ' it was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer . today it has a value of $ 100,000 . eh , bien -- i am not a thief . i knew there was some mistake . take them .

i know them as one knows his own face , even though i have never seen them . this yellow one -- a swedish four shilling -- called 'de gula fyraskillingen ' -- issued in 1854 .

yes .

nachurly . jus ' like i 'd tell you .

meaning what ?

not unless we 're blind .

what for ? if it 's not here , why bother him ?

but his mother --

dead , mrs. lampert -- like last week 's news -- like charles , mrs. lampert --

leave me alone -- !

i do n't know anything .

in mr. dyle 's room ?

i was , too .

and this ?

one more question . is this your husband 's passport ?

did you ?

`` my dear regina : i hope you are enjoying your holiday . megeve can be so lovely this time of year . the days pass very slowly and i hope to see you soon . as always , charles . p.s . your dentist called yesterday . your appointment has been changed . '' not very much , is it ?

a letter ? may i see it ?

i do n't know . perhaps he met somebody .

it is all right .

i know . i 'm sorry .

c'est absurde , madame . to-tale-ment absurde !

about how wealthy would you say ?

he did n't have one .

your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'maranguape . ' it sailed from bordeaux for maracaibo this morning at seven .

we discovered your husband 's body lying next to the tracks of the paris- bourdeaux railroad line . he was dressed only in his pajamas . do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave france ?

yes .

jean-louis -- thank heavens ! do you have -- ! what 's that ?

if you think you 're getting credit for this , you 're crazy .

i hope i do n't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait ! there is something ! if i can just -- yes , i 'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it 's heavy .

oh . neither do i. voil !

come on , now -- if you wanted to hide something , where would you put it ?

do n't tell me you did n't know it was loaded . sylvie !

they 're only trying to scare you , that 's all .

he -- he said if i did n't give the money , he 'll kill me .

yes -- that 's right .

but he did n't ! i 've looked everywhere -- and if i do n't find it -- those men going to kill me .

that 's all .

go on .

what ?

there are three men -- he 's one of them -- they think i have something that belongs to them .

be careful , peter .

out of the window , i guess -- i did n't see him .

how do you shave in there ?

you said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something .

stop this nonsense ! if you 're in some sort of trouble i want to know about it .

no , everyone . come on -- avanti , avanti !

do n't you understand french ?

what 's going on ?

i 'm sorry -- i heard the children laughing .

not too expensive -- i 'm not a lady of leisure anymore .

instant divorce you mean ?

try and get my old job back at unesco , i suppose .

it 's in all the afternoon papers . i 'm very sorry .

are you in the book ?

oh . well , was n't it shakespeare who said : `` when strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again '' ?

no , i 'm not -- i 've got some packing to do . i 'm also going back to paris today .

oh , charles is hardly ever with me . first it was separate rooms -- now we 're trying it with cities . what do people call you -- pete ?

yes , but we 're divorced .

yes , i am -- i 'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me . like when you go into a drugstore .

no , you see , i do n't really love him .

yes .

i 'm regina lampert .

i 'm afraid you 're blocking my view .

clever fellow -- almost missed me .

i 'm afraid i already know a great many people . until one of them dies i could n't possibly meet anyone else .

do n't make too much noise , miz lampert --

stop that !

come on now -- sure you do . an ' you 'd better give it to me , miz lampert -- cuz i ai n't foolin ' . no sireebob !

those stamps -- they 're worth a fortune !

oh la vache !

i do n't know . but if this is a sample of american diplomacy i 'm buying a fallout shelter .

but that is no reason to get a divorce !

but why do you want a divorce ?

va jouer , mon ange .

is n't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche ?

we want that money -- now !

you do ?

he should . four guys hit on me today , and not because they find me intellectually stimulating .

why ?

do n't flatter yourself . you 'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me ben .

ok not your imports . all your other cds and your k2 snowboard .

i get all your cds .

are you the killer ben ?

if i 'm so all-used-up ben , why do you try to hook me up non-stop ?

that 's impossible .

it 's lisa sherman . but she still looks like we 're eighteen .

you tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we 're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands .

is there anything you do ?

why 'd you send for lenny marliston ?

fine , just do n't mention the carving this is going to be a tough enough day as it is .

ok. goodbye . now get back to school .

you know her ?

it was a she .

i 'm not .

you never went , uh , all the way ?

well yeah . of course . everyone kisses .

i will . is that all ?

had either of them broken up with someone recently ? hurt someone ?

how well did you know stacy and rod ?

it wo n't happen again .

what ? i was at sandy 's i just lost track of time .

no ?

as bizarre as it may sound , seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight .

we need you here . i can bring her in .

no pictures . no mirrors . was she a crazy woman when you knew her ?

i 'm looking for lisa sherman .

jesus . any word from brent ?

we just found another body .

you fucked me up !

pay no attention to me .

yes that 's the whole point . this is what i was put on this earth to do . rape the town that raped my mother . steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers . i 've planned this since i was a very little boy . you have no real freedom either . your father has cast a shadow that you 've never eluded .

yes . we have no real freedom . you of all people should understand that . this may sting .

i really do . for your own safety .

you know about that too ?

can you just follow me ? the back is full ?

jody , you have to go to the party . for your own safety .

i ca n't right now .

ok. increase the peace .

i keep a couple of my dad 's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference .

want to come in for awhile ? log onto aol , flirt with some married men , head into a private s & m chat room . . .

that was before he pulled this 'dick me or i dump you ' shit . i say fuck his best friend .

you 're the one always saying 'just do it ' .

no !

he says he loves me .

i was desperate . it was gross .

oh nice save .

but you ca n't do any of it . so it sucks . i always have to 'set an example ' .

you 're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now .

why ? all my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they 've been married for twenty years .

you eventually have to talk to him .

you stare at him non-stop , like every lunch . like this . like most people stare at car accidents .

go sit next to him .

you miss dunlop ?

do n't you think it 's sick ?

everyone 's getting ready for the party .

hi miss dunlop . where do you keep the old town papers ?

deputy webber 's at the party . it 's only three blocks away .

please do n't go . please . stay , we 'll just talk . then go to the party .

i do n't know . i kind of am .

but if he 'd been sent to jail , there would be no jody .

i think this is a big part of growing up . it 's losing your spiritual virginity . it 's when you finally discover that your parents are n't anything they told you they were . they 're even bigger hypocrites than your friends .

yes !

i 'll think about it .

yes you are . you always do . it 's why we broke up . you always hide behind him .

no i 'm really grounded . when i got in late the other night , my father was waiting up for me .

three of our classmates are dead . that 's not really the occasion for a party .

i was worried about you . did you hear about the bash ?

jody , we 've been going out for over a year . i love you but i 'm all out of patience .

fuck your curfew . most sixth graders can stay out later than you .

who was the fourth ?

the men . do any of them still live around here ?

i 've regretted it ever since . never run with the herd just because they 're the herd .

i do n't know . we just did . i guess i was kind of scared going against the gain . against the whole town .

everyone just kind of looked the other way .

they were proving to her they were n't . they were very drunk . things were different back then . you think kids are sexually bottled up today ... .

why not ?

no , i believed her . she was in pretty bad shape . inside and out . but the boys were never formally charged .

she was raped . at least that 's what she claimed .

i 'm not leaving . i want to know why you and dad are so freaked out . three of my classmates are dead .

wait .

who is she ?

not that i know of .

i 've never heard of her . maybe something else was on his mind .

i do n't know . where did you hear that name .

yeah . who is she ?

lisa sherman ?

yes ?

his mother 's an only child .

on what side of the family ?

yeah .

what are you doing ?

you 're the one who 's hand is shaking .

you 're so beautiful .

no , you keep one .

you can have both if you want .

they 're tasty .

dylan 's been telling people that annette gave him a blow job .

hey ! that was a 3k machine .

you ca n't bring it .

ok .

that was n't me ...

yeah . i 'm extremely worried about that . it 's right up there with global warming .

and only then does our noble friend realize ...

... -to a simple thing like ...

some people might say you 're readin ' an awful lot in- ...

... without caution ...

mr. sweeney , how goes it ?

... side !

then how about if i call you `` ass- ...

mason , you would n't know the truth if it bit you . we 've got your whole record . we know about the-the conviction for vagrancy ...

if it was wednesday night , i was workin ' .

... uh , drifting around like the trash you are , or were you here workin ' ?

so , mason , last wednesday night , uh ... were you out ...



int . andy 's ice cream factory/andy 's office - day .

int . brynner 's van - day .



get in

it 's too late , mason . i 've ...

int . postal van - day .

int . vitelli 's helicopter - day .

uh , so head for the other end of the tunnel .

i do n't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact it surprised me it was so quick . i make an honest living .

look , pal . i make an honest living . people do n't come to me unless they 're miserable and i help 'em out of a bad situation . i do n't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank .

a ruler ?

well , then , how about a ruler ?

can i check one of these volumes out ?

row twenty-three , section c .

how much are you worth ?

there 's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they 're paying for water they 're not getting .

have n't the faintest idea .

where is she ?

she 's fine .

if you want to hire me , i still have to know what you and mulwray were arguing about .

i did n't realize you and hollis were so fond of each other .

just find the girl , mr. gittes . i think she is frightened and i happen to know hollis was fond of her . i 'd like to help her if i can .

what about her ?

my daughter .

does n't that strike you as odd ?

mainly that you 're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers .

it 's what the d.a . used to tell me about chinatown .

if you want an answer to that question i can always put one of my men on the job . good afternoon , mr. cross .

we worked in chinatown together .

oh yes .

lou escobar he 's a lieutenant .

fine , as long as you do n't serve chicken that way .

how did she get that idea ?

no . she happens to think the last one was murdered .

you know , you 've got a nasty reputation , mr. gittes . i like that .

what ? oh , damn near yes . unless the animal 's sick or something . and the steam rising off it like that in the morning . that 's life , mr. gittes . life .

have you got your checkbook handy , mr. cross ? i 've got the girl .

curly , you know how long i been in business .

okay , you got yourself a boat .

i might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you . maybe an even hundred .

i do n't know ...

forget it . how would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to ensenada ... you 'd have to leave tonight .

right now , curly . it ca n't wait .

where 's that ?

sure thing .

just sitting down to supper , jake . care to join us ?

what kind of guy do you think i am ?

... no ...

not for your wife . that 's the unwritten law .

they do n't kill a guy for that .

thanks . you know something , jake ?

you 're absolutely right , i would n't give her another thought .

what can i tell you , kid ? you 're right . when you 're right , you 're right , and you 're right .

she 's just no good .

okay .

there 's seven ashtrays in this room , duffy .

shut up , duffy , you 're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the chinese do ? so he says what do they do ? his friend says the chinese they screw for a while . just listen a second , duffy ...

but what ?

give us things . not just some old flag like this , but -

the apple core ?

where did you get this material ?

i 'm not .

why ?

lou , she will kill you . let her go for now . you do n't know .

that 's it ?

where ?

shut up . go on .

and why 's that ?

this broad hired you , gittes , not evelyn mulwray .

i want the rest of the pictures .

let me show you something .

no .

well , sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and i guess you have .

well , to tell you the truth , i lied a little .

hello , jake .

a private investigator ?

a complete surprise ?

certainly not !

do you know where she might be ?

it looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel . could he swim ?

yeah ... where are you taking her now ?

... he had a breakdown ... the dam broke ... my mother died ... he became a little boy ... i was fifteen ... he 'd ask me what to eat for breakfast , what clothes to wear ! ... it happened ... then i ran away ...

she 's my sister and my daughter !

... no ...

i do n't know what you 're talking about . this is the most insane ... the craziest thing i ever ...

yes positively . that 's where he was drowned ...

what the hell is this all about ?

do n't worry . i can recommend a couple . they 're expensive but you can afford it .

no ...

are n't you coming back with me ?

i will if you do n't .

you wo n't go to the police if i tell you ?

like she knows about hollis ' death . like she knows more than you want her to tell .

it 's possible .

mulwray 's girlfriend , for one thing . he wanted to know where she was .

that you were jealous , and he was worried about what you might do .

there has n't been a lot of time .

it has to do with my father .

the albacore club .

where are you going ?

and i want to know where .

there 's something black in the green part of your eye .

could you do anything about it ?

hold still . why ?

boy oh boy , you 're a mess .

they do in chinatown .

doing what ?

what 's that , mrs. mulwray ?

no question from you is innocent , mr. gittes .

we got it . we got it , baby .

it 's why he was killed . jasper lamar crabb . jasper lamar crabb .

what dam ?

not over me . why would they have a falling out over me ?

yes , of course . it was quite a while after . i was just out of grade school when they did that .

wait a minute , sonny . i think you better come with me .

oh , no . i 've got my own car . the creamcolored packard .

another satisfied client 's wife .

maybe putting your nose in other people 's business ?

been meaning to talk to you about that .

no . i 'm just a snoop .

you must 've had a reason to ask me that .

you were seeing someone , too .

well i would n't run home and tell him whenever i went to bed with someone , if that 's what you mean .

yes . as i said , i was very grateful .

... just a minute ...

please call first .

no , just riding bareback , that 's all . anyway , you might try the oak pass or stone canyon reservoirs . sometimes at lunch hollis takes walks around them . otherwise he 'll be home by 6:30 .

it 's very personal . it could n't be more personal . is this a business or an obsession with you ?

suppose they did . how does it concern you ?

may i speak frankly , mrs. mulwray ?

you see , somebody went to a lot of trouble here , and i want to find out , lawsuit or no lawsuit . i 'm not the one who 's supposed to be caught with my pants down ... so i 'd like to see your husband . unless that 's a problem .

i should talk this over with your husband .

mr. gittes , you 've talked me into it . i 'll drop the lawsuit .

yeah . fine , thank you .

not that mulwray ?

sophie .

oh yeah ? you pick up the watch ?

i think i got something .

listen , we ca n't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something .

what 'd you expect ? that 's his job .

well , i 'm a working girl , mr. gittes . i did n't come in to see you on my own .

oh yes we have ... are you alone , mr. gittes ?

hello , miss sessions . i do n't believe we 've had the pleasure .

we understand , c'mon , sweetheart .

i do n't think so . be happy to show you .

oh , good .

perhaps if we could meet your father .

naturally , i want the best for him , money is no object .

nothing to do with dad . it 's me , actually .

yes ...

mr. gittes , you 're not making a bit of sense .

neither do i , actually . but you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me .

oh yes . hollis was the best department head the city 's ever had . my goodness , what happened to your nose ?

mr. gittes , sorry to keep you waiting . these staff meetings , they just go on and on .

hope so . he 's working for us .

relax , mulvihill , glad to see you . do you know claude mulvihill here ?

you do n't happen to know where mr. mulwray 's having lunch ?

well , no .

when it comes .

what about the water ?

si .

so how are you , morty ?

that 's a long fall .

nothin ' , morty , it 's my lunch hour , i thought i 'd drop by and see who died lately .

all right , what 's your husband 's first name ?

mrs. mulwray , do you love your husband ?

now , what makes you certain he is involved with someone ?

i 'm afraid not , mrs. mulwray . these men are my operatives and at some point they 're going to assist me . i ca n't do everything myself .

mulwray ? i thought you said cross owned the department .

how did they get it away from him ?

he owned it .

yes . no .

he 's liable to be tied up indefinitely .

gee whiz . and i 'm late .

gittes .

sue people like that they 're liable to be having dinner with the judge who 's trying the suit .

let me explain something to you , walsh . this business requires a certain finesse .

jesus christ , walsh . that 's what you spent your day doing ?

tell me , how many people a week do you foreclose on ?

she ran off to mexico . rumor was she was knocked up and did n't even know who the father was . went there to get rid of it .

she must be about thirty-three , thirty- four .

she ai n't exactly long in the tooth now .

i 'm going to see a man called julian cross . ever heard of him ?

lots of fellas do . tell the little woman they 're going on a fishing trip , then shack up with some little twist on the island ... she pretty ?

now i understand why the soldier went away just before the end . that 's right , just one more night and the princess would have been his . but she , also , could not have kept her promise . and ... that would have been terrible , he would have died from it . so instead , for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him ...

it was probably meant to be like this . each of us has a star to follow . so now what are you thinking of doing ?

you 're thinner ... you can tell you 've not been treated well . .

but where 'd you go , toto ? ! !

no , alfredo , i was coming to help you ...

just so , alfredo . there is n't any . and if you buy a television set , you can watch it at home , without any fuss ...

you see , it s like i say . you always have an answer for everything .

what you say is wonderful ! but sad ...

yes , it 's a girl i saw at the station .

is there a woman ? ... tell me the truth ... there is a woman .

i 've shown it so many times i know it by heart . the first time i showed it , in 1940 , was the sunday my first wife died . they kept it hidden from me all day so they would n't have to close down the movie house . i only found out that night , after the last show . those are things you never forget ... so , toto , how are these home movies going ?

for example , at this moment the film 's out of focus . go see .

ok. ok. but now that i 've got a job , i'11 probably stop going ...

then why do n't you change jobs ?

but you do n't have any kids ! ! !

fifty lire ...

look , toto ! before i kick your ass all the way to china and back , let 's make a deal . these strips here are yours , i give them to you . however ! one you 're not to stick your nose in here any more . two i 'll keep them for you , because you ca n't take them home for god forbid and save our souls , if they catch fire , all hell will break loose ! ok ? oh ! ! ! and now scram !

but alfredo , what you 're saying is horrifying !

i 'll never agree with you . never , elena .

nor have i. even though you disappeared ... but what 's the point of talking about it ? we risk being pathetic and ridiculous . you still live in rome ?

i saw your daughter . she 's beautiful ! who knows how many salvatores must be running after her ...

alfredo died . do you remember him ?

bye-bye , elena . ... what an idiot ! what an idiot ! 'nice day ' ! christ ! !

daddy 's not coming back ... he 's dead .

then where 's the money ?

no ...

how long 's it been shut ?

don ciccio , i 've got an idea ... you remember that old abandoned movie house where they 're supposed to build those low-rent houses ?

please , mr. bernstein .

two hundred and one thousand , six hundred and forty-seven .

you know how long it took the `` chronicle '' to get that staff together ? twenty years .

you 're right , mr. bernstein .

look at that .

from the chronicle building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let 's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough .

oh !

it is n't here , mr. bernstein . i 'm dictating it .

`` her singing , happily , is no concern of this department . of her acting , it is absolutely impossible to ... ''

mr. kane -

i rather like it myself . send it right away .

how are you , mr. thatcher ?

mr. bernstein , mr. thatcher -

enthusiastic ?

and the social . how about the music notice ? you got that in ?

maybe that was something he lost . mr. kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had - you ought to talk to bradford leland . he could tell you a lot . i wish i could tell you where leland is , but i do n't know myself . he may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead .

it did n't end very well , did it ?

oh , yes . he saw to that . i tell you , mr. thompson , he was a hard man to figure out . he had that funny sense of humor . and then , too , maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show leland he was an honest man . you see , leland did n't think so . i guess he showed him all right . he 's a nice fellow , but he 's a dreamer . they were always together in those early days when we just started the enquirer .

you know why ? she was so -

who else you been to see ?

i 'm calling on people who knew mr. kane . i 'm calling on you .

you 're pretty young , mr. - mr. thompson . a fellow will remember things you would n't think he 'd remember . you take me . one day , back in 1896 , i was crossing over to jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out , there was another ferry pulling in - - and on it , there was a girl waiting to get off . a white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and i only saw her for one second and she did n't see me at all - but i 'll bet a month has n't gone by since that i have n't thought of that girl . see what i mean ? well , so what are you doing about this `` rosebud , '' mr. thompson .

- we thought maybe , if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -

mr. kane is finishing your piece the way you started it .

i 'm all right , mr. leland . only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me . i learned 'em ! did n't i , officer ?



yes .

do we stand for the same things that the `` chronicle '' stands for , mr. bernstein ?

yes .

that looks pretty nice .

charlie ? !

it 's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -

but mr. kane , i meant -

it is accepted , mr. carter , with assurances of my deepest regard .

it 's not our function to report the gossip of housewives . if we were interested in that kind of thing , mr. kane , we could fill the paper twice over daily -

i 'm still hungry , brad . let 's go to rector 's and get something decent . the `` chronicle '' has a two-column headline , mr. carter . why have n't we ?

but a morning newspaper , mr. kane . after all , we 're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -

you may resume your work , gentlemen . i did n't know your plans and so i was unable to make any preparations .

yes , mr. kane .

exactly according to your instructions , mr. kane . we 've got two spreads of pictures .

i 'm sure that 's it .

i 'd rather mr. kane withdrew without having to get the story published . not that i care about him . but i 'd be better off that way - - and so would you , mrs. kane .

what story , mr. rogers ?

i made miss - miss alexander send you the note . she was a little unwilling at first - but she did it .

emily , you -

emily , you 're being - a little unfair - you know what i think of charles ' behavior - about your personal lives -

emily !

you decided what you were going to do , charles - some time ago . you ca n't always have it your own way , regardless of anything else that may have happened . come on , charles .

i suppose so , but - i 'm not afraid of the story . you ca n't tell me that the voters of this state -

you 're a cheap , crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -

no , it ca n't . good night , darling .

i 'm sending junior home in the car , charles - with oliver -

susan , do n't go ! susan , please !

let 's not start all over again , charlie . we 've said everything that can be said .

i wo n't let you go .

- and left ? of course they 'll hear . i 'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but i never imagined that people would n't know .

yes .

no , you 're not .

i 'm going to leave you .

well , i 'm not going to stop it . i 'm going to say exactly what i think . you 've never given me anything . you 've tried to buy me into giving you something . you 're - - it 's like you were bribing me ! that 's what it 's been from the first moment i met you . no matter how much it cost you - your time , your money - that 's what you 've done with everybody you 've ever known . tried to bribe them !

as far as you 're concerned , susan , i 've never wanted anything - i do n't want anything now - except what you want .

you 're in a tent , darling . you 're not at home . and i can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice .

it makes a whole lot more sense than collecting venuses .

at night ?

half past eleven .

i mean in new york .

i could n't make you see how i felt , charlie . i just could n't - i could n't go threw with singing again . you do n't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience do n't want you . that if you have n't got what they want - a real voice - they just do n't care about you . even when they 're polite - and they do n't laugh or get restless or - you know ... they do n't want you . they just 0

well , i -

is that what you want to do ?

oh , me -

but you like me , do n't you ? even though you do n't know who i am ?

you really do n't know who i am ?

excuse me , mr. kane . i know this takes a lot of nerve , but - who are you ? i mean - i 'm pretty ignorant , i guess you caught on to that -

oh !

you 're very easily amused .

i 'm sorry . they live here , too ?

if these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -

ow !

you ca n't blackmail me , rogers , you ca n't -

you 're the greatest fool i 've ever known , kane . if it was anybody else , i 'd say what 's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you . only you 're going to need more than one lesson . and you 're going to get more than one lesson .

you 've made your point perfectly clear , mr. kane . good day .

mr. kane , how can i persuade you -

if you 're interested in what people say , signor matisti , i may be able to enlighten you a bit . the newspapers , for instance . i 'm an authority on what the papers will say , signor matisti , because i own eight of them between here and san francisco ... it 's all right , dear . signor matisti is going to listen to reason . are n't you , maestro ?

you 're right . we did lose a million dollars last year .

on the other hand - i am the publisher of the enquirer . as such , it is my duty - i 'll let you in on a little secret , it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent , hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money- mad pirates because , god help them , they have no one to look after their interests ! i 'll let you in on another little secret , mr. thatcher . i think i 'm the man to do it . you see , i have money and property -

you see ! there has n't been a true word -

`` enemy armada off jersey coast . '' you know you have n't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the jersey coast .

your mother wo n't be going right away , charles -

i did n't used to be afraid of it .

yes , sir -

raymond -

marie has been packing since morning , mr. kane .

mrs. kane would like to see you , mr. kane .

hello , charlie - i did n't know we were speaking .

nothing - if she dose n't love me -

that 's all right . what are you going to do about emily ?

you 're not going to like it in chicago . they wind comes howling in from the lake . and there 's practically no opera season at all - and the lord only knows whether they 've ever heard of lobster newburg -

i do n't think so , brad . we 've just had word that the president is out of danger . it seems i did n't kill him after all .

i 'll get you some coffee .

what 's wrong , brad ?

i 've got to think of emily -

oil belonging to the people of the united states was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks - nobody can blame me because -

i said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -

yesterday morning you called the president a traitor . what do you think that crowd is doing down there ? they think you murdered him .

what do you mean by that ?

why not ? well - nobody 's a great man in your estimation until he 's dead .

why not ?

charlie -

take dictation - front page editorial - `` this afternoon a great man was assassinated . he was the president of the united states - ''

it does n't make any difference about me , but one of these days you 're going to find out that all this charm of yours wo n't be enough -

yes ?

and i do it because they do it , and they do it - it 's a vicious circle , is n't it ? i 'm going over to georgie 's , brad - you know , georgie , do n't you ?

but there is no front , charlie . there 's a very doubtful civil war . besides , i do n't want the job .

it 'll be our first foreign war in fifty years , brad . we 'll cover it the way the `` hickville gazette '' covers the church social ! the names of everybody there ; what they wore ; what they ate ; who won the prizes ; who gave the prizes - i tell you , brad , i envy you . by bradford leland , the `` enquirer 's '' special correspondent at the front . i 'm almost tempted -

what makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid , something inflexible , that people are supposed to pay two cents for -

it does seem too good to be true , does n't it , mr. bernstein ?

what check ?

maybe we 'd better wait for more word on the president 's condition .

it is . go on , mr. thatcher -

well , let 's hope it 's all for the best .

you people seem to forget that i 'm the boy 's father .

i guess maybe i 'm not as hard to see through as i think . anyway , i never even answered his letter . maybe i should have . i guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years . he had n't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything . of course , he built it for her -

it 's a letter from her lawyers .

you do n't happen to have a cigar , do you ? i 've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he has n't got one - who thinks i 'm going to stop smoking ... i changed the subject , did n't i ? dear , dear ! what a disagreeable old man i 've become . you want to know what i think of charlie kane ? well - i suppose he has some private sort of greatness . but he kept it to himself . he never - gave himself away - he never gave anything away . he just - left you a tip . he had a generous mind . i do n't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions . that was because he had the power to express them , and charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it - but he did n't believe in anything except charlie kane . he never had a conviction in his life . i guess he died without one - that must have been pretty unpleasant . of course , a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death . but we do know what we 're leaving ... we believe in something . you 're absolutely sure you have n't got a cigar ?

this is mr. thatcher , charles .

i wonder - you put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell ?

yeah , all in crates .

i 'll get to it right away , mr. rawlston .

but do n't you think if we release it now - he 's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -

ask the question anyway , thompson ! build the picture around the question , even if you ca n't answer it .

we 're leaving tonight . as soon as they 're through photographing the stuff -

yes and no .

yeah . i guess he was n't very happy those last years - he did n't have much reason to be -

the last ten years have been tough on a lot of people .

he wanted me to be comfortable - oh , why should i bother ? you do n't believe me , but it 's true . it just happens to be true . he was really interested in my voice . what are you smiling for ? what do you think he built that opera house for ? i did n't want it . i did n't want to sing . it was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him .

he was in love with me . but he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that norton woman divorced him .

i 'd rather you just talked . anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and mr. kane .

i 'll come down in a week or so and see her again . say , you might be able to help me . when she used to talk about kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about rosebud ?

pack of cigarettes . what 's that ?

it 's not the same .

do you really want to buy those cigarettes ?

am i sure about what ?

you 're the disturbance , pal ! and here ... i 'm buying some ... what 's this ? ... chewlie 's gum . there . i 'm no longer loitering . i 'm a customer , a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers .

beats me .

do you mind if i drink this here ?

i feel nauseous .

it was so cool . he did n't say a word . he was just ... ready , you know ? and we did n't kiss or talk or anything . he just sat there and let me do all the work .

i 'll try to manage .

and i 'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss , and my desire to piss with the light on .

nobody can figure it out . and the boss does n't want to pay the electrician to fix it , because the electrician owes money to the video store .

can i use the bathroom ?

god , is n't he great ?

exactly .

dick .

wow . hey , i was just about to order some dinner . you eat chinese , right ?

you might be let down . i 'm not a hermaphrodite .

there 's a strange man in our bathroom , and he just raped caitlin !

we did n't just have sex in the bathroom ?

yeah , right . who was it : randal ?

when you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything .

i left like an hour ago .

who does n't ?

he 's your fianc .

how about the caitlin bree walk on the boardwalk , then get naked somewhere kind of private date ?

you mean , on a date ?

so ... what ? so we should just make pretend over the phone that we 're dating ?

it 's just the shock of seeing me after three years . believe me , you 'll get over it .

i would like to be your boyfriend , yes .

sang ? his name is a past tense ?

i do n't want to marry him . i do n't want to get married now . i 'm on the verge of graduation . i want to go to grad school after this . and then i want to start a career . i do n't want to be a wife first , and then have to worry about when i 'm going to fit in all of the other stuff . i 've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife . and i know that 's what i 'd become . sang 's already signed with a major firm , and he 's going to be pulling a huge salary , which would give me no reason to work , and he 's so traditional anyway ...

thanks for the vote of confidence .

the story goes like this : he proposed , and i told him i had to think about it , and he insisted i wear the ring anyway . then my mother told the paper we were engaged .

so you 're really getting married ?

is that what they teach you at that school of yours ? kind of , sort of ? everyone knows about this except me ! do you know how humiliating that is ?

and you said yes ?

i was going to tell you . but then we were getting along so well , i did n't want to mess it up .

i ca n't believe you 're here .

train . it took eight hours .

dante . you 've got a customer .

shock trauma . she 's going to need years of therapy after this . my question is , how did she come to have sex with the dead man ?

i ca n't say for certain until we get him back to the lab , but my guess is he was masturbating , his heart seized and he died . that 's when the girl found him . something smells like shoe polish .

no . i place the time of death at about three-twenty .

nobody . it was closed .

we did .

um ... i do n't know . what time did hockey end ?

so i 'm told .

well , he missed !

i 'm gon na break your fucking head ! you fucking jerkoff !

they certainly do . two fifty-five .

that 's easy to say from over here .

i can pass !

we 're sorry , ma'am . we got a little carried away .

using filthy language in front of the customers ... you should both get fired .

are you open ?

cute cat . what 's his name .

so i 'm no more responsible for my own decisions while i 'm here at work than , say , the death squad soldiers in bosnia ?

awww , he 's so cute . what 's his name ?

hey man , i hear caitlin 's marrying an asian drum major .

all right . jesus , you fuckers are pushy .

what responsibility ? you 're closing the fucking store to play hockey .

i 'm gone . i 'll talk to you tomorrow .

i 'm calling out . going to hit the hospital-see how caitlin is . then try to see veronica .

it 's not like i 'm miles away .

what do n't you do ? randal , sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable .

why do i say that ? randal ... forget it .

oh please ! i 'm surprised i did n't kill you .

you still did n't have to choke me .

lovely story .

i ca n't , all right ! jesus , would you leave me alone ? i ca n't make changes like that in my life . if i could , i would-but i do n't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes .

melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement .

what ? the dead guy ? she 'll get over fucking the dead guy . shit , my mom 's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years ; i call him dad .

... if i was n't such a fucking coward . it must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do .

leave me alone .

it 's the same thing with veronica .

you 're comfortable . this is a life of convenience for you , and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you 've fashioned for yourself .

fuck you .

what are you talking about ?

thirty-seven .

have some chips ; you 'll feel better .

this life ?

what time did we go to the funeral ?

she said she did all the work .

maybe the asian design major slipped her some opium ?

watch the store while i go home and change .

you 're kidding .

because i 'm happy .

i swear . i could n't make this kind of hell up .

then how come you got the fine ?

i did n't think they even enforced this .

and this is what you rented ?

you 're a danger to both the dead and the living .

so your argument is that title dictates behavior ?

there 's a difference . those were obligations . obligations that could not have been met at any later date . now renting videos-that 's just gratuitous , not to mention illogical , considering you work in a video store .

you work in a video store !

nobody 's there . it 's four o'clock on a saturday . how many people ever come to the store at four on a saturday ?

listen to you .

i know it was a bad idea to close the store .

his dick was in his mouth ?

my cousin ? my aunt found him . on his bed , doubled over himself with his legs on top . dick in his mouth . my aunt freaked out . it was a mess .

yeah sure . you 're so repressed .

no !

oh , my god .

an embarrassing way to die .

no , you 're not .

i 'm gon na go to her wake .

oh , my god .

no , i 'm serious .

randal , twelve minutes is not a game ! jesus , it 's barely a warm-up !

we 're not playing in the street .

he 's blunt , but he 's got a point .

you 've got a customer .

because you buckled .

what ?

fuck !

so , what-you 're stuck here all day ?

vermont ?

can you come next door ? i got ta make a phone call .

thirty-seven !

veronica !

why not ?

there are n't .

can we talk about this later ?

he 's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off .

you know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour ?

did you ever notice all the prices end in nine ? damn , that 's eerie .

it 's not like you laid the eggs yourself .

perfect dozen .

what 's he looking for ?

not just imperials , is what you 're getting at .

so ?

luke blew it up . give credit where it 's due .

yeah .

more or less .

it would stand to reason , yes .

yeah .

i guess .

right , the emperor . now the emperor is kind of a spiritual figure , yes ?

empire had the better ending : luke gets his hand cut off , and finds out vader 's his father ; han gets frozen and taken away by boba fett . it ends on such a down note . and that 's life-a series of down endings . all jedi had was a bunch of muppets .

blasphemy .

did n't you hear me ? caitlin really is getting married .

return of the jedi .

all four ?

i think the arguments veronica and i are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that i can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with caitlin .

what about veronica ?

in light of this lurid tale , i do n't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles .

that 's not cheating . people say crazy shit during sex . one time , i called this girl `` mom . ''

party at john k's-senior year . i get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom . caitlin comes in and dives all over me .

chick 's nuts about you . how long did you date caitlin ?

i 'm going to offer you some advice , my friend : let the past be the past . forget caitlin bree . you 've been with veronica for how long now ?

you called caitlin again ?

what time do you have to stay till ?

shit , if i 'd known you were working , i would 've come even later .

someone jammed gum in the locks .

the boss called . arthur fell ill .

what the hell are you doing here ? i thought you were playing hockey at one .

you 're late .

jesus christ , what next ?

the glades motel ?

you know him ?

i 'm her sister .

caitlin bree . yeah ?

he 's got those love handles .

yes .

are you open ?

forget it . i do n't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old . can i offer you a ride somewhere ?

wait a second ! you used to sleep with caitlin bree ? while i was dating her ?

what ?

oh man ! hey , you still going out with her ?

how do you know that ?

pretty girl , about this girl 's height- dark hair-gorgeous body ?

yeah .

did you say caitlin bree ?

oh for god 's sake !

i 've had girlfriends , but all they wanted from me was weed and shit . shit , my grandma used to say , `` which is better : a good plate with nothing on it ... '' no , wait . i fucked up . she said `` what 's a good-looking plate with nothing on it ? ''

she 's my girlfriend .

damn . she sure goes out of her way .

maybe .

knock it off . that used to be my girlfriend .

he died in the bathroom .

i ca n't believe you just rolled a joint in here .

one seventy-nine .

noinch , noinch , noinch-smoking weed , smoking weed ! doing coke ! drinking beers ! a pack of wraps , my good man . it 's time to kick back , drink some beers , and smoke some weed !

how many times i got ta tell you not to deal outside the store .

if you 'll just tell me the title of your rental choice , i 'll have him hold it for you .

such a wiseass . but go ahead . crack wise . that 's why you 're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day 's work . i got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch . you make sure this gets back . the number 's eight-twelve-wynarski . and i wanted to get a damn movie , too .

no , i mean the ones there . behind the counter .

i said go ahead .

thanks , young man . you 've got a heart of gold .

i 'm not asking about the color . i mean is it rough or cottony ?

thanks son . say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there ?

oh ... can i help you ?

and he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass ... ?

i had a friend that used to chew glass for a living . in the circus .

you know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer .

fuck you .

sure .

you could n't get these shutters open ?

at least he was n't thirty-six .

i 'm glad you 've calmed down a bit . hi , randal .

peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off . what do you think it is ? it 's lasagne .

i 'm going to school . maybe later you 'll be a bit more rational .

hey listen , jerk ! until today you never even knew how many guys i 'd slept with , because you never even asked . and then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls . well , i never had sex with twelve different guys !

thirty-seven ? ! my girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks !

lower your voice !

please calm down .

i 'm serious ...

he gets off on it .

what do you mean ?

all right . name it .

after dropping a bombshell like that , you owe me . big .

i am . and that 's why you should feel like a pig . you men make me sick . you 'll sleep with anything that says yes .

no ; who were the three , besides me ?

three including you .

three .

what the hell was that for ?

including you ?

we might have ; i do n't remember . how many ?

how many girls have you slept with ?

these are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me .

i 'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life .

and i actually date you ?

`` be there ? ''

how do you figure ?

ooh ! can we ? !

honesty through paranoia . why do you smell like shoe polish ?

you 're trusting .

what were you doing ?

i 'm only here until twelve , then i 'm gone . the boss is coming in .

the guy got sick and could n't come in .

all i 'm saying is that if you 're unhappy you should leave .

i hate this fucking place .

at least they were n't lit .

all right , stupid question . but do n't you think you 're taking this a bit too hard ?

they oughta put some kind of warning on these cans , like they do with cigarettes .

what are you talking about ?

dante hicks . why ? what is this about ?

were you working here at about four o'clock ?

swear . olaf , metal !

no way !

no way .

he 's your cousin ?

is he staying here ?

she said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm .

to an asian design major .

no way !

screw you !

well this is the last time i ever rent here ...

you hope what feels good ?

i hope it feels good .

i only pointed out that you were n't paying any attention to what i was saying .

your ruse . your cunning attempt to trick me .

i do n't think your manager would appreciate ...

for this kind of hash , you need that kind of cash .

yo , i do n't have that kind of cash .

um , do you think you can give me a lift home tonight ?

you 're not ?

twenty bucks .

like hell you are !

says me . i 've been here for half an hour . i 'd call that first dibs .

which one ?

man ! i hate it when i ca n't rent videos !

willam !

man , i hate work even when somebody else does it !

how yo doin ' , gabe !

did i hear somethin ' break ? outside left !

if you ca n't make it back , i 'll hold up at the douglas shaft . stop worryin ' . you sound like a mother hen .

jessie , girl this is insane . weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight .

if i do n't meet up with them , you can come and pick me up by nightfall .

he said the tower , but he 's on comb bluff ? frank , fly me to the west valley , the winds are never too bad there and it 's only a half hour climb to the douglas shaft .

so , what do you see ?

hey , jessie , you 're just in time for another masterpiece .

when she 's safe !

you do , and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash !

jessie ! are you alright ?

i need my bolt gun and an ice axe .

not on that leg .

i 'm going with you .

look , it was a bad time for everybody .

i did what i thought was right .

look , i know --

hey , fuck you .

rescue one -- have located helpless climber , please prepare < u > idiot line < /u > for transport , over .

i love you , too .

use your other hand ! grab it !

three ...

two ...

there you go .

i 'm sorry for all the trouble ... thank you .

fine , i guess ...

how 're ya feeling ?

and miss all of this peace and quiet ? never , right hal ?

what about you ? !

ca n't do it . now go back and get help !

just kidding .

do n't lay any guilt on me . suicide 's a personal thing , best done alone .

fine , it should n't bother your conscience .

i 'm going to wrap it around your throat !

oh , good . for a minute i thought you 'd lost your mind .

if we go along the northern ridge , we can get there first .

we were going together before i ever let go of you .

jess , c'mon ...

this rope is sixty years old !

pull it apart !

we might be able to go that way .

get it !

for the record , whenever you hear me sliding out of control , i 'm never alright . when i secure the line , come on up .

breathtaking .

want me to lead ?

a simple yes or no would have done .

if you 're not using your arm , can i borrow it ?

remember the first time we came up here ?

you know me , i 'm a night person .

i ca n't . the radio 's at the bottom of the shaft . but frank 'll be looking for me soon . when he gets here i 'll contact everybody from the chopper .

looking for hal . oh my god , i heard someone kick the door open ... you came back .

i only came back for you .

i know you do n't want to be responsible for anybody 's life anymore , but walk away and you are responsible . please gabe , he went up the west ridge . if you go up the south face , you can catch him , no problem --

what if he ca n't ?

you come back after being gone almost a year , and you expect me to just leave ... this was < u > our < /u > home , now it 's < u > my < /u > home . i ca n't leave . you can stay with me , and believe me , i want you to , but to just take off for the wrong reasons , i ca n't do it . and you should n't either .

i ca n't . not here . if you want , i 'd like you to come with me ... somewhere else .

why are you yelling ?

i ca n't blame anything on hal . it was me . i play it back in my mind everyday .

i know ...

a lot of things fell apart up there .

after the funeral i just had to leave .

working ... i 'm trying to figure out where to start .

you can stop right there .

do n't say that . you 'll embarrass frank .

look here , the mountain man . you 're walker , right ?

when he finds the money , you 're as dead as me .

travers , you 're not running things .

there is .

half a day .

acknowledge . winds are too strong to get a chopper up there , are you near any natural shelter ? over .

no , that son-of-a-bitch walker is alive .

you got what we need ?

is it set ?

hey , you dealt us this hand , we 're playing it all the way . move .

this is insane . the hell with the money . you radio in for that chopper , understand !

good , travers . it might catch on , like shooting skeet .

what about it ?

bring down the money or your friend 's dead !

kill me ? christ we 're partners in this !

what 's the delay ?

why did n't you send the money over ?

we should be . everybody wants what we have .

mostly . armored cars can be hijacked . trains can be derailed . but nobody can get to us in flight .

i 'd like to have a word with you . this is agent matheson , fbi .

sorry about the pain . using the gulliver to much like , eh ? giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps , eh ? you sure the pain 's gone ? you sure you 'll not be happier back up in bed .

doobidoob ... a bit tired maybe , everybody is . a long night for growing malchicks ... best not to say more . bedways is rigthways now , so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka . right , right .

we 've been working hard too . takes glass .

who are they , sir ?

yes . they want to help .

thank you , sir .

i 'm so pleased you appreciate good wine . have another glass !

try the wine !

dear , dear , dear . whatever happened to you , my boy ? mr. alexander , now confined to a wheelchair , pushes himself away from his desk , and rolls up to julian . the water drips off alex 's clothes . they look at each other .

i ... i 'm very sorry , but i never open . i 'm very sorry but i never open the door to strangers after dark .

i 'm frightfully sorry . there is a telephone in the public house about a mile down the road . i suggest you use that .

much better , thank you , sir .

missus . very pleased to meet you .

hullo .

hullo love , how are you ? nice to see you , dad .

hi . hi . hi , there my pee and em . all three look up startled .

you 've not been to school all week , son .

you try to frighten me , sir , admit so , sir . this is some new form of torture . say it , brother , sir .

what gets into you all ? we study the problem . we 've been studying it for damn well near a century , yes , but we get no further with our studies . you 've got a good home here , good loving parents , you 've got not too bad of a brain . is it some devil that crawls inside of you ?

cut out all this clever talk about milicents . just because the police have n't picked you up lately does n't , as you very well know , mean that you 've not been up to some nastiness . there was a bit of a nastiness last night , yes . some very extreme nastiness , yes . a few of a certain billyboy 's friends were ambluenced off late last night , yes . your name was mentioned , the word 's got thru to me by the usual channels . certain friends of yours were named also . oh , nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual , but i 'm warning you , little alex , being a good friend to you as always , the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself . deltoid makes a grab for alex 's joint but finds his hand instead . alex laughs . derisively and rises . deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table , and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them . he drinks from the glass . the clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes .

just a manner of speech , sir .

no time , no time , yes . sit , sit , sit . alex sits next to him .

when you say this funny feeling , you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you ?

not tonight - not this nochy .

brother , you think and talk sometimes like a little child . tonight we pull a mansize crast .

and what will you do with the big , big , money ? have you not everything you need ? if you need a motor-car , you pluck it from the trees . if you need pretty polly , you take it .

we got worried . there we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other , so around we come to your abode .

as an unmuddied lake , fred . as clear as an azure sky of deepest summer . you can rely on me , fred .

my name is frederick . as i was saying , alex , you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict . do you understand , alex ? have i made myself clear ?

mmmm , possibly . yes . but public opinion has a way of changing and you , alex , if i may call you , alex ?

hi , hi , hi there , my little droogies .

fine . absolutely fine . you see , ladies and gentlemen our subject is , you see , impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward evil . the intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress . to counter these , the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude . any questions ? priest rises and moves to alex .

no thanks , mum . it 'll pass in a minute ... ... what have you done with all my own personal things ?

how do you do , joe ? find the room comfortable , do you ? no complaints ?

aye , that 's joe . he ... ummmm , lives here now . the lodger . that 's what he is ... he ... he rents your room . alex confronts joe .

oh , aye , aye .

well , how are you then ?

keeping fit then ?

... and that ... he pulls alex 's ear , pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest .

you want to know why i did that , well you see - i do that ... he stamps on alex 's foot .

sorry , brother . i did n't mean any offence .

hello , heap of dirt . pooh , you do n't wash much do you , judging by the horrible smell .

right . halt the prisoner . good morning , sir , i 'm chief officer barnes . i 've got 655321 on a transfer from parkmoor to the ludovico centre , sir !

no , sir .

lice ?

no , sir .

blue eyes , yes , sir .

blue eyes ?

do you mean church of england ?

religion ?

pick that up and put it down properly . alex does so , and continues to empty his pockets .

yes sir .

you 've heard beethoven before ?

i just do n't understand about feeling sick the way i did . i never used to feel sick before . i used to feel like the very opposite . i mean , doing it or watching it , i used to feel real horrorshow . i just do n't understand why , how what .

it 's quite simple really . were just going to show you some films .

what exactly is the treatment here going to be then ?

we 're going to friends now , sir .

i realise all that , missus , and i 'm very grateful to all concerned .

good morning , alex , my name is dr. branom . i 'm doctor brodsky 's assistant .

i 'm sure it wo n't be long now .

and when do i get out of here then ?

it 's not that kind of a test . but you seem well on the way to a complete recovery .

excuse me , missus . no time for the old in-out , i 've just come to read the meter . slide of bird 's nest with eggs .

is n't the plumage beautiful ?

now then , each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture . you 'll tell me what you think the person would say . alright ?

no ... i 'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them alright ?

just part of hospital routine .

but , sir ... missus ... i see that it 's wrong ! it 's wrong because it 's like against like society . it 's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed .

you must take your chance boy . the choice has been all yours .

that ! ... using ludwig van like that ! he did no harm to anyone . beethoven just wrote music .

jamey mack ! be the hokey fly ! holy mother of god ! all the holy angels and blessed saints in heaven preserve us . alex breaks away but the tramp toddles alongside him .

amen . they cross themselves .

i do n't care about the danger , father . i just want to be good . i want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness .

it has not been used yet in this prison . the governor has grave doubts about it and i have heard that there are very serious dangers involved .

that 's not proven , 655321. in fact , it is only in the experimental stage at this moment .

i take it you are referring to the ludovico technique ?

no father . it 's nothing like that , father . it 's about this new thing they 're all talking about . about this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again .

indeed .

i 've done my best , have i not ?

mothballs , sir .

answer when the governor asks you a question you filthy young swine !

sir , 655321 , sir .

are you feeling better ?

we 've only just read about it in the morning papers .

shall we go to my office ?

no , no , no . that 's enough . he 's perfect . i want his records sent to me . this vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition .

cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality ... crime in the midst of punishment .

he does n't know you 're up there ! just stay right where you are ! call the police !

seventh , files section . what should i do ?

max , the cab driver !

how often you go ?

just had one .

like you , i 'm good at it . but at this exact moment in time ... like i got ta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning .

why 'd you do that ? do n't tell me you 're a gentleman , max . i thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics ...

different instrument altogether . you know , if you 'd only listened to me , we 'd be bogged down in traffic right now , and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks .

violin . i never had the lungs for wind instruments .

i used to play this piece back in high school .

no . i got lucky with the lights .

the ride is free .

you still carrying passengers ?

this your current address ?

i know the answer . i know all there is to know about louis .

lay it on me .

of course .

how do i know you 'll keep your word ?

'fraid so .

the crowd had to dig it .

get outta here ! you and louis ?

did better ' n that .

you think i wanted to come here tonight ? you think i 'm that stupid ? sometimes shit happens , you got ta roll with it .

federal ?

i think ... ... i think you should get this gun out of my fucking face .

take him down . save richard yip , our witness ...

lem me tell you something . vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts . nobody even know what he looked like until now ...

advance team , two men , stick to that goddamn cab , stay in radio contact , the rest of us follow in the van . nobody moves until the entire team 's in place ...

... petrov and cicerno for sure ...

not our call , phil .

something big 's going down , and i 'm betting the feds do n't know about it . you got ta get us in there .

oh ?

oh , right . the guy flipped out or something ? killed some people , then put a gun to his own head ?

ivan petrov . supposed to meet me for dinner , never shows up . i come here , find this .

i 'm sure you 're very proud of max .

happy to meet you , mrs. rilke .

no harm done , ma'am .

i brought you flowers .

you could n't pick up a phone ? i 'm lying here , wondering if something horrible happened ...

i 'll fuck you up , you do n't hand it over .

yo , whassup ?

jesus , what is with this guy ?

max ? maaax . pick up , dipshit .

tell it to max . tell him he 's an asshole .

i was just tryin ' to ... to ...

i give a shit whose fault it was , you 're payin ' !

it got crashed ! i did n't ...

let her go .

how do i know ? but , they all got that `` witnesses for the prosecution '' look to me . probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted ... i dunno .

and you believe me ... ?

< u > i 'm < /u > full of shit ? you 're a monument of bullshit . you even bullshitted yourself all i am , is taking out the garbage . bad guys killing bad guys ...

head towards union station .

it 's not what you owe < u > me. < /u > time is so fleeting . one day it 's gone . you make it out of this alive , max , you really should call her . that 's what i think .

i only owe you a ride , vincent .

what holds you back , max ? tell me . why does life scare you so much ?

would you have called her ?

tribeca , near the waterfront , northeast corner . twelve minutes .

you get benefits ?

in case he asks .

why ?

vincent . do n't make me do this . do n't make me get people killed .

that 's jazz , my friend . you said it yourself . so do n't tell me you do n't know how to play between the notes .

he 's gon na < u > shoot < /u > me ?

the man who hired me for this contract .

our friends in little russia . go in and ask for a man named dmitri .

in case < u > who < /u > checks ?

i 'll just hold onto it for you . in case they check .

well , this big stake 's got to be big by now . when you leaving ?

i told you i do n't like to talk about it .

what happened ?

show up for < u > what ? < /u >

teach him how to talk back , suddenly he ca n't stop . i 'm not playing .

< u > i do n't wan na know you ! < /u >

leave me alone .

god , are you always this prosaic ? you do n't learn jazz , it 's not something you 're < u > taught. < /u > it 's like breathing , like life . like us , tonight , taking what comes and going with the flow .

i 'm ... what ? sorry ?

but , hey , some good news . this last one put me way ahead of schedule . we 've actually got some time to kill . jazz ? you like jazz ?

yes , max ?

i do n't understand ...

collateral damage .

another collateral .

yeah .

so what ?

i ca n't do that . he 's the man . he 'll fire my ass .

it was an accident . you 're not liable . tell him .

who 's that ?

how ?

i should only kill people after i get to know 'em ? six billion people on the planet , you 're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy ?

how can you kill him like that ?

i did n't throw him , he fell .

play music .

oh . oh , no . you 're kidding . we ...

it 's a mess .

what are you doing ?

what ?

try harder . i 'm gon na count to three . one ...

yes ! i 'm trying , i swear !

i 'm trying ...

max . may we leave the scene of the crime now , please .

did i stutter ? the trunk . unless you want him riding up front with you ... but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go ...

you 're cool .

no-no , i-i shot him . the bullets and the fall killed him .

max ? i 'm vincent .

i 'm not a hire car . it 's against regs ?

yeah . lucky with the lights .

i do n't talk about it , you know ... no offense .

you know , this is the cleanest cab i 've ever been in . this your regular ride ?

mind if i time you ? what do i get if you 're wrong ? a free ride ?

they said send you downstairs .

guy came in with a gunshot wound , but he died of a heart attack . go figure .

drop me off here !

you turned up a one way street !

are you crazy ? !

i love her so bad . she just ... wrecks me . i would die for her .

geronimo ?

love ? love 's just a pretty way of saying , ' i want to sleep with you ' . love is bullshit .

excuse me ?

the sound of love .

shut the hell up .

flip . you 're the closest thing i got to a friend around here . tell me something . you think i 'm crazy ?

you know , flip , vietnam war was fought because of a bet howard hughes lost to aristotle onasis .

now she tells me .

do n't know , but he looks a lot more like rosie o'donnel than ben franklin .

they changed franklin 's portrait .

what about you ?

i spent two years here . this used to bring the med-cart . demerol . phenobarb . it 's jacob 's ladder .

you knew just what i was there for .

jerry ... ? < u > jerry < /u > .

i 'm sorry .

i believe you .

because he believed me .

he kept it in the side table in the front hallway . he showed me . i visited a few times . then one of jonas 's guys visited . when i arrived , your dad was dying .

to jonas . i did n't know that at the time . did n't know who he was . but i knew inside , whoever he was , he 'd send someone else . so i started watching your father . i wanted to keep him safe .

back where ?

yeah . i know what it 's like .

then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box ?

what about them ?

this way .

not today .

answer me . was the first time you saw me the first time i saw you ? was it ? you 've been following me around . do you see how that could be disconcerting to me ? that 's not love , jerry . it 's obsession . and it is n't normal and you ca n't expect me to respond to it and you ca n't expect me to feel the same way . can you ?

jerry , i --

i like you , jerry . a lot .

those are song lyrics , jerry .

they do n't break in the summer ! do you know what building is right over this spot ? harriman tower . their sub-basement was flooded ! he did n't die in a pool . call the coroner in rhode island ! ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated !

they 're big details , jerry .

nobody dies in newport . they could n't even kill sunny von bulow there . harriman drowned , but it was n't in newport .

right here in manhattan .

murdered ?

so now they feed us terrorists . < u > to create fear < /u > . how much do you think an airport security system goes for ? then multiply it by every airport in the country .

cold war 's over , jerry .

they 're dead . four out of five anyhow . all in the last 24 hours . one car accident , two heart attacks and a stroke .

you have n't been bothering them , have you ?

i put an ad on a computer bulletin board . i log on at the library so i ca n't be traced .

is he dead ?

just a guy trying to put out a fire .

has this happened to you before ?

i 've never read it . i just -- every time i see one i buy it . i do n't know why exactly ... wan na hear my favorite part ?

yeah ... how many subscribers do you have ?

'on july 8 , 1979 , security forces under control of the trilateral commission abducted the fathers of all american nobel prize winners . the men , many of them octogenarians , were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles . the sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the rand corporation in santa monica , california . '

you want something to drink ?

you okay ?

i 'm not sure . i think i figured something out . it must 've been in my newsletter .

and look here . cease fire in chechenia . that 's good for the banks who lent the government money , but bad for the guys selling them weapons . listen to this , some gas company in colorado . their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive . they 've accused the e.p.a . of , quote , 'turning a blind < u > eye < /u > to the future . '

what is it with you and the space program ?

see ? was n't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans ?

change lanes . then watch your rearview .

right . sit up so i can see you .

that 's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out . a lot of people are after you , jerry .

< u > heart attacks happen < /u > .

you expect me to believe what , that someone came in here last night . gave that guy ... something that stopped his heart ?

hey ... i ca n't control it . it 's just , something that happened .

switch 'em . or i 'll be dead by morning . do n't want to be dead .

you were there , jerry . figure it out .

put down the gun and i 'll take your statement . okay ?

you bit someone 's nose off ?

what was your horse 's name ?

you think i 'm crazy .

do you still ride ?

testing some top secret seismic weapon .

liza sutton is dead .

who have you been talking to , jerry ? who else knows what you know ?

then screw you . i 'll rot .

i do n't know ...

we got someone watching her 24 hours a day . she --

you made your decision yet ?

it 's okay . i 'm game .

walters had nothing to do with your father 's murder .

belief is immaterial . what 's important is the truth ... it 's been my job to find jerry . i 'm very much responsible for him .

jerry is dangerous . jerry has killed --

yes , that 's right .

it was . it was .

terminal ?

i am impressed . we used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card .

a vulgar pop term , but yes . take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin . that was our goal .

fine . what the hell is going on ?

re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society . making sure the men who 've gone over the edge wo n't hurt anyone . that sort of thing .

only on the football field .

that 's it . i went to yale . i hope you wo n't hold that against me .

a charming term . now , < u > why him < /u > ?

here 's a fresh one . why you ? your colleague mr. wilson says jerry wo n't speak to anyone else . that seems oddly possessive behavior to me .

you 've asked me that one three times .

do you < u > have < /u > an agent lowry in your new york office ?

-- understood .

i 've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face , liza . what i saw yesterday , i know not to ask questions . we 're out . shut off . terminated . < u > understood < /u > ?

i 've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to jerry fletcher . we 're not to discuss him with the press , the n.y.p.d. , anyone . building police are to arrest him on sight and we 're to report any attempt he makes to contact you .

not today ...

ah , your psychotic is here .

what do you mean ?

yeah , i do .

i was just thinking that .

that 's the book hinkley had on him when he shot reagan .

there 's no plug to pull .

you do n't believe it to be ... tell me something , doctor . why do you think they would go to all this trouble ... bring you tens of thousands of light years , and then send you home without a shred of proof ? sort of bad form , would n't you say ? what was their intent ?

is it possible ... ?

yes , sir .

yes , sir .

nothing . okay . some of us have been a little ... not concerned , exactly , but ...

glad to have you , david . how 's the new office ?

now i remember why i went into theoretical work . kent .

good luck , david .

you are n't staying ?

maybe they are . maybe this is all part of the package . the building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale . maybe requiring us to come together in this way was , in effect , part of the plan .

... i ca n't believe they would n't take something as basic as our biological needs into account ...

you ...

what ?

actually i 'm running late --

interesting analogy . and how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in africa ?

ms. president , this is communist paranoia right out of war of the worlds . there is no reason whatsoever to believe the etis intentions are hostile . we pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in africa .

ellie --

with me .

you must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already ...

... could it be a nested code of some sort ?

if it 's attention you want i 'd say you 've got it . just one thing : why vega ? everyone 's looked at vega for years with no results , and now , yesterday , they start broadcasting primes . why ?

the difference being what -- that i refuse to adopt the standard line , that i do n't care about the results of my work ? well , i do care . of course any discovery has to be verifiable , of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method , but i refuse to go around pretending i 'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it 's obvious to anyone with a brain i 'm just not .

the point is , this is n't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it 's turned into some kind of personal obsession .

no doubt .

no , thanks .

what if you 're wrong ? no -- i 'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you ca n't deny the possibility -- and i believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly ... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks .

and only two probabilities : one : there is intelligent life in the universe but they 're so far away you 'll never contact it in your lifetime --

i 'm sorry , miss arroway , not only is it too speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation , at this point in your career it 'd be tantamount to suicide .

what 's the status of the decryption effort ?

it could be anything . the first volume of some encyclopedia galactica ...

what does it say ?

i do n't know . maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere , but if there is , i sure as hell ca n't find it .

we 've repeated . a few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one .

analyzing signal polarization shifts .

how 's the spying tonight , guys ?

i scanned it at arecibo ; negative results , always .

got a bogey , boss ?

vb10 's an m dwarf ; signa draconis ... too old .

i think we just hit the cosmic jackpot .

ca n't we get rid of them ?

thank you , mr. sensitive . i 'm coming at this wrong ... missing something ... something ...

this is how you see the sky ?

here , right around centaurus a .

1919+21 . found a glitch in the timing ; probably a starquake .

ellie . pulsar ?

kent , kent for chrissakes . you must be eleanor .

is it possible . yes . but --

in fact , by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible .

is that your official response ?

pardon me , but you ca n't do -- !

and a hundred mile airspace .

i 'm saying you might have consulted us ; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive ...

this is n't a person to person call , mr. kitz . i do n't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for americans .

childhood is over , ellie . it 's time to grow up .

ellie ... this is the way it 's been done for billions of years ...

that is n't the way it works .

eventually you 'll get here on your own . this was just the first step ; in time you 'll take another .

can you help us ?

you have your mother 's hands ... there are no tests , ellie . we do n't sit in judgment . think of us more as ... librarians . curators of the universe 's rarest and most valuable creation ...

many others .

you contacted us . we were simply listening . we 've been listening for millions of years .

am i artifact or dream ? you might ask that about anything .

could we hear to china ?

but what do i say ?

try again between the static and 'hey jude ' ; that 's where they 're hiding .

-- of hadden industries .

the systems integration site .

would n't you if you saw hitler on tv ? come ; i want to show you something .

the gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us .

oh , not quite yet . at least for their sake ... ... i hope it 's not . because they 're running out of time .

in return ... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game . do we have a deal ?

that 's my girl ... lights .

perhaps . but on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device ' of some kind , i plan to be very far away from your lovely texas when it is activated .

i 'd say this is slightly different .

what day ?

peter , what are you talking about ? what malfunction ? what day is this ?

that you , valerian ?

it 's really happening .

it 's good to see you , ellie .

ellie -- i 'm getting married . her name 's laura . she came up to owens valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left .

i 'm serious about this , peter --

right now -- we 'll drive down to ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us .

and you think i do n't want those things ? you think i do n't stay up half the night wondering if i 've made the right choice living half a world away from you , wondering if any of this is worth what i 'm giving up for it everyday ? let 's get married .

but the work --

what if i said i could get drumlin to agree to sell you time in new mexico ?

if we lived at any previous time in human history we would n't even have the option of failing -- we 'd have to wonder our whole lives , unable to do anything about it . this time , right now , is unique in our history , in any civilization 's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology . the moment when contact becomes possible . we 've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now .

... we 've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck ; got a donation from a new york dowager ... we 've even been thinking about selling t-shirts .

any luck on the grant money ?

... i 'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things i care about ! or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like drumlin , when if they 'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts ...

keep it down , okay ? drumlin thinks i 'm enough of a flake as it is . look -- everyone here has their little fetishes . caven goes to topless bars , vernon 's got his carnivorous plants ... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence .

yavol .

ellie . arroway .

that 's what they all say .

something my dad -- they -- said . 'after all the suffering , after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other . ' the one thing that makes it bearable is love .

i do n't know . if it was a god , it was searching for a greater one . it was still searching for meaning ...

ellie ... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced did n't actually happen -- i 'm afraid they really will crucify you . please . for your own sake , for the sake of the world ... tell them what you know to be the truth . tell them it really happened .

it also makes god enormous . i think of the scope of your universe , ellie ... and it takes my breath away . as it will everyone else 's .

they do n't believe me .

hi .

what are my other options ? in fifty years ? never ?

maybe that 's okay .

i do seem to be ... maybe because i 'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow .

what if their answer is , 'oh , that 's easy . a thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape , our population out of control , violent crime , no food ... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social . the weak . the sick . the unwanted . and ever since we 've been doing great . '

how do you mean ?

it 's getting late ...

and yet you 're willing to die for this cause , the one thing that 's given your life a sense of purpose . do n't you see the contradiction here -- ?

and everybody you care about would be dead and buried .

it 's too ... elegant . the degree of economy is extraordinary ; it 's really the next logical step ... even on earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature . d.n.a . outclasses any computer we can come up with ; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable .

not exactly . it has organic qualities , but we do n't really understand how they 're integrated with the mechanical systems .

i was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors .

so . is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this ?

and there 's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it ?

and mind , yes . what are you --

'my father 's house has many mansions . '

spoken like a true believer .

... what i 'm curious about are the wilderness years . you 're out there all alone , no money , mocked by the skeptics . it must have taken tremendous faith .

make that two .

i 'd have to say i do n't know enough to have one yet . for the moment i do n't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive .

i agree with mr. rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but i do n't think it justifies taking an alarmist position . dr. arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one , and a scientific approach is probably appropriate , at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent .

i guess i 'd say i trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of , thanks for the advice , but no thanks . but to dilute or censor the truth , for whatever reason --

call it xenophobic paranoia . do n't you see the absolute absurdity of this ? this is n't about them , it 's about us -- our violence , our fear and mistrust --

it 's designed purely as a defensive device . call it a reasonable precaution .

you have a question , dr. arroway ?

have your department make a full report .

but i made this arrangement --

you never wanted to live forever anyways , did you ? it was n't such a hell of a life .

we call it abuildin ' time , arletta .

you never thought that 's a heavy load ?

sometimes i wisht people was like dogs , luke . comes a time , a day like , when the bitch just do n't recognize her pups no more , so she do n't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain . she just do n't give a damn . they let you smoke ?

helen , she sent along your things with a note , and john here , he wrote to the police .

he 's probably a gigolo .

you steal a car ?

ram it in and break it off !

got ta have kings .

lookit her bounce .

you cut that up fer lunch , luke .

yes sir , boss paul !

git to work !

please ! please !

what 's all this dirt in the yard ?

comin ' out here , boss ?

cuttin ' the heads off parkin ' meters , captain .

maliciously destroyin ' municipal property while under the influence . what was that ?

borrowin ' .

only two ? man , i already done eight . nothin ' to it . just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves .

had it done in singapore . bunch of us drunk as coots --

you was to sell your job , maybe this lucas war hero would give you a price .

in the navy , we used to call guys --

well -- - okay . it 's a deal . one cold drink , if ' n you please . in advance . one chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand ... that goes for the rest of you mullet-heads , too .

a cold drink ? okay ?

get away !

he ai n't eating beans fer lunch .

i call .

drag 's been chain-ganging so long he 's got a nose like a bloodhound .

tramp ! beautiful !

you got ta mind your manners , you actin ' like a hillbilly tramp .

why sure , luke . i mean i did n't talk to them about that . but why not ? they 're reasonable , luke . hell , we only been gone a coupla hours .

luke , are you alright ? ... they got us , boy . they 're out there thicker ' n flies . bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than i ever seen in my life . we do n't have a chance , luke ... they caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin ' to kill you , luke . but i got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful , they would n't even whip you this time .

but what am i gon na do all by myself ? oh if ' n i had n't lost mah head . i only had two more years to go . but when i saw you tearin ' down with that truck ... but you right luke . we oughta split up . be safer for us both .

nothin ' to worry about . we got a deadlock on that mullet .

why 'd you have to say fifty ? why not thirty-five or thirty-nine ?

that 's it . that 's the end .

whatta you mean , forget it ?

man , this here newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself luke do n't know nuthin ' 'bout nuthin ' .

i thought you knew , boy ... they sentenced me by the mile .

course not . he ai n't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him . he 's there 'cause he back sassed a free man . they got their rules and we ai n't got nothing to do with that . woulda probably happened to him sooner or later , to a complainer like him . he 's got ta learn the rules same as anybody else .

i just always did like truck rides .

whatta you so happy about ?

well , you know . small town , not much to do in the evenings . mostly it was settling up old scores .

somebody say somethin ' ?

thirty-nine ... forty ... forty-one ... forty-two ...

you ever see mah boy throw up ? shut your mouth and put up your money !

koko , write down their names , do n't just make marks .

cuter .

i got ta believe . out ! now they 're rollin ' . king-five-four gets an eight . pair ' a nines with a jack gets a four . ninas still up .

man , it 's so hot .

a phoney ? whatta you mean , a phoney ?

yeah , found one in this supermarket , keys in the ignition .

but you 're dog enough . maybe they 'll let you sleep outside the box near your master .

no . no chains either .

i do n't see no sign of guts in you .

oh for ...

you ca n't switch 'round jobs , anyway . i figured he knew that .

it 's good medicine .

hal has it .

where have you < u > been < /u > ? what happened to your wallet ?

but < /u > alive < /u > !

it 's almost six . and guess what ? hall likes me bathed and shaved .

about what ?

reminded me that i used to be attractive . that men used to want me ...

no , dear . you 're at your best with a bag in front of your face .

monsieur andy , disapproves of my coiffure ?

i 've told you : i ca n't afford to garage it .

well ! are n't we the daring one ? what 's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make doctor helen set foot outside her door ? the antenna is gone off her car again . i had no music , all the way to the market . let me find a garage for it ?

would you please get your hands off my face , tallulah ? what happened to the newspaper ?

where were you ? do n't tell me . it 's just under seventy , right ? the sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh ...

tell her we 're sorry we bothered her .

you talked to me . do you remember ?

when he was seventeen .

he took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong . he was not acting on mad impulse . he was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time .

you said , first , he was lying . how do you know that , doctor ?

you already made the delivery ?

the door was open , swear to god , i 'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs ...

damn ! i gave that to conrad , too ! that guy ! i told conrad deliver to kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you .

you come and visit .

i think whatever is best for you , daryll . and maybe you 're right , that 's the place .

do anything you want to me . i give myself to you . only put the knife down . is n't this what you always wanted ? i know it 's what we all want , to love and to loved . i could love you . you could work together in some safe place , learn to really understand you , help you , give you some peace of mind , some happiness ...

oh , please . i know what 's coming , now . `` let me help you ... ''

why ca n't i drive home ? i will . you . look at you . < u > you < /u > need a ride home . and you do n't even know it .

i am not going to talk about it . how do you < u > know < /u > it was andy if the head was gone ? where is the head ? are you looking for it ? oh , god , why him ? because of me . i ca n't talk about it . i write about things like this , stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries . this is the first person close to me who 's ever died . and it 's because of me . this monster killed him because i loved him .

a man ? i thought he was a boy . this last christmas was the happiest christmas i had in the last ten years ... you know why ? it was the first christmas in six years i was not in love . son of a bitch < u > married men < /u > ! who cares about marriage , the bed just gets crowded and noisy ? !

they were n't going to show it to me ? ! the arrogance ! it 's my < u > life < /u > !

one of those goddamned car alarms . what 's going ...

because i 'm all you 've got .

that 's not consistent ... you said they never changed their style , they 're robots ...

he comes in the window , we maybe grab him . where 's the on-switch ?

i turned it off . it 's like an open window he can climb right in ...

she was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot . where it says `` no dumping . '' her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose . it 's all different but it seems so -- the same . artificial and < u > posed < /u > ... something 's wrong with it .

nobody knows you have anything to do with this case ; nothing has been on tv or the news ... why would he want to get in < u > your < /u > computer ?

maybe that 's why you ca n't catch him . i < u > know < /u > what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer .

one officer already got killed trying to protect me . please , just take it all away . leave me alone .

it was a lover or a husband . someone close . somebody who knew her and cared about her .

you ca n't go out lecturing ? tough shit . women are dying . where can i lay this stuff out ?

will you go . andy , make them go .

well , let 's thank god you and inspector goetz are on the case , then .

sugar and cream for goetz ; i take mine black . you 're absolutely correct . the politicians do n't want panic headlines spoiling the festival of love .

< u > you < /u > called < u > us < /u > , doctor hudson .

i think this is number three ...

you 're calling me a crank ?

what else ?

is there a phone booth there ?

listen to me . is there a gas station nearby ?

the lock ...

in the sixties . he 's dead -- stabbed to death in prison .

he 's got sergeant halloran in there . he 'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people ...

she is a writer , writing best selling books about serial killing . giving lectures she 's well-paid for . her interests are not the interests of law enforcement .

over here .

you touch anything , mike ? pick up anything ? use the doorknob ? i do n't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me .

michael johnson .

i 'm over here ? what 's your name , officer ?

i was .

you 're in terrible trouble , nikko .

if this is just the dump site , where did he do the job ? where did he pick her up ?

god , you 're cute when you 're mad .

yeah , you did that too . you earned what you got ; do n't shit on it , that 's all i 'm saying .

do n't put yourself down like that . i < u > never < /u > used you . i worked my way up like a marine grunt !

yeah . and you used that . used < u > me < /u >

i got ta get something to eat , i have n't eaten all day .

what 's abba ?

the woman 's unstable . you could wind up with a harassment charge . < u > anything < /u > . you 're like some horny little teenager .

you damn well better start working on that impulse control . a woman who is implicated in this case ? someone who 's practically a piece of < u > evidence < /u > ?

yeah , everything 's different .

spread out like she was sexually assaulted here .

look at her legs .

she 's blue as hell . no marks on her neck . asphyxiated ? not the same -- no ligature marks . outdoors ...

what about her arms ?

you said you do n't give a fuck and that 's the beauty of a breakdown ? this does n't look like not giving a fuck , you know that ?

tell it to your shrink .

sure . she likes < u > you < /u > , rube . she likes the way you move . she sure as hell is n't in love with me .

classy madonna .

answer it .

my third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that .

i 'm gon na drop charges on the break-and-enter at hudson 's ...

you got a suspect ...

just , i need results . and -- i am short-handed . who else am i gon na give him ?

if this is a first step in kicking me off the case , just tell me , to my face , sir , do n't waste time being diplomatic .

where you going ?

okay , now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective ? what the hell is going on ? you got no discipline in your operation .

do n't swear at me because we got problems . i 'm just giving you the news . i went to a catholic school ; i 'll tell you what they teach . on the knuckles they teach .

yessir . i have reflected on that , sir . which explains my gushing deference to you , sir .

would you step outside , sergeant ?

this is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a festival of love . the mayor and chamber of commerce do n't want tv announcing killers on the loose .

he 's not treating her right ...

yes , i fed her . if she says she 's hungry , she 's lying to you . again .

one of your suitors ?

i was n't driving . i 'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport . could it have been deliberate ?

they 're questioning vaughan about an accident near the airport . some pedestrian ... they think he was run over intentionally .

have you seen his penis ?

no . but when he 's in that car ...

it does .

you 're not envious ?

i 'm amazed that she 'll let you drive her .

i ca n't sit on this balcony forever . i 'm beginning to feel like a potted plant .

i wish i had . they bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months .

it is ?

it 's about time .

the sergeant asked me to identify it . he did n't believe you 'd gotten out alive .

i 'll listen for you buzzing over .

not a lot of action here .

yes . i did n't plan it that way .

and you had sex with all of these men in cars ? only in cars ?

do you want a cigarette ? i started to smoke at the hospital . it 's rather stupid of me .

it 's not here . maybe the police are still holding it . their forensic people ...

after this sort of thing , how do people manage to look at a car , let alone drive one ? i 'm trying to find charles 's car .

no , thanks . i 'll go with vaughan .

there 's still a patch of blood there on the road . did you see it ?

i 'm sure the police would make an exception in your case .

no .

are we allowed to park here ?

it 's the future , ballard , and you 're already part of it . for the first time , a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us . for example , the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form . to fully understand that , and to live that ... that is my project .

it 's very ... satisfying . i 'm not sure i understand why .

is that why you drive this car ? i take it that you see kennedy 's assassination as a special kind of car-crash ?

no , i mean a crash with a history . camus ' facel vega , or nathaniel nest 's station wagon , grace kelly 's rover 3500. fix it just enough to get it rolling . do n't clean it , do n't touch anything else .

you could get your wish at any moment .

i 've always wanted to drive a crashed car .

it 's something we 're all intimately involved in : the reshaping of the human body by modern technology .

it was just a little going-away gesture .

so , we 'll meet every tuesday and friday . and if you have any kind of emergency , you can page me .

i think it 's about that time , letty . the charges against you have been dropped , the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well .

look , i know he 's almost through with treatment here . and , he 's on medication .

i do n't need a lecture . i care about michael .

what about michael ? do you know the extent of his ...

i 'm a grown woman , dr. emlee . i can take care of myself .

the medicine 's still bothering me . it feels like i have cotton wrapped around my brain .

this doctor , was he tall , with dark hair ?

i ca n't . i ca n't see him there .

i do n't think people even noticed . i thought the ceremony was perfect .

what 's his name , letty ?

do we have to talk wedding details ?

mom and i fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white .

that settles it . i 'm never leaving .

what 's the matter ?

what about the souffle ? has that gone in ?

what about this one ?

what about the engagement party ?

what do you think of this one ?

where 's the old bag i sometimes call mommy ?

really ?

how ?

there 's nothing to tell .

just go ahead and tell us .

i will , dear . i promise . why mcdonald 's ?

michael just got a job . could n't you congratulate him ?

i 've already made arrangements .

i 'm so thankful you 'll be leaving next week . if you want me to pick you up , i will .

it 's good exercise , mom .

must you walk so quickly ?

and if i want to smoke , i 'll fucking smoke .

do n't forget that paul 's a promising young attorney who loves you very much ...

i hear this michael fellow is schizophrenic .

we have n't . i wanted to talk that over with you , too .

which flowers did you order ?

tomorrow ?

i 'm so glad to see you . you ca n't believe the people in here . they 've got patients posing as doctors ...

mom , i was there , and i just , i was so ... they did n't have the olives , and i , i got so upset . i do n't know how it happened .

are you sure , dear ?

i 'll be running it three days a week , and ...

you can only do what feels best to you now .

to talk ? well , ok , that might be good .

it had this red spot on its back .

i 'm really not that hungry .

you should go .

i will . and you make sure you take care of yourself .

oh , god , michael , i know . why does everything have to be so hard ?

letty , please .

it 's hard to know where to start .

silly , silly , silly .

why 'd you tell ?

we both talked to her , michael . and your dad .

bye , uncle cort . what 's with the lie ?

aunt lily ?

you do n't have to take care of me , you know .

that 's ok. we can call and reschedule in the morning .

big restaurant interview tomorrow .

who ever said sanity was fun ?

sounds grim .

that 's mr. beast to you .

i 'll see you tonight .

not yet .

you 're so wrong .

i like it . but headlines are better .

how can you not like the top 10 list ?

out ? are you kidding ? i 've got all the fixings here .

really ?

do you like it ?

very trendy . let 's see the rest .

you like it ?

and did you go to the mission ?

but i do . i love you , too .

i do n't like lamb .

i 'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together . and we 'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper .

what else would you do ?

that 's where i always go when i get out .

my grandma rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil , and they grow right up to the sun , tall and straight . other trees , they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light . but even though they end up crooked , they 're still trees , just like the straight ones .

shocking , huh ?

really , though . my thoughts go haywire sometimes .

back-to-back sessions with the shrink .

a daisy for the lady .

rendezvous at the closet in 30 .

exactly .

no .

i wo n't do your portion of kitchen cleanup .

good god .

enough with the abracadabra .

it was romantic . he 's very romantic .

was it bad news -- the visit from peter ?

you missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner .

i 'm not the one who 's masquerading as a doctor . i 'm not the one who 's , who 's ...

stop acting like you 're someone special . you 're just like the rest of us .

you took bets on my diagnosis ?

yes ? go right ahead .

what about patterns ? do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks ? or washing your hands over and over again ?

i know this can be a real drag , but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night .

letty .

michael . yes .

what ?

oh .

of all the crazy things . i understood when you dropped out of law school . and during this whole mess , i 've tried to be supportive . but , really , letty , what can you be thinking ?

he 's a patient here .

i need to tell you something , and i 'm not sure how .

sure . we 'll save the formal announcement for when you 're out . i already told your mother . i hope you do n't mind .

you do n't have to say anything else . i 've known for a while that this was coming .

especially now .

especially this last year .

it 's prettier here than i thought it would be .

sure . why ?

yes .

you just need to get more organized . l

yeah .

no , i ca n't . i 've already convinced both mom and dad to come .

you do n't have a fever .

what are you doing ? you 're going to be late .

sure . of course .

or , of course , you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year .

i 've already thought about how to tell the kids where i was .

i know , letty . but the incident with zach was frightening for the children . now if you 'd come to me , explained what was going on ...

look , gail , i 've been a good teacher .

well , i understand . i know my behavior was poor .

you did n't have to kill sophie .

and you 're a dirty cop . at least i do n't pretend to be something different than what i am .

when this is over you can say whatever the hell you want . i 'll be long gone . besides , who 's going to believe you ? you 're just a two-bit crook .

no . i have it . the lamp ? the one with your fingerprints and her blood on it ? remember ?

no . you killed her . manager remembers you going into her room . your fingerprints were found all over the place .

you killed her !

then we just have to make sure everyone who knows ca n't say anything .

what for ? the minute i get him some other gavone will take his place . i 've been doing this for twenty years . when i retire it 's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs .

i swear man , i do n't know . they packed up and left a half hour ago . all i got is one of their phone numbers in paris .

jesus . what kind of fbi agent are you ?

what ? this ?

take what you 've got and get out of there .

my number 's going to show up on his bill !

i do n't have it . that 's why vincent went to chicago . they arrested him before he could bring it back .

do n't bullshit me , laurant ! i know about the van gogh .

a million ! i do n't have that kind of money .

you do n't trust me ?

i thought i would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage ... and tell you that marcel will be going with you .

where 's your brother ?

to tell you that we 're interested in the property .

i 'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills .

okay . i understand you 're interested in one of our properties ?

when you return please extend my regards to mr. maranzano and his family .

we 're doing everything we can to find these people . right tony ?

why did n't you tell me about this ?

angelo , we live and die by the rules we make . we are men of honor , but honor without respect is a ... horse-less carriage .

but you were there ?

i did . joey `` two tons '' and nicky `` the rake '' did the deed .

your own brother ? you could n't send someone else to do it ?

you know , i 'm kind of tired . i 'm just gon na go home if it 's all the same to you .

i only ask so i can call you when the arrangements are made .

i just want to get my people home . i know who you are and what you could do to me if i do n't honor my word .

i only have your word for that .

half the tapes .

we 've got a lot of people looking for us . we 'd just like to go home .

i 've got to tell you , mr. bonanno , this guy 's an idiot . how he 's lived this long is a mystery .

you rob an associate of mine ... a friend and --

i guess we 're going to find out .

for what ?

if you think because you 're a women this ca n't go hard on you , think again .

i 'm not any closer than you are .

because you 're the closest .

get that , will you ?

why not just steal another one ?

i agree with marcel . i say we go to the airport and get on a plane .

not a good idea . someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you . raymond , you 'll steal one .

and be careful when you get near the top . zero has a very long one .

we are being watched . daniel grabs the binoculars and looks .

we are tired and bored with your bullshit . so , put that stupid little knife away before zero shoves it up your ass .

we 'll see .

where are you from ?

in english . sami does n't speak french .

sami , tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us .

maybe if we gave the tapes back --

we had a chance to walk out of zammito 's house .

what is that a threat ? are you fuckin ' threatening me , marcel ?

no .

you know , if you could get your nose out of bastaldi 's ass for two seconds you might see what 's going on around you .

it was an honest mistake . ridgeway ... ridgeroad ... ridgeway road .

if they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back . that would have left us with nothing .

hey , who warned you that they were coming up to the room ?

he 's been shot a lot . he 's used to it .

what 's he joking around for ? he 's been shot .

hello ?

okay . airports , train stations , bus station are out . we know they 're connected to the car rental agencies because that 's where they picked up raymond .

it 's not your fault , daniel .

i think he 'd cut his dick off if bastaldi told him to .

we have to find sophie .

what 's the big deal ? it 's not like i was on guard duty or something .

okay , we 're square now , right ?

there 's ten grand in here . it 's yours . i 'm going to call you again . there 's one more thing i need you to do .

and , uh , i 'm going to have to charge you a commission ... kind of like a brokerage fee .

yeah , i 'd be from belgium too if i was you . you know zammito just put his own brother in the hospital ? broke his arm cause he was late on a debt . i mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin ' for you .

what do you want now ?

tell me the truth hector ... do you think we 'll find my car ?

he told enrique he did n't know anything about his car .

-- do n't think . okay ? you 're not good at it .

good song though .

can you believe that guy ? what a moron .

you did n't say find them . you said , `` get them . ''

okay boss . where are they ?

boy , you must be pissed .

everything .

what 'd they take ?

the holiday hotel .

yeah . i 'll come down and make a full confession later . right now , tell me what else you found ?

some french guy . at least that 's what his passport said . you know joey , i should n't be talking to you about this .

and the other car ?

dead bodies . the ones in the lincoln are your ... associates .

go where ? the police are outside .

what do we do ?

i 'm telling you i 've pulled out everything in the safe . there are n't any jewels .

there has to be .

no . 145 ridgeroad way .

bastaldi got the address from you , yes ?

we 've got to get out of here .

do n't tell me to be cool ! we were supposed to be in and out . in and out ! in the last twenty four hours we 've managed to get the mafia ... the fbi ... the chicago police department and a group of latin gang members after us . i have n't left out anyone , have i ? i do n't think so , because we 've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin ' city !

hey , it 's not your picture on the tv , it 's mine . so , try to be cool .

i knew this was a mistake ! i knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this . i could hear that little voice in my head saying , `` do n't do it ! do n't you do it ! '' jesus , why do n't i ever listen to myself ?

c'mon , get real , will you . you think he 's just going to forget about this ? these guys are all about respect . all about honor . he 's coming after us , so we might as well take the money .

what is it you do , sami ?

what are we going to do , take a taxi ?

how about canada ?

no . how much ?

there 's no reason to be abusive . you 're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism .

god , i want to go home .

it 's good .

mr. taylor ?

okay . you can be elvis .

it 's my idea .

i 've still got a few legal problems back in the states .

i said a clean break .

i 'm telling you that 's my car ! and someone 's gon na pay for it !

no shit ?

you see that car ?

how ?

i am raymond . thank you for allowing us to stay here .

glenmorangie is very good .

glenmorangie .

i say we make him pay first . after that you can do whatever you want to him .

julien , what you 're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress . you 're projecting your anger onto us .

it 's simple . bastaldi 's moving up . he 's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us .

i said knock it off ! now as far as i 'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over , but right now we 've got to figure out what 's going on .

what ?

oh , you think ?

feel free to correct him if you want .

what does arresting us get them ?

they send us to zammito 's house . the fbi is right across the street watching the whole thing , but they do n't move . a crime is going down and they do n't move . why ? because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us .

zero did not put it in his bag . he put it in yours .

stick around and find out .

it 's three in the morning . not much else to do .

i 've been thinking about getting tattoo . you know , a flower or something . on my ass .

sorry . i did n't mean to pry .

you got it in a bar ?

it looks old . did you get it a long time ago ?

just lucky i guess . how 'd you start working for the bastaldi 's ?

it belongs to vincent bastaldi . he left it last time he was here . i 'm sure he would n't mind if you used it .

you ever hear of jet lag ?

i was n't expecting this many of you . i 've got a few sleeping bags you can use .

okay . okay .

yeah . i mean besides that . they treating you all right ? food okay ?

you broke my arm . how the hell do you think i 'm doin ' ?

she seems pleasant enough .

well , li mu bai can do it .

li mu bai is coming to stay the night .

pardon me , but i doubt you can handle her . my wife was quite a martial arts expert . jade fox killed her . so you see , this is personal . leave her to me .

yes .

why were you spying on the yus ?

who are you ?

i 've always wanted a disciple worthy of wudan 's secrets .

why should i ? you need practice . i can teach you to fight with the green destiny , but first you must learn to hold it in stillness .

stop talking like a monk ! just fight !

i do as i please .

let 's go !

tell me , who is your master ?

what 's it to you ?

you would n't have understood , even if i had tried to explain . you know ... you 've gone as far as you can go . i hid my skills so as not to hurt you .

in that case , perhaps we could be of assistance .

do n't invite danger into your father 's house .

put them down .

i 've made you silk pajamas . do you want to change into them ?

take my horse and go to the compound . give this to mrs. wu . she 'll help you . hurry !

she used purple yin ... purple yin poison . it goes straight to the heart .

how dare you accuse us ? i always knew you had stolen the sword ! i 've done nothing but protect you and your family . and you 're repaid me with nothing but contempt . li mu bai himself spared you , and all you do is insult him . we wanted some peace and you 've ruined it all ! you 're no sister of mine !

you know about lo ?

you , sister ...

i 'm just borrowing some clean clothes . i 'm not staying .

i am not an aristocrat , as you are ... but i must still respect a woman 's duties .

too bad for meng , but it 's not your fault , or li mu bai 's .

about you and li mu bai ?

how so ?

writers would n't sell many books if they told how it really is .

it must be exciting to be a fighter , to be totally free !

yes , i am . but i prefer the machete . certain moves , however , call for a sword .

you 're a sword fighter too ?

you 're too young to understand .

but i have had much practice . as a child in the west , a platoon lived with us . they 'd let me play with their weapons . the scabbard is so beautiful .

the antidote exists . she taught it to me . the formula is simple , but it takes time to prepare . trust me . as you have helped me , let me help you .

it is trouble for me .

out here , you always fight for survival . you have to be part of a gang to stand a chance . slowly , your gang becomes your family . all that dark cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier .

when i was a boy , one night , i saw a thousand shooting stars . i thought , where did they all go ? i 'm an orphan . i used to look for stars alone . i thought if i rode to the other end of the desert , i 'd find them . i 've been riding in the desert ever since .

i 'm sorry ... i guessed wrong . i though you were a han .

it 's mine . it means a lot to me . a barbarian like you would n't understand .

still in a bad mood ? at least you 're speaking . what 's your name ?

let 's stop a moment .

shu lien ...

my blood will soon reverse its flow . it 's the same poison she used to kill my master . there is no antidote .

what happened ?

not a bad idea . tonight we 'll get a good night 's sleep at headquarters .

your hand , rough and callused from machete practice ... all this time , i 've never had the courage to touch it .

do n't you want to see her again .

i knew she would intrigue you .

that 's not what i meant . i do n't care about the sword .

be careful . sir te requires discretion . official business is difficult enough . do n't let personal feelings make it worse . and i do n't know ... even this poster ... could be some sort of trap .

you always suspected she 'd fled to the west .

what have you discovered ?

first i must visit my master 's grave . it 's been many years since jade fox murdered him . i have yet to avenge his death . and yet i 'm thinking of quitting . i must pray for his forgiveness .

we 're preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking .

the mountain must be so peaceful ... i envy you . my work keeps me so busy , i hardly get any rest .

a female criminal ! now that 's news !

but do n't be too lenient .

i 'm sorry she 's not feeling well enough to receive you today .

we must avenge mother !

the best way to trap a fox is through her cubs .

what in the hell ... do you call that ?

they make you fart .

talent . hi .

do n't thank me .

double homicide . a year ago . las halloween .

the hell you say . this is n't just about you any more .

it 's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds .

it 's only a flesh wound .

you went out the window . she was beaten and raped . she died in the hospital .

fucking a , my friend .

are you nuts , walking into a gun ?

no further . i 'm serious .

it ca n't rain all the time .

i think he 's yours , now .

she 's dead . she 's gone . and now you 're just gon na go away and never come back , too . i hate this place ; it is n't fair .

you got ta go now , i bet .

mister funboy lives there ?

mom tried to cook .

you cut her . you raped her . you watched !

little early from trick-or-treat , homie . this dick trying to bushwack me .

i never forget anything , dickhead . that building was a sweep-and- clear ; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition . it got a little rowdy ... end of story .

it 's yesterday ! do you know what you destroyed ?

top dollar , you 're the only one here still wasting good air ...

top dollar .

i wish to possess what you have now .

how the hell did you do that ?

tell me i 'll get hurt . that i might die . i 've already done that . i do n't need anyone 's help . yours included .

shut up .

getting a little ambitious and extracurricular , are n't we ?

miss her ?

what 's this -- a little , ah , bloodstain , right ? fifty bucks for the box , and i 'm doin ' you a --

coupla more rings ... 24k .

whoa , hey , whoa . business .

no shooting .

only thing you 'll get from that clown is a faster way to die . lao to the contrary ...

i intend no slight to you , but i can not find the english to adequately express just what he is . i suppose western mythology would describe him as a fury .

i had heard something like this . describe it for me . the `` hit '' .

bad news . alot of action on the streets tonight , and nobody bothered to clear it with me . tin- tin got himself whacked .

actually , i was planning on running down to kinkos . do you think you could give me ride ?

sebastian was a pathological liar . i would n't believe a word he -

kathryn , i know all about you and sebastian .

who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me . my brother is dead , have some respect .

look , i know this sounds corny , but whenever i feel like i ca n't go on i ... turn to jesus and he helps me through the problem . call me an anachronism , but -

thank you .

did you know sebastian well ?

you promise not to say anything ?

i ca n't tell you . i 'm sworn to secrecy .

not a whole lot . we take some classes together . he 's got a bad rep , but it 's mostly bullshit .

nothing .

that 's not his style . one thing i can say about valmont . he always speaks the truth .

really ? i thought he said it all the time .

i know . i wish i felt the same . unfortunately , i feel nothing . i think it was just the conquest . sorry , i 'm completely fucked up .

what are you saying ?

i 'm fine . i have to get going to my friends ' house . was it --

hi .

well , i 'm afraid you do n't have a choice in the matter . you make me sick . you 're a hypocrite and i do n't associate with hypocrites .

good for you .

back to the city . i may take off to europe for the rest of the summer . i just ca n't handle it around here .

i just came to say goodbye .

then what 's wrong ? i love you annette . it 's not like you have a husband , unless your married to jesus .

oh dear , are you actually laughing ?

fine .

you must take me for a real idiot .

i 'm doing some volunteer work .

alone again . what are you up to today ?

reading .

well , i was just calling to tell you i was thinking about you and i miss you . i 'll let you go .

it was n't a date . he 's just a friend .

it 's not about being happy . you and i ca n't -

alright . i want you to leave and go back to new york .

you truly want to do something to make me happy ?

that 's also none of your business .

that 's none of your business .

well try this one on for size . i think i 'm falling in love with you .

it 's my house .

you do n't find me cute ? come on , look at these muscles .

i was n't kidding . i 'd like to take you out .

about what you said today in the stable . i 'm not a happy person .

is that the last thing you need ? my your clever .

give me the fucking letter .

you know you could at least have the decency of telling me who 's badmouthing me so i might have the opportunity to confront them face to face . how do you know it 's not some girl who 's pissed off at me for breaking up with her ?

this is my favorite part . even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating . he has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention . every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it .

you know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible .

give me a minute . i 'll be right down .

great book .

you talking to me ?

alright , i said i was sorry . can we start over again ? i think we 've gotten off on the wrong foot .

fine , forget it . it 's obvious that we 're not going to be friends .

who the hell is taking the time to write letters , spreading this shit about me ?

a friend wrote me .

i was n't knocking anything . it 's just my belief that people should n't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions .

no .

i do n't know . relationships seem too distracting . i 'd rather concentrate on my studies .

my mother and i used to ride a lot , before she got sick .

hmmm . i do believe bravo is showing spartacus on television tonight .

are you shitting me ?

any ideas who it could be ?

- none taken -

doctor king is my favorite .

do n't you raise your voice at me . go to your room , now .

those are my letters !

margarita found them while cleaning your room .

cecile , is that the best you can do ? you must forgive her , kathryn . she 's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before .

i do n't love him . i love ronald .

i 'm so proud of you . you 're becoming a woman .

cecile , you had an orgasm .

cecile , i think you 're going to have a hard time crying rape if that 's all he did .

why did n't you do something ?

cecile , you have to tell me .

did you hide the letters ?

that 's so romantic . have you responded ?

oh come on cecile . he 's crazy about you .

that was cool .

okay .

let 's try it again , only this time i 'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth . when i do that i want you to massage my tongue with yours . that 's what first base is .

ah duh . boys . i 've never even gone to first base with a guy . what do i do ?

he 's alright . he kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over fourth of july .

you promised to let me kiss you .

please please please . i 'll do anything . just do n't call my mom .

i want to go home .

i want to go home .

well , you do n't have to get nasty about it .

you do ?

it works a little .

i think that 's all the time we have for today .

do n't you want to change that ?

but you said you have the worst reputation .

i know .

jesus . we 've been at this for six months .

alright honey , just calm down , take a deep breath , and step out of the circle .

you do n't know him . i 'm so stupid .

who told you ?

grand central . you better not be fucking with me cause it 's your ass on the line .

one .

mcconnell , i 'm gon na out your ass in two seconds if you do n't tell me where she is .

yes !

-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah .

do n't worry about it . i 'll stay .

i think he 's high on drugs . he hit me , then took off . i 'm afraid to be alone . please come over .

what do you mean ?

hello .

war it is .

did n't you hear what i said ?

come again ?

silly rabbit . my triumph is n't over her . it 's over you .

i 'd love to , but unfortunately i 'm expecting some company .

annette ?

a little melodramatic , do n't you think .

then do me a favor and get rid of her . if not for me , then do it for you . look at yourself . you 're a joke . she 's turned you into jelly . what do you want to be , one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling . people used to respect you . they feared you and now you 're going to throw that all away .

is that what you think ?

oh come on , kathryn , it was just a contest .

some other time .

it was ... fantastic .

if you 're heading towards her room , you wo n't find her .

a momentary lapse of judgment , soon to be rectified .

well i know how it went with cecile . she wo n't shut up about it . how 'd it go with mrs. jesus ?

and that 's why you 're losing your bet ?

she 's really getting to you , is n't she ?

what 's your problem ?

jesus , she reeks of laura ashley . oh , she 's crying . wittle baby 's upset by the big bad book .

yeah .

take a look for yourself .

moving along quite well .

thank you . mmmm , that feels good .

but who will they turn to for help ?

no .

i 'm working on it .

it would feel so yummy .

in english . i 'll fuck your brains out .

i 'm not interested in the latest dating tips from jonathan taylor thomas .

why not ?

i see your point ... though why should i care ?

in any event , my feelings were hurt when i learned that he had fallen for someone else . someone chaste ... pure ... innocent .

lovely . how is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying bali ? zipping through my inheritance per usual ?

i 'm just taking the poor girl under my wing .

i ca n't thank you enough .

ronald ? that 's crazy .

it 's worse . i think there 's something going on between cecile and her music teacher .

i got your message and came as quick as i could .

that 's beautiful .

got me off the streets ? i live on 59th and park .

it 's really important .

well please leave a message that i called .

hi . is annette at home ?

uh huh . you beat me three times .

i did ?

yes , you already did .

do n't worry about it .

do you mind if i check upstairs ?

did she show up ?

what time is it ?

you bastard !

where the hell do you come off hitting women ?

you 're a lucky guy .

it 's one of the clearest memories i have . twelfth night ... burning pine ... and mummers ' plays .

i know how it is . my dad collects miniature canon .

all right , amy . go tell edward to take you .

but it wo n't be christmas tomorrow .

would n't it be just the same , darling , if daddy dropped the present at mrs. farren 's on his way to town tomorrow morning ?

what 's her name ?

it was right there on top . is n't she pretty ?

where 'd you get this , darling ?

but where did you get it , amy ?

where did you get this ring ?

i made a wish today , and it came true just like edward said it would .

did your wishes ever come true ?

what song , dear ?

but edward , in this kind of a wish that does n't matter .

you get your wish !

that darn kid . i never in my life expected her to get an a in arithmetic . math 's is a practical science -- - if she understands figures , she 's well out of her own world of make-believe .

i 'm sorry . i was somewhere else . he returns to the card game .

i 'm never unfair .

that 's right .

oilie , that 's for the children to play with .

yes , darling ,

i know , dear . i understand . but try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking . and especially today let 's forget about it . we want a really bang-up birthday party , do n't we ?

that 's why i can tell you , straight out , you think too much about irena -- blame yourself for her death . and its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about amy .

all i have to do is look at amy 's eyes , blue and deep like yours .

she 's not irena 's child -- there 's nothing of irena in her . she 's my child .

i wonder if you do n't resent that in her ?

no , she went runnin ' off to some old house she was talkin ' about yesterday .

i thought you were with amy .

i got lots of presents .

no , darling , i had n't intended to .

hello , amy .

mommy 's having a party for me . i asked robert , and donald , and lois --

your birthday , amy -- as she goes ) -- and i have something for you in my locker . a present .

daddy ?

i have eyes too , and i tell you no one 's there . if you deny that , if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden , then i 'm afraid i shall have to punish you . do you understand ?

but ...

daddy !

this one has n't got a name on it . who 's this one for , amy ?

just you wait !

no , i did n't .

now look , this is the last time you come to me with any such stories i 'm sick of this sort of thing .

it was just a voice .

and who did the voice belong to ?

but you told me in the garden -- that the wish about the tree could n't come true .

but , amy , that was just a story ; it was n't real . that tree 's no mailbox .

but i told you about that so long ago ; you could n't have been more than three when i told you that tree was a magic mailbox .

yes , i did .

well , i guess we 're not a very proper family .

we open ours on christmas eve . that 's considered proper .

my goodness , do n't you open your presents until christmas morning ?

i do n't know yet .

oh , it is , it is ! death 's terrible .

but she 's dead !

do n't cry , amy .

i want to touch it .

because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind .

oh , how beautiful !

light shining ) in her eyes ) throw sea weeds into the flames , and the fire turns blue !

this is more fun than just pretend .

i shall want you for always .

but where is that ?

i 've wanted a friend too . i 've been lonely .

who are you ?

but what happened to the little deer ?

but i saw what it was . it 's the little deer .

must n't look , little miss . must n't look .

but i do n't want you coming here alone . you get me to go with you when you want to come here . you promise ?

you just wait until i finish here . i 've got to dust these ships for your dad .

i was n't singing to myself .

i 'm trying to .

the ring up to him ) what 's a mourning ring ?

maybe , if it 's a real mourning ring like we have in jamaica . all you got to do is turn it on your finger , close your eyes , and make a wish .

that 's a fine-looking ring .

my little girl said she 'd kill you if you came to see me . i ca n't let you die . we 'll have to hide you .

hide me ? why ?

what ?

a christmas present . it 's been so long since i 've had a christmas present .

it was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here ; with the british on one side and the americans on the other .

the headless horseman --

the ring ? we 'll have no more nonsense about the ring .

but i only came to give back the ring .

good night ... barbara ...

i-sha n't see her . no , barbara , no .

yes . yes , barbara , i sha n't forget .

mother ! you called me by name !

it was pale ... a shadowed gold .

my daughter died long ago .

such a brief visit , but dear child , it has made my christmas very merry .

wait a minute . listen .

good heavens ! what could you be giving me . little miss ?

`` to daddy from amy . '' here 's one for miss callahan . this one says , `` to edward from amy . `` .

that 's because she made a promise , and she ' a keeping it , are n't you , darling . you saw the way she played this afternoon , edward .

she pleaded so to do it

got more leaf mold now than we 'll ever need , mr. reed . i thought i 'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean .

i thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin .

yes , everything 's all right , edward .

i know it may seem stupid of me -- but it is n't the slap i 'm worried about -- it 's the reason .

i do n't believe in pms . women made it up just so they can be bitchy .

sorry about frida . she 's been friends with jen forever .

it all starts with them going to the bathroom together .

i mean body temperature . do you have a fever ?

yeah but they looked cool ...

yeah yeah i know . smoking kills . i 'll quit someday . does n't it seem like all the cool people smoke ?

you should n't smoke . it 'll kill you .

maybe that bartender made it up . i mean i think coyotes are rather beautiful . maybe `` coyote ugly '' is really a compliment . like someone who 's conventionally `` ugly '' but is really beautiful .

do n't apologize . it 's great to see a woman really enjoying her food . i hate it when i buy a woman dinner and she wo n't even touch it .

sorry , do n't mean to be wolfing down . i 'm just starving .

guess you like those coyote ugly steaks now , huh ?

now it 's menopause . she 's always hot . i got ta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold . it 's always something .

diet and exercise , that 's all there is . i 'm not a big proponent of the pms craze , but there 's a book my wife mentioned called `` the pms diet , '' which may be helpful .

and keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it 's related to your period and not just in your head .

a dog at victoria 's secret ?

there was a sale .

a bite ... where 'd you get bitten ?

no , i 'm not a lesbian . geez mom .

what does that have to do with me ?

frida ? you okay ?

did i kill a guy named benito ?

about mark ? carlton ?

the werewolf always dies at the end . did n't you see `` american werewolf in london ? ''

no . i ca n't take that chance . i 'd rather kill myself .

i 'm cleaning my stove .

i think i already have .

who is this madame sconce ? let 's find her and talk to her .

check out what i found .

you 're such a good friend .

well if he does , he did n't give you away . he must really like you .

you expecting someone ?

there 's kind of this guy i 'm seeing .

frida , carlton 's dead .

shit , i guess i missed work .

no , last night i think i chased carlton around as a wolf and killed him . i woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed . and my throat hurts .

because of pms , i get hairy , my nails turn into claws , i eat raw meat , i roam the city hunting for flesh . i 've become a werewolf !

please come over . i 'm begging you . what should i do with the arm ? should i call the cops or ... peter ?

you fucked carlton ? see i told you he liked you .

yes they are ! look how much more hair i have than you !

oh my god , look . my arms are so hairy !

no you do n't , believe me .

oh my god . i 've never had that before . i 've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one 's ever said `` hey there beautiful . ''

you 're just saying that .

how 'd it go with the cop ?

i looked like an italian man !

frida , i 'm your friend . i 'm not judging you ... you did n't sleep with the creep did you ?

at least your pms is over .

i could n't stop eating steak . i felt out of control -- like i was making up for all those years being a vegetarian . i could n't get enough . and then gregory walked me home ... and he peed in front of me .

i do n't remember . we kissed at my door and next thing i knew i woke up with my period . alone .

did i kill him ? of course not !

there you go , blaming yourself for everything again .

you are not frida , we all have a little hair there . i did n't even notice till you showed me . we can bleach that , it 's no big deal .

i do n't see anything . maybe just a little .

i never thought of it like that . i never know what to do on dates . do guys still pay ?

maybe they have to pee .

you 're so lucky you have george and do n't need to go on dates anymore .

and she got the medium .

where are all the mediums ?

i do n't know .

or if there 's a full moon .

only to see .

i 'd kill for just a little bloated .

i guess i have a weakness for him . it 's those big brown bambi eyes .

anything 's better than mark .

yeah even then look what happened : michael mortenson kissed you and billy sullivan threw a worm at me .

i did n't have to pee then .

well i have it worse than cramps . goodnight gregory .

come on , did n't all that steak make you thirsty ?

you said you 're starving . come on , i ca n't stand a woman who wo n't eat .

no , i 'm serious . how about we have dinner and i tell you about it ?

so you 're grant 's secretary ?

i know .

my bra is my biggest supporter .

i did something stupid . i had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport . it turned out to be money -- so i kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me .

come on frida , i 'm not kidding . i 'm totally fucked . let me in .

i 'm kinda borrowing it . who 's this , mr. date-guy ?

hey wait , i paid three bucks for that burger . you owe me ...

you look different . i mean you look good .

since when do you care ?

a little .

i know . the important thing is that it stop .

no way can anything be proved . all they have are some wolf hairs . no one believes in werewolves .

we can work this out . other couples have worse problems .

i knew you would n't kill me .

i have the silver bullets in case i need to protect myself . does that make you feel better ?

go away . i might hurt you .

yes , your pms . frida i can deal with that .

frida ? you okay ? look , i think i know what happened to mark . i want to help . i 'm coming over .

hello ?

i love you too .

that 's it ? hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it . she made us call her a different name . she 'd say , `` you 're talking to betty now '' and we 'd leave the house for a few days .

no , but thanks for the warning .

what 's that supposed to mean ?

yeah , every guy you date winds up dead .

no , i got it . it 's okay .

yeah sort of . where 's lloyd ?

frida . i was looking for you . you changing jobs ?

he was ripped to shreds also . in his apartment .

it was n't a date . jennifer invited me along to dinner with them .

you sure ? it 's my favorite shirt , mind if i check ?

no . nope , nothing in it .

oh , nothing 's wrong . just ... well do n't you have your period ?

goodnight .

i really got ta get going .

he 's bad news . he cheated on me , he insults me . now suddenly he gets jealous if i have a date .

how about you ? briefs or boxers ?

you know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you 're in an accident ? well this guy was n't wearing any underwear .

my mom used to get pms too .

no . really . i do n't drink coffee anymore . i used to love it but my tastes have changed recently .

there 's a lot of that going around .

i got ta get going . peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag .

okay , if you think of anything else , please give us a call .

i wish i could help but last i saw gregory was outside my front door .

you use the word `` fucking . '' you 're sexualizing things . stop berating yourself . it 's okay to have sex .

and how did you feel when you ate this guy ?

oh , i see ... interesting theory .

that i 'm a doormat of course . the shrink makes more notes .

yes , jennifer told me . what does that have to do with me ?

no , i said it was our first date .

take some allergy medicine .

carlton insisted on leaving with her . maybe he got lucky .

two bags for them , and one bag for your head in case her two fall off .

why would you want to be a cop ?

she says she 's on the rag every time i get called in to investigate a murder .

i know . i followed you . to the zoo , to her house , to your house ...

it has to be frida . this makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass .

it 's a bit farfetched that mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy . this makes no sense .

she was n't the last one to see them alive . whoever killed them was .

deal . and if some mutherfucker 's about to blow me away , shoot him .

poseur was missing a chunk of his neck . and his eyes were open . that always bugs me out . do me a favor , if some mutherfucker 's about to blow me away , remind me to close my fuckin ' eyes .

i checked all the zoos . no missing animals . you think a pitbull ?

she was never a suspect lloyd . some animal must have done this .

frida 's sheets checked out fine . it was just her own blood . from her ... you know .

torn apart . limb from limb . a bloody gruesome mess .

nah , i do n't wan na break up with wanda , i just wan na see carmen too .

not really ...

what of ?

i < u > know < /u > it 's his doctor ... i need the file on.. daniel paul schreber m.d .

what 's he doing here ?

how long have you been here ?

i 'm afraid so .

i met a friend of yours the other night , doctor . tall fellow . no hair . rather pale skin ...

you seem a little edgy . everything okay ?

yes , sir .

bumstead , you 're starting to annoy me . this case is very important to me . just a little warning : i 've got my eye on you inspector , remember that .

what makes you think that ! if you would learn to concentrate on facts , not get so side-tracked - you might get things done faster , bumstead ...

ill be the judge of that . anything else ?

yes . this way .

wo n't say . says he must talk to you .

do you wash your hands before you type things ?

yes , sir . anything wrong ?

you typed this report ?

why , that 's ridiculous . you just ...

no ... no doctor ...

look ! this is a good one !

a fanciful idea , mister white .

i 'm ... being ... punished .

what are you hiding ?

everyone get 's one - very much like this ... but this one 's special . it will help you understand , everything ...

if you would only take this , inject it in your brain , everything would be much clearer .

you ca n't go yet . we 've got so much to talk about ...

i 'm sorry . about before .

horrible ...

i told you , i ca n't remember a thing !

you 're supposed to be my doctor , right ?

bad dreams ?

what does she say ? the woman .

that 's easy . you ...

i ca n't do that . it 's dangerous . what about my parents ? do you know where i can find them ?

how do you know i 'm innocent ?

i thought it would make more sense . i 'm getting the pieces , but when i put it together it feels like ... like you 're telling me about somebody else 's life ...

fine .

you 're fired .

what do you think you 're doing ? !

choices ? ? ?

great .

well it 's a last minute change .

uh , mr. president ... i do n't believe that 's on your agenda today .

) listen , you little ...

lots of shelters were in this bill .

mr. president ...

... alright .

right and do n't embellish .

you 're kidding ?

uh -- i do n't know . sometimes it 's just like a barter thing ... is this legal ?

what ?

uh -- mr. alexander ?

are you threatening me ?

bob ...

he 's only doing what you told him to .

dave , these things get awfully complicated sometimes ...

i 'm telling you , bob , it 's a gift . when you got a ferrari you do n't leave it in the garage .

three years .

alan , we still have to control this guy ...

i do n't want him caring about his wife ! what about the vice president !

are you out of your mind ?

clean .

no one gets to be vice president by being that clean .

i just hope this yutz can pull it off .

what about containment , alan ?

it 's simple , alan . we send the vice- president to africa or something , dig up some dirt on him , force him to resign and get our ` president ' to nominate a new one . the whole thing takes a few weeks tops .

yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon .

just do n't call him , alan !

she 's a little hysterical right now . we 've got her upstairs in a laundry room .

where 's the girl ?

well -- take care .

that 'd be great .

well , there 's lots of places where i think you can save , but i 'm not the one who 's ... ... . i mean , i 'm not the one who 's not the pres ...

you know -- priorities . remember when you could n't get your car fixed ` cause you wanted to get that piano ?

i 'm not surprised . can we save anywhere ?

i 'm not sure .

i am the government .

it 's fine .

i 'm serious , dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this .

i was gon na do something with joan .

now he 's making stuff up about me .

let 's call it a night . i ca n't take any more .

fine .

dave ...

what ?

i do n't think so .

now some of this may feel a bit strange at first . you got ta remember that even a professional politician has some trouble getting used to ...

will he be alright ?

it 's actually kind of serious , dave . i 'm afraid the president 's not in very good shape .

well , it 's ... it 's sort of an ... an ` incident ' really ...

now , dave , something has come up and i think we need to talk about it ...

perceptual ?

how 'd you get started ?

really ?

one day my wife says to me 'why do n't you try running for office . you talk about it all the time , why do n't you just do it ? ' so i tell my boss i have a dentist appointment and i go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break . next thing i know , i 'm a councilman .

oh ... hi .

i just fired bob alexander .

something like what ...

thanks , duane .

i would have taken a bullet for i you , dave .

well ...

oh ... right ... you know , ever since the stroke ...

yeah , but bob found me when i was stuck in firearms and tobacco ...

` bleed for your king . '

you mean with you and everything ?

i had a feeling .

you got a gun ?

i ca n't say .

on occasion for security purposes , to double for the president at the secret service hires someone public functions and exposed situations .

... not exactly the oval office .

i missed ...

yeah , well ... it 's finally over .

it 's nice .

i sure fall for some weird guys .

you really believe that ?

i mean , i want to ... i just , i feel strange ...

i know . i 'm sorry ...

i ca n't .

what ?

yeah ... bedtime .

but you could go to jail for it .

i know .

you know , dave -- it is dave , is n't it ? i ca n't keep all of this a secret .

yeah . is that funny ?

yes .

i guess .

what ?

he was n't always like that , anyway .

you do n't have to keep walking with me . i 'm okay from here .

you sure this goes somewhere ?

how were you gon na get home ?

just souvenirs . towels and stuff .

home .

where are you going ?

i 'm not the first lady , anymore . i should n't be here .

i 'm sure they did . 'state of emergency . ' 'national security . ' you ever hear of the constitution ?

they asked me to help .

when were you all planning to tell me ? a year from now ? after the election ... what 's going on here ? dave hesitates .

i do n't know .

anybody would have done it .

no .

mind if i sit down ?

i saw the light . i thought maybe you were up .

... . ellen .

since when do you care about the homeless ?

thanks for doing this , ellen .

uh ...

what are you staring at ?

fabulous .

oh yeah . did you take care of later on ?

father mclntire . he blessed you at the inauguration .

who 's this priest i 'm thanking ?

we 're all set , sir .

try to find someone who looks like me this time . that last guy was a joke .

nooooo . believe me . there are no others ... no rebels ... nobody ... it 's over ... it 's ooooo ... .

where are your headquarters , rebel ? tell me or i 'll let you hang there forever ... forever !

please ... .shoot me .

it ca n't be . are we truly in hell ?

it 's some kind of ... .elevator . there must be something under the ground here ... .maybe ... .military .

oh , yes . quiet . yes . we must be quiet .

i have looked bad for four years . everyone in the world has looked bad for four years . thank god looks do n't matter as much as they once did .

what is it ?

you 'll find the ways , miss mary . and when ya do ... we 'll sail on over to the mainland ... or any other damn mainland fer that matter ... and start us a recruitin ' program . there 's millions o ' bees out there jus ' waitin ' fer ' a general ta lead 'em on ta vict'ry !

it 's not a very big army . and small as it is you wo n't be able to continue feeding it for very long . we 've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on ...

tonight ?

... captain rhodes is trying to ...

well , you managed ta make it here jus ' in time fer this case , did n't ya ?

looks like just two . we can take 'em when the time comes .

datura metel . the devil 's trumpet . do n't worry . i ai n't goin ' religioso again . it 's a flower that grows on these islands . where i come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a mickey finn . it 's toxic . ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it ... or ... in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system .

curse ?

the man i was with ... until today ... believed that praying was for blind men who could n't see the truth .

what you wan na do ?

if you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system . then , if you move fast enough , stay ahead of 'em ... without bein ' able to signal each other , they might have a hard time catchin ' you .

this stuff really works ? no shit ?

we know what 's down there . we did the loading ' and unloadin ' when the stuff came ashore in the early days . a direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o ' damage .

what ?

i got some fuel comin ' out and , i hope , some automatic rifles .

we got a boat .

there ya go . complete with air canisters ... little motors .

what'dya tell that soldier , soldier ? you tell him we was rebels ?

maybe .

the hospital ?

ai n't no place safe .

the purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much ... food ... as possible . the purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side . the fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit , not the primary goal . the primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper . keep them fed and they behave . keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been . you saw them in there .

any dead whose brains are intact will revive .

you can believe this , miguel . i 'll kill you if you shoot . we must wait . i 'll ... .i 'll do it ... .i 'll do it myself ... .when it needs to be done .

we must wait . one day the curse will pass . one day a dead man will ... will ...

you are dying , too .

he is dying . he knows it .

sir , tyler is innocent of any crime against the state . captain rhodes is ...

rhodes , you and i had a roll in the hay together when i first got here . it was a wholly unsatisfying experience which i do not want to , and which i never will repeat ! so give up , mister ! i 'm going home ... to that roommate you mentioned .

if you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight i 'll go to dickerson .

mary .

need what ? civilised order like we have down here ? christ !

i am not ... a guerilla fighter , toby . i 'm not a pioneer . i 'm not ... i 'm not strong that way . i need ...

we 're both gon na leave . leave the island . i 've been talkin ' to tricks . we think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts . they 're crated up real small . they 've got air canisters . there 's food inside . even a little motor .

it 's because of me .

that bastard . i did n't think he 'd make his move so fast .

some of rhodes ' men . at the door .

toby ... thank god ... wait here . i got ta find out what 's goin ' on .

no , sir .

my ... '' detail '' , sir . we 're going to bury the heads .

tricks ... jesus ...

what'dya get ?

hey , tricks . some detail they got you on .

to fucking mutt .

i do n't think they 're in school .

sounds boring to me .

it will ? how do you figure ?

terrible . awful ! i met the most beautiful girl i 've ever seen in my life !

how was dinner ?

knox overstreet .

this is it .

why ? nobody knows who we are .

oh god , it 's over now !

anything else you 'd care to rifle through , mr. dalton ?

so keep your head about you -- the lot of you -- understood ?

mr. keating !

i 'm not ?

what is this `` dead potts society '' ? i want names .

no one , sir . it was just me . i did the proofing so i inserted my article in place of rob crane 's .

are you kidding ? do n't be ridiculous .

maybe he 'll have some advice . maybe he 'll even talk to your father .

why do n't you talk to mr. keating about it ?

what are you going to do ? - charlie ?

no .

where 'd you find them ?

my parents made me take clarinet but i hated it . the sax is more sonorous .

charlie , that was great ! where did you learn to play like that ?

all right . i 'll second that .

you 're welcome to join us , todd .

i do n't know about anyone else , but i could use a refresher in latin . eight o'clock in my room ?

then do n't tell me how to talk to my father when you 're the same way . all right ? !

okay , so i do n't like it any more than you do . i 'm just saying

todd 's brother is jeffrey anderson .

that 's not my fault .

sure , but cameron asked me too . anybody mind including him ?

well , meeks aced latin and i did n't quite flunk english so if you want , we 've got our study group .

knox ? !

what are you doing ? !

chris . we got it . let 's go .

it 's just for a little while . you promised .

my word

knox , if you promise that this will be the end of it-

are you going with chet ?

then you would n't be here warning me about chet .

of course just like that . that 's how you always know when it 's right .

i did n't mean to make a fool of you .

if they catch you here , we 'll both be in big trouble .

knox ! what are you doing here ?

i 'll be there . the danburrys . friday night . thank you , chris .

knox . oh yes , knox . i 'm glad you called .

hello ?

the pleasure is mine .

pleased to meet you .

that goes for all of you . now eat with your correct hands .

what is wrong with old habits , mr. overstreet ?

`` we went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life . '' anybody want to read ?

rahesh non never existed , mr. meeks . you make him or someone like him up . no self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one i received :

and do n't limit poetry to the word . poetry can be found in a work of art , music , a photograph , in the way a meal is prepared -- anything with the stuff of revelation in it . it can exist in the most everyday things but it must never , never be ordinary by all means , write about the sky or a girl 's smile but when you do , let your poetry conjure up salvation day , doomsday , any day , i do n't care , as long as it enlightens us , thrills us and -- if it 's inspired -- makes us feel a bit immortal .

precisely , meeks . greek for the herd . however , be warned that , when you say `` the hoi polloi '' you are actually saying the the herd . indicating that you too are `` hoi polloi . ''

the hoi polloi . does n't it mean the herd ?

carpe diem ... seize the day .

boys marching . clapping in unison .

stretch it , pull it , it will never cover any of us . kick at it , beat at it , it will never be enough-

a sweaty-toothed madman

i ... i close my eyes . his image floats beside me .

now there 's the poet speaking ! close your eyes and think of the picture . describe what you see . now !

use your imagination ! first thing that pops to your mind , even if it 's gibberish !

a crazy madman .

yawp !

again ! louder !

yawp !

a yawp ?

yeah .

not if you 're going to stay true to yourself .

give your father the benefit of the doubt . talk to him . let him see who you are .

why do you do it ? i mean , with all this seize-the-day business , i 'd have thought you 'd be out seeing the world or something ?

actually , i 'd like to talk to you alone .

oh captain , my captain , we came here so i could talk to you about something .

i was just looking in an old annual and ...

i do n't know .

you have another choice .

i 'm calling her !

listen , anything 's , better than mystery meat .

yeah , you just do everything they say ! you 'll be in daddy 's law firm as sure as i 'm standing here . and you 'll be approving loans till you croak .

i got ta get to the tryouts . wish me luck .

i certainly would n't lose any sleep over it . it 's just a bunch of people trying to impress nolan .

yes sir .

father , i have the main part . the performance is tomorrow night . father , please .

did you really think i would n't find out ? ! `` my niece is in a play with your son , '' mrs. marks says . `` you must be mistaken , '' i say . `` my son is n't in a play . '' you made a liar out of me , neil ! now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting .

neil , you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately .

you know me , always taking on too much .

you know what this means to your mother , do n't you ?

when you 've finished medical school and you 're on your own , you can do as you please . until then , you will listen to me .

i 'm sorry , neil .

but father , i 'm assistant editor .

put more into it !

chicken shit . where were we ?

lots of girls . the girl who plays hermia is incredible .

this play ?

oh .

this is your desk set . i do n't get it .

from my father and nolan .

no ! i do n't know , i 'll probably never know . the point is , there 's nothing you can do about it so butt out , all right ? i can take care of myself just fine . all right ?

so ?

i know that . what 's it got to do with you ?

a play , dummy .

put what ? goddamn it , tell me .

want to come to the study group ?

i do n't .

why 'd you leave balincrest ?

todd anderson .

what the hell are you talking about ?

i once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle , then he corked it , sealing it tight , and threw it to a baby octopus . the little sucker felt its way around that bottle , and in less than two minutes , got that cork off , slid inside , and ate that fish .

someone ... maybe they sent an sos !

just trying to get to my boat ...

you trying to take over my show finnegan , that what you trying to do ?

did you clear this ?

i told you ...

shut up !

hanover , listen ...

speedboat in the middle of the ocean ...

i know it ... but you want to get where you want to get , and back ? i need a chief engineer , and unless you got a replacement , i 'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion .

take note mr. mason ... this is why you hire a professional ... no whining . no excuses .

you know what they say ... the classics are eternal .

where 's you friend ?

three minutes ... i 'm not back ... no matter what ... you go ...

right ...

... the minute you start your engines ... it 's goint to kill us , is n't it ?

not like him .

you know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship ? a million little things like this ...

i was so goddamn close , finnegan ! so goddamn close to my island ... i could almost taste the sand ...

you quit high school , lie about your age , join the navy , and next thing you know , four years are up and you need a way to make a living ...

a meat locker .

like cattle ...

how do you know that ?

yeah you did ...

i do n't know where it is !

since i 'm a kid , i had this dream ... i want to own my own tropical island ... beaches , warm ocean , lots of food , little clothes ... population of one ...

that 's what i do .

i 'm not rich people .

look lady , i know you people are used to getting your way ...

what are those things ?

i 'm their ride .

who asked you to !

now look what you did !

i 'm not staying here !

forget them ...

hanover ! ! hanover ! !

so ?

the hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable ...

or i could go for a swim ... although , i got ta tell you ... if i never get in the water again ...

because it 's cool , you know , i can always take a walk or something down the beach ...

and what have you come up with ?

i 'm telling you , man , we got to give the future some serious thought .

not even a joey , i 'm glad to see you ? joey , what happened to your leg ?

joey ... which way 's aft ?

joey ... it 's okay ...

where is everybody ?

i 'm not screwing around with you man ... i hate the cold water .

hey ! you hear me ? come out !

i saw him last night . i thought i was dreaming . i thought i was out of my mind .

it 's not socks , sal .

you did n't get a deer ?

i know . it 's like coming from the moon . or mars .

nick . i 'm so scared . i 'm so fuckin ' scared to go home .

wait a minute . sal . hold it . john wayne 's making so much noise i can hardly --

sal ? sal , it 's me , nick .

right .

you guys are crazy . you know that ? i mean you guys are really nuts .

as soon as you 're hitched , sal . first we get you hitched .

not tonight ? ... you 're not driving up tonight ?

where 's vince ?

i just ... would like to say a few words ... about merle . i guess merle always wanted something ... i do n't know ... better . that fucking guy , he saved my life . he saved sal 's ... what merle liked , he liked things right ... but then there was n't any place for that ... that he could find .

you loaded it , vince ! i saw you !

what the hell 's that for ?

cynthia ! sure .

up a little there ... what would you say ?

that 's him . simon doucet .

what did you say ?

i worked for him ... still do . said he 'd make sure i was left alone if i helped put wade away . he kept his promise for twenty years .

i want to ask you a few questions .

my man dubbs .

you ca n't win like this . you 'll only get older . this is what you wanted !

where ?

just got the call . took him from school . bastard nailed the vice- principal and a teacher .

you ca n't kill me . i 'm going to be mayor tomorrow .

you son-of-a-bitch . how do you stop it ?

what 's this ?

later . i want doucet first .

i want to see my wife and kid .

i was set up and you know it ... but you swore under oath i was dirty . you helped bury me .

twenty years have passed , wade . lay it to rest .

maybe re-animating you was n't such a bright idea . you look like shit .

but sir , sergeant wade saved the hostages .

forget it . stick to the program .

kill him ... kill him .

that 's not your zone . stick to data entry .

it 's a real mess down here . some- thing must a'gone wrong . no man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years .

what do you mean he 's escaped ? ! they 're not supposed to escape !

kill me if you want . hard line me with that ' i ai n't got nothing to lose ' bullshit . but you 've got plenty to lose 'partner ' . you 've got a family . i 'm giving you a chance to see them . i kept in touch . she never married . all these years . maybe she loves you . i would n't know why .

i 've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty . they 'll need your signature .

nobody 's looking .

need help ?

you should be in hospital .

no you do n't .

i 'm signing off .

you okay ?

not yet .

... have you been drinking ?

your girl . being a cop will be rough on her .

simulated one .

wallet , cash , i.d ...

great . my partner 's marcus welby .

that cost me two weeks ' pay .

then find me some cigarettes .

hey , i 'm eating .

good night , wade .

you need anything else ?

thanks .

why ?

drop it .

i also pvc 'd you . youngest officer promoted to sergeant . two cms . four honor medals ...

sir , i took the liberty of running a gci scenario on a tm-1 earlier today ...

how then ?

you ca n't catch this man with a computer .

hey , buddy ...

trust me . you do n't want to know .

then what goes on in there ? what i mean is , what are you thinking about ?

pass .

wan na come ?

some things never change .

how do you know ?

see those guys ?

whoa . do n't touch that . < u > pursuit < /u > < u > mode < /u > . auto pilot . computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits . installed fall 2006. underground rumor has it they modeled it after you , sir .

i 'm ready .

well , that 's good enough for me .

he had a partner . our own ray gallagher . he tagged wade dangerously defiant . psychotic . reckless . seems our commissioner did n't like him much . busted his buns on a narcotic 's violation . wade was sentenced to twenty-five years .

you never want to find out .

this is the guy that killed my partner .

my mom says i 'm gon na grow .

it 's stuck , but thanks for the offer .

have n't seen you around . where have you been all my life , handsome ?

hey , you ! watch out there -- you 're scuffing my brussels carpet -- consarn them .

the -- folks or people , what 's the difference among friends ?

we will --

from over the mountain --

you know that you 're in my house .

you 're lying .

i see why you 're here -- you knew that nobody was coming .

you 're not resting well , are you ? i know -- it 's that music . you need your sleep . is there anything else you want ?

anybody can see that .

well -- it 's high and it 's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it 's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new states growing in the west .

what 's that , sir ?

maybe you can , sometime , daniel . i 'm a farmer , you know , and like to show my farm -- but the thing i 'd like to show you most , you 'll have to see for yourself .

gee -- that fair --

hello , colonel ! want a lift ?

i do n't want to be up there all alone , mama ... . i want to be with you .

daniel ! ... i 've stood just about as much as i can bear !

it 's mine , ma ! pa made it for me -- and i 'm not going to give it to anyone !

yes , you did , daniel ! i saw it from the window . and then to lie about it ! give me that beanshooter , daniel !

say ... about the interest ...

howdy , hank .

why , thank you , tom . i was going to ask you if you thought i could .

i am just thinkin ' -- now they might n't like the idea down in washington .

yes , it 's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer !

sure am .

are you one of old stevens ' customers too ?

belle --

huh ? -- what 's that ? well -- what about it ? who cares , anyhow ?

well -- it seems to me -- i remember when you paid me --

what a fine boy you have , jabez . how old is he now ?

real ! sheriff , you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily , and while it does not satisfy the mortgage , it has become my property .

-- in gold .

well , stone -- have you got the money ?

about what ?

come , come , mr. stone , you are a little upset . it 's not fair to bargain with you now . -- i 'll give you until midnight , mr. stone , but not one minute more . ah , then you 'll come with me indeed .

oh no , you violated clause five of our contract and i could collect right now , if i chose .

my time is n't up yet .

he was --

he ai n't dead -- he 's dancing in there .

i do n't care .

oh come , neighbor stone . i would n't cut that tree if i were you . it means a breach of contract .

a pin , neighbor stone ! i 'm afraid , you 'll have to prick your finger -- but what 's a little pain to a lucky man ?

a clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere . money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man . all he needs is a friend to point it out to him . like that !

you 've had a lot of bad luck these days . and yet -- it 's all so unnecessary . when i think of your opportunities --

they make plucky women in new england . h 'm ... how long have we to wait ?

they 'd have a good neighbor , jabez -- and that 's worth much more than anything else -- much , much more !

what -- what 's on your mind ?

well -- i 'll be -- if it is n't little mary sampson from franklin .

seems like it 's my fault , mr. webster .

ten throws it is .

ten throws -- mr. webster ?

5000 -- that 's just what i owe you .

why not -- ?

you want me to go around --

dan ' l webster ?

mr. webster ... wait ! ... mary !

i do n't know , jabez .

oh , for heaven 's sake , leave me alone !

he 's my son and i like him the way he is . why do you always have to pick on him ? if it 's not the boy it 's me . you do n't like the way i live -- you do n't like my friends , or my new house -- or anything .

ruined -- all the fields -- ruined .

that 's one thing i want to talk to you about , mary .

thanks , mary .

yes -- you are right , mary . i can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- all the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --

mary -- you just wait and see -- it 's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything . i 'll be the biggest man in new hampshire and you 'll be the wife of the biggest man .

yes , mary . it 's been a long day .

looks right elegant , mary .

will you come into town with me tomorrow ?

jabez !

jabez -- you ought to talk to tom about joining the grange .

to save us work on the spring plowing ?

if the pig had n't broke his leg , we could have taken him .

it 's all right , jabez . we 'll find something to pay stevens .

mary -- it 's gone .

your butter money ?

we can still use my butter money .

if it would only move old miser stevens -- we 've still got to pay him .

that 's wonderful language . it would move a stone .

`` ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress , can we -- members of the government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience , can we , without self- reproach , supplicate the almighty mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors ?

hold the splint tighter -- it 's almost done . go on reading , ma . this man , job , he had troubles , did n't he ?

that 's what we said .

i remember dad used to say sometimes , when they were handing out hard luck , the farmers got there first .

down , shep ! down !

gone with daniel webster -- to marshfield , son ... . you told mary to go --

i want you to fix these fish !

you go down and see what 's keeping dorothy .

make out ? we 'll do better than that ! i never thought i 'd be glad for bad luck , but i am . i never thought i 'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time , but i am ! oh , bless ye the works of the lord in the hail and the storm and the rain !

what 's that you say , son ?

why , that 's just sense , son . now a man like daniel webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does . but he 's worth it -- and he helps others . makes all the difference .

i feel -- fidgety , ma -- not right at all .

my son ! do you really think , ma ... .

and why should i ? let him howl if it makes him feel good . consarn it . he 's better off than i am ! i wish i could tell him ... ... up there , just what i think .

consarn the consarn --

it seems such an obvious candidature to us all .

hello , jabez -- i was just talking to stevens about a little extension on your payment .

hello , sheriff .

so you 've made up your mind to go to the party .

i 'll try hard -- i just ca n't take it all in .

let her be , son . she 'll do all right . you better get yourself straightened out .

i guess we wo n't .

well , martin , i only wear them in washington -- that 's the trouble . but if you ever come down there , i 'll show them to you .

what are you looking for , colonel ? what 's your name ?

why -- yes -- it 's hard to put it into words , mr. webster . there 's this matter of little daniel 's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there 's something else that 's wrong -- it gets worse , year after year -- it 's like a shadow growing -- i ca n't really talk about it , even to ma -- she puts it all on jabez and i wo n't stand for that .

it is .

someone to see you , dan ' l !

i do ! if i ca n't win this case with a jury , you shall have me , too . if two new hampshire men are n't a match for the devil , we 'd better give this country back to the indians .

your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit , mr. webster -- if you have no more arguments to adduce i 'll take him along now .

cup for cup !

oh .. not that you ever get drunk ! no , indeed ! but a kind of overpowering lassitude or , more plainly , a deep and enveloping sleep .

why , certainly -- but be careful , mr. scratch -- medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back , even with old-timers like yourself .

i 'll be there , too !

it 's only a short drive , mr. webster .

no , no ... i want to talk to men ... to people in cross corners ... to my neighbors ...

it 's corny , but i could live with it .

so , you go on upstairs to the party , your lady sees you , you run into each other 's arms . music comes up , you live happily ever after , that it ?

that is christmas music .

like i said , argyle ... you 're fast .

what 's happening ?

i told them we 're old friends and you were my guest at the party .

hey , business is business . you use a gun , i use a fountain pen , what 's the difference ? to put it in my terms , you 're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you did n't expect a poison pill was gon na be running around the building . hans , baby ... i 'm your white knight .

put it down now .

sounds better than nothing .

one weekend i went to a combat ranch ... you know , that game with the , the guns that shoot red paint ? must sound pretty silly to you ...

they invited me to the xmas party . who knew ?

i 'm a cop from new york .

you ... you do n't work for nakatomi ... and if you 're not one of them ...

actually , i was always partial to roy rogers . i really dug those sequined shirts .

mr. mystery guest . are you still there ?

the only thing left for them is the city grid ... ... they may not do it .

three down , four to go --

if out plan works ... the fbi will get rid of it for us .

thirty minutes to break the code ... two hours for the five mechanicals . the seventh lock ... that 's out of my hands .

we have a pregnant woman out there -- -- relax , she 's not due for two weeks , but a marble floor is n't doing her back any good . i 'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there 's a sofa .

john !

sure . it 's unnerving . i remember this one particular married woman , she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash ... i mean , talk about your wind chill factor ...

... i 've missed you . *

ramona ... no , pomona , that 's it .

well , cappy roberts retired out here a couple years ago . he said i could bunk with him .

nice , but one of us is three hours out of sync . i think it 's me . is there a place i can wash up ?

relax , ellis . i 'm off duty .

in my youth , partner . in my youth .

the way you drove that car , i figured you for the streets .

thanks ... partner .

al , what 's wrong ? did something -- -- oh , god . you 're coming in ! that 's it , is n't it ? christ , powell , i told you what you 're dealing with here --

uh , what do i call you ?

i 've seen enough phoney id 's in my time to recognize that the ones they 've got cost a fortune . add all that up and i do n't know what the fuck it means , but these are bad ass preps and they 're here to stay .

give me that . now , listen to me , mister , i do n't know what you think you 're doing , but demolishing a building does n't fall under the definition of 'help ' ! there 's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass --

what 's it look like ? we 're going in .

dwayne robinson . well , what have you learned ? what do they want ?

fuck you , sir - if i 'm right , i do n't need you . what i want is - if i make an honest mistake i want help .

they jet 's comin ' out . but do n't let 'em off the ground .

gene , jesus , what a bull he is !

hey , sonny ! i 'm watchin ' it on tv !

it 's okay ... it 's okay ...

hey , do n't take the car !

sonny , i 'm gettin ' real bad vibes .

i love you .

oh , yeah , i will ...

what guns ?

he says he does n't know . why do n't you cook whatever 's there ?

jenny ?

that 's why i can talk to you , as an equal , sonny . you got to merge your whole soul with god . and then you are him and one with the holy ghost .

no . look , we 're kind of ... .

well , then ...

that 's good then . you 've found something .

look ... do n't throw that on me .

you do n't have a choice ?

oh ... they 're fucken crazy . that 's a snow job . do n't listen to that shit !

what ?

denmark ? sweden ?

you 're really crazy .

i 'm not on the phone to talk to you about that . well , i do n't know what to say , leon . when you gim me that ... when you hit me with that shit . i mean , what am i supposed to say ?

what do you mean ... what am i talking about ? do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life ? i am dying . do you know ... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you ?

so ... that sure is something .

you think it over , leon .

how is he gon na hurt you on the telephone ?

he 's scared . it 's crazy . i never met anyone like him . his wife , he 's a wonderful father to his children . his mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back , he sees them , he pays their rent . unbelievable . i wanted to get married ... he did n't really want it ... he 's married already ! but he did it . i do n't know why . i thought it would help me , but it did n't . i was just as confused and unhappy was before ; i did terrible things .

somebody 's got to stop him , leon .

if he wo n't listen to you , who will he listen to ?

well , you got to get hold of yourself . you got to talk to him , tell him to give himself up .

okay ...

cokes , seven-ups ... also some aspirin ...

what else ?

you know , you 're telling me that a helicopter ca n't land here ...

sonny , your wife 's on the way ... we reached her ... your wife 's on the way ... everything you asked for , you got .

nothin ' doin ' . i give you one hostage when you bring my wife , and one for the helicopter , one for the jet , and the rest can come home on the jet .

the girl hostages .

i want to see my wife . i want you to bring her down here .

when i 'm bein ' fucked , i like to be kissed a lot . who the fuck are you tryin ' to con me into some deal ? you 're a city cop , where 's the fbi ? this is a federal offense , i got kidnapping , armed robbery , they 're gon na bury me ! you know it , you ca n't talk for them , you 're some flunky pig tryin ' to bullshit me . now god damn it , get somebody in charge here to talk to me !

what ?

well , armed , then . nobody 's been hurt . release the hostages , nobody is gon na worry over kidnapping charges , the worst you 're gon na get is five years -- you can be out in a year .

you got these cops outta here . they 're comin ' in too close .

so -- you want me to send one out there ... okay . i 'll see what i can do .

you 're all one way ! i 'm bein ' reasonable with you ; give me somethin ' ... give me one of them , anyway ... just one ...

they 're what 's keeping me alive . you think you 're dealing with an idiot ? talk to me then .

you frisk me .

i frisk you ?

okay , sonny , i want to see if the people in the bank are okay , then what i want to do is work out a way to get them out of there . i want to come over there , without a gun ... and you can frisk me . so you can see you can trust me . so we can talk and find a way outta this mess .

give me a name , any name , just so i got somethin ' to call you .

what do you want to know that for ?

right -- got ya . okay , so there 's you -- what 's your name ?

i got sal .

why did n't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street ?

here comes the fbi . you men lookin ' for protection ? we got all the police right here .

no . i had some legal training , but ...

yeah ?

mister mulvaney ?

i 'm sorry .

i 'll be god damned if you will .

you tell me . is he endangering his health , because if you tell me he is , i 'll get him out .

do you think we can turn it on ?



they 'll shoot you ; the fucking cops 'll shoot you ... they do n't give a damn . in spite of that bank insurance . you see what they did in attica , they shot everybody , the hostages , prisoners , cops , guards , forty-two people they killed , the innocent with the guilty .

do n't ask me questions . i got connections . you find out who i am , you 're cold meat .

you got kids ?

mulvaney ...

now , you -- what 's your name ?

where 's the back door ?

you 're goin ' outside with me . if there 's no cops around , we just split . otherwise , you go with us .

gim me the keys to get outta here !

what 's the matter with you ?

well , you get your mind right . i 'm a catholic and i do n't wan na hurt nobody , but goddamn it , do n't you play no games with me . unnastand ? ! ?

hey ... let him out !

i 'm glad it 's okay .

thanks again , sam .

what is it , sam ?

i told you , he 's got diabetes .

i did n't eat any pizza .

howard !

did you always call him junior .

no , not until after they killed him .

oh , a long time . because i kept asking my husband where the heck could junior be ? he was n't around here . i thought maybe he was in prison or some place .

when was the last time you saw sal ?

your body is the temple of the lord .

go ahead . do what you want to do . i hate to see you break a perfect record . you oughta take care of your body .

for god 's sake ! as soon as i 'm outta this bank robbery , i 'm gon na stop ... okay ?

no ! i 'm not kidding . do n't you understand ? you 're pure !

because i do n't want cancer .

you do n't smoke ... why do you want to start now .

all right .

why could n't he talk about that here ?

what 'd he say ?

sal ?

they keep sayin ' two homosexuals . i 'm not a homosexual . i want you to stop them saying that .

yeah ...

does that still go ?

sal , i 'm sorry about this . but we can get outta this thing . there 's a way outta this .

you mean that ?

it 's the cops . shit !

where 's the money ?

ah , jesus ...

you ca n't allow ! i 'm running this thing , what gives you the idea you can say shit ? come on . i 'll pay you . whatta you want ? two hundred ? a thousand ?

it 's my mother . who needs this shit ?

the manager , he 's diabetic , he 's lookin ' bad .

what 's wrong ?

nobody give their right name ... it 's the fbi !

i want them all .

i 've got a jet . i 'll have airport limousine here in a half hour . i want the hostages .

goodbye , honey . wish us luck !

hey , you okay ?

listen , i 'll never make it . i 'll have to go to the toilet .

he 's right . you shoulda done what he did . go home . do n't talk to the fbi anymore .

did pop come down ?

no !

maybe ...

oh . run .

i ca n't , mom . if i come out sal will kill them .

and if you ca n't deliver them ?

yesterday i received an e-mail from a source . in this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit california driver 's licenses to my company late last night .

yep .

i became a bounty hunter because of cunts like you . i remember all the cunts in high school who were mean to me . eventually ... they all grew up to be just like you . angry and bitter because they peaked early ... and now they 're stuck in some dead end marriage ... or worse yet ... an unfulfilling job that keeps them from meeting a man .

< i > now the bitch was getting personal. < /i >

show me the tapes . i want to see them .

what was your business with lateesha that day ?

he 's a reality television producer . his name is mark weiss .

you then learned where the thieves had hidden the money ... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself .

you 're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself ... and it 's not working . i said i 'd tell you everything i know . you and your friends behind the mirror .

< i > mescaline. < /i > < b > int . cast winnebago -- night < /b > domino and the others are all drinking coffee . alf stares out through the windshield at the glow of vegas in the distance .

< i > either this was some kind of set up ... or the first ladies got scared ... decided to pull out and cut their losses. < /i >

you really think so ?

i know .

mookie 's ok .

i did n't think so .

mookie , you 're fucking up .

sal 's famous pizzeria , yeah , two large pizzas , pepperoni and anchovies , hold on ... see , pop , mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders . he 's making us lose business .

yeah , no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner .

pino , relax , will ya .

whaddup ?

you 're it .

no , i 'm not it .

then i 'm in . just like jerk-off .

but i came here to learn about america .

okay .

coming .

she says that she 's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened .

would you like something to drink ?

you and lloyd chose the class ! ?

a-ha ! i had a feeling it was all a fake .

harry !

yes , you and the whole special needs class .

hey guys .

harry dunne .

four colors ? neato !

depends how you define 'new ' ...

oh , yeah . i do n't think they do . you 're new here , right ?

you 're going to be just fine , harry .

i 'm just not ready .

yes , harry . i ca n't home school you anymore . so maybe it 's time to make some new friends , some friends your own age ...

i know .

you take her .

that 's the one i wanted .

damn ! what are the odds ?

right .

hey there goes principal collins !

oh , good . there 's jessica .

roger that , wilco .

guys , this is much better .

put a fork in me harry , lets get started .

ready lloyd ?

yes . screw george washington . just like marilyn monroe did .

that 's what jessica was talking about !

that 's because captain rob is not a pirate . we 've been through this .

maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it . put it on .

it was a diamond and you swallowed it .

i lugged it all over town !

you thinking what i 'm thinking ?

hey , look . ice cream .

now it makes total sense why she did n't want him to know we were in his office the other night .

hey , it 's jessica .

am not .

if you have to ask , you do n't know .

who ?

no . what happened ?

by the way , did captain rob mention how i beat the crap out of him this afternoon ?

me , me , me !

oh , telling inside jokes now , are we ? that 's it . you 're out of the cool crowd . next time turk 's passing out wedgies , you ai n't gettin ' one .

go away , assface .

so , have you given him `` some '' yet ?

i kinda screwed things up .

you ca n't marry my mom .

you and me ? dream on , desperado .

i do n't know . i have n't decided yet .

how do you know it 's for us ?

what ?

my head is suddenly killing me . maybe it 's from all the learning today .

maybe i should go home and grade papers . owwww .

they ca n't be real .

i did n't know that .

... and who was benjamin franklin again ?

what 's with horse-boy , now he 's a bright shiny sun ?

now you see why he was elected principal ?

shut up lloyd . you 're not married yet .

i will stop this car right now .

do n't use that tone with me , young man .

exactly ! a pirate !

what ? no no . he 's got a parrot on his shoulder , buries treasure ...

sounds like a pirate .

no ! captain rob is seven feet tall , wears an eye patch , got a hook for a hand ...

go fish .

maybe we should ask jessica to join the class .

harry , what are you doing ? she 's a foreign exchange student . she does n't speak the english . ching chong ching chingy chingy chong chong .

the second r is silent .

h a r r y ...

can we eat there tomorrow ?

the principal .

why not ?

no , it 's a treasure map .

is that what i think it is ?

me too !

no thanks , not hungry . harry dunne . why does that name not sound familiar ?

your mom is the tooth fairy ? that is so cool !

so can i come along ?

i do n't know what you 're talking about .

i 'm going to ask you one last time and if i do n't get an answer , i do n't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least . where 's my chest , jessica ?

not to expect you tonight .

oh i think you do .

poor question . too wordy . a good question gets right to the point . example , where 's my chest ?

you had some questions .

and , ching chong , you 're not a special needs kid . you 're just a foreign exchange student .

you 're just jealous .

being a jerk does n't make you special .

`` my dream date with principal collins . ''

harry 's treasure chest ? sure . i know where that is .

... if i may quote the twentieth century poet - joe piscahpo : you look marvelous ...

that 's it . i 'm done .

me too . i 'm almost there .

let 's just do it and get out of here .

so no small talk ? good , 'cause i do n't know how to make that . yep . small talk . not for me . not a fan . got any hobbies ? how 'bout this weather ?

i know , you want go for a ride .

you know , `` some '' . the fag stuff .

oh harry 's doing just fine , he 's just about to open up .

this school 's never had one before . i 'd like to talk to you and all your special friends .

you can bring whatever you want , little friend .

it 's too close to call . okay next contest , now lets ...

how was that ?

oh yeah , give it to me .

oh honey , i would n't miss this for the world .

hey can be on top ?

he passed away three years ago .

thanks for the grub , mrs. d. where 's mr. d ?

senior year . my little boy . who woulda thunk it ? you 're a good kid , lloyd . i do n't say it enough , but i 'm proud of you son .

obviously .

that 's not bad . how about a float of george washington crossing the delaware ?

sorry , ms. heller . i think they 're used to me teaching .

no .

your assignment is to pick the class . find some other students just as special as you .

no , it actually fit quite nicely . well , except for the fact that it was n't really as long as it was wide .

ha ! too big to make the turn !

you bet i left him , took the dog and we was history .

but we do n't drink from the house do we .

sure you can . we got ta nail this guy . you 'll be fine .

yes . so as soon as zimmer shows up , we 'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything .

are you going to kill her ?

okay , i 'll take care of jessica .

she 's been snooping around a lot , asking questions .

jessica . are you sure ?

the evidence of what ?

what papers ?

oh , things . photos . tapes . i tape everything that goes on in this office .

what ?

knock knock .

and ... ?

i think you 'll make a good teacher .

times two .

maybe someday . aloha cold weather , aloha hot weather .

we start our own class ?

how baby-cakes ? you 've done it all .

and i you .

the atreides will be leaving caladan soon , baron , and i have here your answer from duke leto .

my lord !

what 's that you 're saying ?

the carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester . try and get in close over the harvester ... you 'll find this interesting sire . -- the duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester . paul can see ...

they are fremen suits . i hope they fit well , my lord .

this is my son , paul .

i shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we 're finished .

do not interrupt ! ! ! do not speak lightly of the spice ... one small point ...

yes .

i see two great houses -- house atreides , house harkonnen -- feuding ... i see you behind it .

the duke is to be addresses as ... -- kynes comes forward and adjusts the duke 's suit , checking seals and pulling on straps .

play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders ...

if you 'd fought one whit below your abilities i 'd have scratched you a good one .

is this what you seek ?

perhaps these are the ones mapes told us of .

here is why this fremen has taken service with me , to ask that one question . delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer . shadout is chakobsa ... knife , in chakobsa is ... maker of death . it 's a maker ...

do you know this my lady ?

yes ...

remember ... walk without rhythm and we wo n't attract a worm ... it 'll go to the thumper .

the spice ! it 's in everything here . the air , the soil , the food ... it 's like the truthsayer drug ... .. it 's a poison ! ! ! ! you knew the spice would change me . but thanks to your teachings it 's changed my consciousness . i can see it ... i can see it .

a million deaths are not enough for yueh ...

no .

you 've worn a stillsuit before ?

are you a fremen ?

the water of life .

greater than treasure , usul . we have thousands of such caches . only a few of us know them all . when we have enough ... we shall change the face of arrakis . listen ! ...

you must n't speak of ...

mother ! tell me !

i have heard of it . -- reverend mother it is very dangerous ... very painful . the bene gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within ... . there is a place terrifying to us ... to women . it is said a man will come ... the kwisatz haderach ... he will go where we can not ... many men have tried ...

the person who can be many places at once ... the one who bridges space and time ... . he will look where we can not .

it burns .

the voice again .

pain .

yes . perhaps he would at that .

`` beg to differ ? ! '' hey , i 'm talkin ' about my duplex in burbank !

uh , beg to differ .

say , that 's a funny place to sleep .

mr. < u > lugosi < /u > ! it is an unparalleled privilege to meet you . allow me to introduce myself ... i am criswell !

i know none of < u > my < /u > wives would 've .

did you see that kid grab vampira 's tits ?

has anyone ever been to downey ?

okay . but what if i 'm not in < u > too < /u > big a hurry ? what if i take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life ? to smell a flower ?

no , you look good . and the tests came back fine . c'mon ...

do n't you have any savings ?

i was thinking about killing myself .

why are you here ? ?

eddie , this is quite a scene .

alright ! let 's put it on film . camera ! sound !

do you know i turned down `` frankenstein '' ?

okay ! how do we turn this thing on ?

fuck you ! < u > you < /u > come out here . hey , toss me that j.d .

let 's shoot this fucker ! where do i go ?

correct . so instead , i stayed here , waiting for my comeback . always hoping ... the next film , the next film ... that would be the one .

i did n't know if it was a trick . they might arrest me and throw me in a gulag . i am hungary 's most famous emigrant . they 'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave .

bela , do n't worry . you 're better than all this crap .

no bela , that 's `` incorporates . '' look , just say `` this casket has ... ''

`` beg to differ . this casket incarpratates , er , inporporates -- ''

`` it is my home . ''

`` greetings . i am slick slomopavitz , seeker of adventure . '' audience laughs . applause . `` say , that 's a funny place to sleep . ''

`` greetings . i am the count . ''

do n't worry . i 'll do something .

is there anything i can get you ? water ? a blanket ?

nah . this happens all the time ...

let me take you to the hospital .

but we need to start off with a bang ! something we < u > know < /u > the audience will want to see . mmm . what was your biggest hit ?

who do i play ?

but , i do n't like horses . do i have to get on one ?

uh , eddie , do you have my money ?

of course ! well , we got a big day planned for you ... first , we 're gon na start off a little easy , with you in that armchair over there . then , once you 're up to speed and cooking , we 'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --

do n't worry . i do it every halloween .

are you sure this is okay ?

well ... i guess i should go . perhaps we could get together again ?

the pure horror , it both repels and attracts them . because in their collective unconsciousness , they have the agony of childbirth . the blood . the blood is horror .

i apologize . when i play dracula , i put myself into a trance . it takes me much time to re-emerge .

you know , i saw you perform `` dracula . '' in poughkeepsie , in 1938 .

who are you ? what do you want ?

excuse me , mr . lugosi ? ?

if you say so .

ssh ! he 's so big ! he 's a < u > monster < /u > ! can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie ?

so guess where i 'm going next weekend ?

i mean i ca n't see the difference . i 'm color-blind . but i like the dark gray one .

which one < u > is < /u > the red one ?

um , okay ... roll camera

no ! it has to be underwater !

what do you think you 're doin ' ? !

nothin ' ! i told him he was great .

absolutely ! it 's just the beginning . i promise this : if we stick together , one day i 'll make every single one of you famous .

this is the big moment ... !

i got the early edition ! it was just dropped off at the newsstand .

my pleasure . i 'm always happy to assist in a little larceny .

bravo ! bravo ! magnifico !

i do n't understand .

wow .

did you really mean those things you said.. ?

oh . er ... well you 're the file clerk . you 're hurrying into the next room , when you bump into janet .

that 's tony mccoy . he 's playing lieutenant dick craig .

i see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here . say , who 's the lug ?

< u > i did n't dump you < /u > ! get it through your skull -- i just recast the part !

that 's a good reason to dump your girlfriend .

look , how many times can i say i 'm sorry ? i blew it ! i thought she was rich .

the secretary . or the file clerk .

i 'm sorry ! what did you want me to say ?

do n't get angry at me . maybe you just need a day job .

ed , the landlord called again . he wants his money .

i do n't know . it 's so much money ...

ed , who is daniel davis ?

say it a little louder . i do n't think bela heard you in his trailer .

oh , just like in the script !

oh ! you got nerve , buddy .

of course it is . and that 's why you should play the part .

and what about this so-called `` barbara '' character ? it 's obviously me ! i 'm so embarrassed ! this is < u > our < /u > < u > life < /u > !

since i was a kid . my mom wanted a girl , so she used to dress me in girlie clothing . it just kinda became a habit .

it 's a shame . he 's such a rest actor , and nobody uses him anymore .

boris karloff ! ?

better than not getting a job ?

ed , you 're still young . this is the part of your life when you 're < u > supposed < /u > to be struggling .

orson welles was 26 when he made `` citizen kane . '' i 'm already 30 !

you misunderstood . i gave you everything i have in the world : three-hundred dollars .

what other sixty-thousand ?

what are you looking at me like that for ? i already gave you my three hundred .

oh my , this is very interesting . say ... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts ?

so my associate mr. marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture .

yes . hollywood is oh so exciting .

yeah ? well now he 's a junkie . he do n't deserve to work .

< u > dr . acula < /u > !

doctor acula ? i do n't get it .

nobody in town has seen it , so i 'm givin ' you first crack at my talents .

screen classics ? hmm , do n't know them .

wood ? ward ? wood . hey , what do you know . it < u > is < /u > wood . dang secretaries , you can never get a good one . right ?

it 's wood . ed wood .

yes ?

look , lugosi is dead and vampira wo n't talk . ihad to give < u > somebody < /u > the dialogue .

yes , but i 've got the last footage he ever shot !

what is happening ?

but i thought me and dolores had something .

do n't worry . you just have n't met right woman yet . oopsy . that cabbage goes right through me .

i 'd be happy too , if i had such a great family .

uh , i do n't have much of an appetite lately .

okey-dokey .

here 's the scene . loretta , you 're in a trance . you glide in and get on the operating table . now tor , you 're supposed to tie her down . but you have an angora fetish ... and when you rub that swatch of angora , it makes you refuse so bela has to discipline you .

but greta say --

tor !

glad you could fit me in your schedule .

it is when it works . you know the one film of mine i can stand to watch ? `` kane . '' the studio hated it ... but they did n't get to touch a frame . ed , visions are worth fighting for . why spend your life making someone else 's dreams ?

it 's the damn money men . you never know who 's a windbag , and who 's got the goods . and then they all think < u > they 're < /u > a director ...

oh . um , i 'm ed wood ! so , what are you working on now ?

uh , uh , i 'm a young filmmaker , and a really big fan ... and i just wanted to meet you .

yes ?

screw you , wood ! i even sunk more money into different titles : `` transvestite '' `` he or she ? '' `` i led two lives '' ... it does n't matter ! nobody wants to see the piece of shit .

i did . i established some tits and ass .

yeah ? whatever . so did you like it ?

< u > then how 's it gon na get in the < /u > < u > picture < /u > ? !

so change the poster . trust me , you 'll be better off . this is a story that 's gon na < u > grab < /u > people . it 's about this guy . he 's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses . should he tell her ? should he not tell her ? he 's torn . george , this is drama .

i thought this was gon na be a sex- change film !

yeah ! < u > lugosi < /u > !

what if i told you you could have a star for $ 1000 ? ?

eddie , you must have me confused with david selznick . i do n't make major motion pictures . i make crap .

no , of course i 'm gon na make the movie ! i 've already presold alabama and oklahoma . those repressed okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff . so we 'll just make it without that she-male . we 'll fictitionalize it .

but it 's pouring . and the car top is stuck !

let 's get married .

ed , i 'm so happy for you .

no , bigger ! what 's the biggest energy ? ?

no . they 're beyond that ! they 're smarter than the humans . what 's < u > more < /u > advanced ?

the left . it 's more natural . hey , i 've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb . what would that be made of ?

i might as well be . i made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see . i blew it . all he wanted was a comeback ... that last glory ...

bela died .

thanks . it 's actually the only thing i know how to make . hey , can you grab that strainer ?

ed , this spaghetti sauce is delicious .

huh ?

you 're not gon na believe the first picture i ever saw . your friend 's .

no . i 'm from back east . you know , all-american small town ... everybody knew everybody , i was a boy scout , my dad worked for the post office ...

i just picked them up on the way over ...

oh , hi .

oh . congratulations .

you do n't wan na be noticed ?

i know what < u > that 's < /u > like . anyway , i brought a copy of the script . you would play the `` ghoul 's wife . ''

it 's the same film . but the distributor wanted a punchier title . c'mon ! it 's gon na be a big event -- we 're going all out ! bela , tor , and cris are coming . you 'll have fun !

please ! it 'll only take a minute . you can have some hors d'oeuvres , and meet my backers ! there 's a really nice dentist from oxnard ...

no . i think my film is perfect for you .

that was karloff . paul , you got ta try harder . i do n't want this film to be haif-assed . this time , we go for the quality .

here 's to ed . for making us into something .

mr. wood ? < u > what do you think you 're < /u > < u > doing < /u > ? !

nooooo ! ! !

what the heck is this ? ! !

you know , you 're a very attractive girl .

no , i work in pictures . i 'm a director-actor-writer-producer .

i suppose . it 's very expensive .

who ?

vampira ! hi , this is ed wood .

i 'm moving out .

yes !

al ! !

i 'm not -- i did n't -- al , you know how i feel about you ...

they celebrated the common person .

come on ...

at what point ?

no ! do they show you having sex ?

no . the bathroom is off limits -and when i go to sleep they go to other programming . unless i get up . then they go back on the air . unless i get up to go to the bathroom , i guess , then -

you know it .

if ray would steal this girl from ed . that would be great .

what ?

you know what would be great ?

i do n't think so .

you said a woman likes to be pursued .

yeah , that 's why i called . i mean , maybe fed-ex would tell me where she moved --

sure .

could we just talk alone for a second ? i --

um , yeah -- thanks .

i want you to take this .

okay , so you understand ? we 're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom , one in the kitchen , one in the living room , plus , of course , there 'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you .

ed , can i see you a second .

where are you going ?

is n't this getting kind of pathetic . i mean we drank the juice , now we 're just licking peel . let it go !

i polled my staff . the men say they 'd hang around with him and the women say he 's fuckable . and one of the men said he 's fuckable .

very quick . between you and me , it 's not a bad way to go . making love to your wife ... it 's very sweet .

what about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick ? i 'd hate to think he ...

yes ?

when ? today ?

yeah . you did good . what 's wrong ?

yeah , what - they put some schmuck on tv all day long or something ?

oh , that thing . yeah . did you hear about this ?

i 'm gon na stick this right in your eye .

we 're the guys who clean up after the parade .

we 're falling behind .

you said that .

look at this -- people are getting married , they 're getting married ...

what ?

apparently , neither can hank . what the hell did you do to him ?

do you think it 's been easy for me ? it 's been years . al ca n't have sex .

oh my god ! on tv !

who ?

i 'm at the hospital .

mom ?

what 's the difference ?

she could 've been a nurse .

but what was that whole story about him and a nurse ?

he says --

oh my god ! !

mm .

i do n't know . she 's living with that `` entertainer '' ...

how 's marcia ? she all right ?

no ! i -- all right , look , if you hear from ray ... . tell him to call me , okay ?

look , ma , come on out . really . i need to talk to you .

no . it 's a mess .

send him away .

yeah . the camera guy is here .

she would n't tell me .

she left .

what is she , at work ?

look , if you do n't let me out of this ... i'11 just ... i'11 just sit in my apartment all day . i wo n't go anywhere , i wo n't do anything . what kind of show will that be ?

i can imagine . you said you wanted nothing to do with this . you swore to me . `` do n't come near me . do n't bring this into my life ... ''

oh ! oh -- okay , now i get it . it 's `` star search . '' you wanted me here because the camera comes with me .

our foibles , our foibles !

our what ?

he 's just ... trying a little too hard --

you batted or you bunted ?

but facts ! they have to be verified . anything from their past , their present , business , personal -- arrests , affairs ... and whoever comes up with the sleaziest , most degrading material -- i'11 give you ten thousand dollars . and you get to be on ed tv . hah ?

come on .

this is going right up your ass .

she lied to me . i mean all my life , she 's telling me one story and then ... it turns out to be a completely different story . come to me at some point -- tell me the truth . no . not in my house . the truth is a stranger . and this is why ray and marcia are the way they are . marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - `` how do they find me '' she says . ray cheats on you and then blames me for it . i 'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself ... oh , man ... are you all right ?

i feel like a criminal or , like we 're cheating on someone .

somewhere .

where ?

come on , let 's go .

a poll . `` is shari good enough for ed ? '' seventy-one per cent said `` no . '' they hate me !

ohh ...

look at this .

no . who ?

... yeah , then , but ...

i told you . if we ... you know do it , they go away until ... we 're done .

it 's quite an honor . will you come with me ?

you should see the one we wear when it rains .

what are you doing ?

weird ? if this happened last month it would 've been weird . now with ... the tv and ... now it 's just too weird .

oh god , this is so weird .

really ?

me too . i mean i 'm going out with ray and i 'm ... thinking about you .

really ?

no , no , i -- as soon as you came in tonight i said to john , `` boy shari looks beautiful . '' i said it on tv so you can ask anybody who saw it .

dynamite .

cream rinse ?

hey , believe me -1 know i 've got a great chance of making a fool of myself , here .

me ? ! that 's you !

yeah . my problem is i 've got a brother who writes a sentence like `` we grew up in a small , little bedroom . '' as opposed to a big , little bedroom ?

you know what your problem is ?

that 's right . you put cliff on television . so then he decided he was too good for her and he left .

me ? !

ray , come an --

what are we gon na fight ? ray , please , listen to me --

oh , man , i 've been trying to call you .

... ray ?

why me ?

`` quick pull off the highway '' is not a relationship . oh man , i got ta pee .

oh , jesus .

ray --

yeah . you know , piano bars . plays the piano and sings . that 's how they met .

no , this is great . you 'll love this . he 's a singer .

no . what happened ?

okay , i just wanted to get your attention . my name is ray and my friend bucky and i design video systems . you 've got an office or a big home , we'11 come out there design you an entire system .

you 're gon na be a video store clerk for the rest of your life ? this is your big ambition , rearranging the `` ernest '' movies ?

i 'm doing all right .

we 're excited .

yeah . i service video equipment .

no . ray sat on it . i'11 see you .

check forging .

quite a shithole , is n't it ?

no . am i supposed to ?

hi .

ohh ... do you own a cat ?

good ?

how ?

what happened ? you described this `` crazy-kooky '' family who 'd be a million laughs on tv ?

oh , an tv a minute and already an attitude .

sign here , please .

pierde .

tu

you 're not just jealous , are you ? i mean , we both used to talk about her

dave , i 'm just saying this as your friend . what you 're doing is really , really wrong , and you 've got to stop .

yeah , it 's serious . i mean she inspires me in ways sherry never has . she even wants to read my novel .

you could tell dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place , and that could get a little irritating sometimes , but basically he was a real good guy .

here , get down .

it was the first time somebody ever saw the real me , the me that nobody else knows .

what kind of person ?

what ?

you know , tracy ... i do n't know how to say this , but ...

yeah . no . i mean , you know .

how 'd it go ?

yeah , just --

you gon na do it ? you gon na do it ?

thank god for diane . she was my best friend , my source of love and strength . oh sure , we 'd had our share of bumpy times , but we 'd always seen them through . after nine years of marriage , we were closer than ever . and the secret ? good communication .

so nice

do n't you smartass me ! do n't you dare smartass me ! you just shut your mouth i now your mother and i have had a long talk with halt hendricks -- - we just got off the phone with him at home . you know , he does n't want you back at millard . he 's fed up with you . fed up ! and i do n't blame him !

larry ? we 've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly , and we still have to do counts for vp , treasurer and secretary . mr. hendricks and i have both verified the numbers , and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -

but , they were there i counted 803 votes .

larry ?

you 're kidding , right ?

you will .

doing what ?

and this model comes with abs and dual air bags standard .

good for you . good for you

huh . right . college . wow . where are you going ? where 'd you get into ?

i agree . but i also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very , very grateful the whole school did n't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations , and chances to win certain elections .

why are you lecturing me ?

well , i do n't know . it could have been anybody . there are a lot of , you know , subversive elements around millard . you know , like rick thieson and kevin speck and those burn-outs . or doug schenken - what about him ? or what about tammy metzier ? her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that .

6:30. how do you know what time the posters were torn down ?

mr. m. , i am running on my qualifications . i would never need to resort to , you know , to vandalism like a , you know ... plus , my own best banner was torn down . did i do that too ?

wait - are you accusing me ? you 're not serious . i ca n't ... mr. mcallister , we have worked together on sga for three solid years and ... i mean , i ca n't believe it . i 'm ... i 'm shocked !

i guess you know why you 're here

so like i was saying , things were going pretty well in my life .

fuck me , mr. mcallister

okay . that 's good . i just wanted to make sure .

you bet .

no , that 's fine

are n't you supposed to keep them ?

could you approve them now ? i 'd like to kick off my campaign right away , you know , in the morning .

here they are .

not wasting any time , are you , tracy ?

that little bitch made a fool of us i want her out of the election . getting everybody all riled up like that . she 's finished , you hear me ? washed up .

thanks . well . i 'm going home now .

walt will be speaking with you about this , but i need you to find someone to take over my classes . the lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer .

walt needs to see you .

life would go on , and i would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience .

i do n't believe you .

which door ?

looks at her skeptically does n't say a word .

just wait outside . tammy .

a mistake ? that was no mistake .

it 's the only true thing i know anymore .

three twenty-five .

we 'll let it run awhile

shall we give it a name ?

points at the motel .

without dave around . sherry needed a lot of help around the house .

oh , okay . yeah , sorry .

no , wait -- apples . apples .

okay , let 's say

takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard .

and she 's super-nice

i 'm telling you . dr. hendricks , every vote was accounted for .

whoa ! easy , fouch . i do n't like where you 're going .

what ?

are you crazy ?

i 'm not like you .

where 're you going ?

sorry .

uhhh ... teeth . teeth .

thanks . you too . it was great working with you .

yes , paul ?

paul , will you sign my yearbook ?

yeah .

good luck to you too , paul .

huh ? oh , hi , tracy

who put you up to this ?

okay . great . i feel good .

sure , paul . no hard feelings .

so mr. m. calls me in and tells me --

yeah . so guess what happened . so mr. mcallister , he -- oh hi . lisa .

do n't you fucking knock ?

what 's it to you ?

how 's the left these days ?

come in out of the rain , bud .

i want to know about exley .

it 's bud .

i wondered when you might ring the bell again , officer white .

i do n't know .

he had you cut to look like veronica lake ?

i 'm not sure .

did they deserve it today ?

you say 'fuck ' a lot .

maybe i 'm just fucking curious .

how 'd she meet patchett ?

no i have n't . do you know why pierce is humoring you ?

somebody hit you ?

you 're perplexing to me these days , wendell . you 're not your old , cruel self anymore . i need proof that the extracurricular work i had planned for you remains within your grasp .

give me one minute .

they 're yours . take them .

he helped me out once . that 's all .

what 's going to happen to stensland ? he 'll give himself cirrhosis over this . < u > he 's one < /u > < u > year from his pension < /u > .

dudley , what do you want ?

say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables .

no . i 'll tell you sometime . not now . do n't want to jinx it . but it could take the edge off that jail time i got coming .

do n't look so down in the mouth , bud . you nailed him good .

yeah . a great big one .

no ! please leave !

maybe . i do n't know .

we were never properly introduced . susan and i were fighting that day . she called him by a nickname . muns or lunts or something .

what was that boyfriend 's name ?

tell me about the boyfriend she had . the one you mentioned at the morgue .

let my daughter rest in peace .

mrs. lefferts , i 'm officer white with the l.a.p.d . i 'd like to ask a couple of questions .

you know , all i ever wanted was to measure up to my father .

me ? you called it . i got a message that ...

you wanted to meet here ?

< u > lynn < /u > .

they did n't find the shotguns . they planted them .

she told you ?

how 's it going to look on your report ?

someone held up a coffee shop , panicked and killed six people .

what little studio ?

no .

i do n't have one . lefferts looked beat-up christmas eve , but did n't act it . how come ?

bullshit . where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin ?

i ai n't your < u > paesano < /u > , you wop cocksucker .

officer white . i heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters .

what do you mean ?

but she 's moving away from the door . who was sitting at this table ?

it looks like she was flailing , trying to get away .

you mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous ? i ca n't think of anything .

someone must 've pulled the records .

were you on hop ? you were passed out when you got arrested . were you hopped up , ray ?

say what ?

man , what 're you saying ?

man , why 're you talkin ' about larry ? his business is his business .

believed what ?

that fucking larry . i almost believed him .

gone . not a trace .

nobody . at least not yet .

they shot him in his library .

he runs call girls . primo tail . fixed up like movie stars .

and ?

it 's for your own safety . now what can you tell us about sergeant john vincennes ?

something like that .

why ?

jack was a shame , but dick stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin . through his whore girl friend . i sent him to make the buy . the rest is history .

tell that to jack vincennes . to stensland .

anonymous . probably nothing .

no ... where 'd the tip come from ?

there always are . but there are also three men and three guns . matched forensically . a few loose ends do n't matter .

edmund , you do n't want it and you ca n't have it .

sir , i took the call . it 's my case .

you should stay away from a man when his blood is up .

i know you mean well , dudley , but i do n't need to do it the way you did . or my father .

dudley , we 've been over this .

i was thinking detective bureau .

john , i doubt you 've ever drawn a stupid breath . do n't start now .

what 's fleur-de-lis ?

jesus ... maybe white 's not so dumb after all .

what 's that for ?

is there more to that , or do i have to guess ?

it 's a simple question .

listen , i think i made a mistake , too .

yesterday yes , today no . what happened last night ?

i want you to follow bud white .

glasses .

what ?

that 's right .

of his penis , sir ?

hold on ... we need to canvass . see if a purple mercury was seen around here tonight .

then try talking to my lawyer . good evening , gentlemen .

a vulgar term , but yes .

do you think i ever could 've been in the running ?

if i knew you were coming i 'd have baked a cake .

actually , bud 's only tough on the outside .

like recognizes like . i 'm pretty tough , myself .

no . this is the means to the reality . but i 'm not going to tell you what it is .

does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier ?

i 'll take your word for it .

i see bud because i want to . i see bud because he ca n't hide the warmth he has inside him .

you want to know what bud 's like in bed ?

how about white ?

oh , the best i ever had . absolutely the best .

how was i ?

what 's dudley 's scheme ?

do you have any proof ?

without what , his smearing yours first ? what 's he got on you , loew ? pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down ?

absolutely not . dudley smith is a highly decorated member of this city 's police department and i wo n't smear his name without --

it 's okay . these are police . < u > what < /u > do you want ?

i do n't doubt it -- oh , god .

a sweet man .

i put reynolds in the cab myself . the night cost me a hundred scoots and i got bupkis .

jesus . jack , that 's a story . 'swish actor gets the gay blade . ' let me get my camera .

he 's dead . i was just there . somebody slit his throat .

you did n't get my message ? it got called off . the kid chickened out at the last minute .

sid , cut the crap . i --

around .

he 's queer too . metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues . on screen and off . i 'm getting him to fuck the d.a . for a hundred bucks . that 's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career .

and reynolds ?

how 'd you like a little payback ? not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund . did you know loew was a swish ?

the grauman 's chinese pot bust . he just got off the honor farm .

you 're back , boychick .

something good ?

no . but i 've got something going with ad vice .

< u > hush-hush < /u > . off the record and on the q.t .

contract players at metro . you pinch 'em . i do you up feature in the next issue . plus the usual fifty cash . tell me , am i fucking santa claus ?

no , sergeant . i checked twice .

have we met before ?

oh ? anyplace else ?

he did n't give you an address ? he did n't give you a phone number ?

i 'm telling you , i --

do n't bullshit me , i can save your life .

and you were the last one to talk to him .

what happened ?

i do n't want any money . and believe me , i have no interest in ruining your life . i 'm not interested in this tape .

me neither , but the upshot is i 've got color live-action footage of you and ms hawkins and it does n't look good .

who else have you told ?

clear as day .

lem me ask you something . i put a bird feeder out in the yard , but the squirrels , they keep taking --

listen --

well considering what a colossal douche bag you are , david , maybe i 'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol .

i have a professional relationship with rachel banks . she 's the go- between for a private investigator i use .

except for the part about my setting up a company in zurich and knowing anyone named sam vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the gambino family .

pretty fast .

how fast can you learn ?

reynolds .

how ?

what if we just fucked with 'em ?

what if --

what if --

well how do < u > i < /u > know what they 're --

the area 's wired for surveillance , they 'll be < u > looking < /u > for those moves .

what if we hand deliver to their homes or office ?

listen to you , `` directly '' . you 're not gon na get < u > near < /u > the news department . and if you did , it 'd never get on the air . time-life buried the zapruder film for 15 years .

yeah , i can see where that 'd --

fuckin-a .

that was n't so hard .

they should n't have come without calling first .

them .

they 're here .

remember when senator hamersley died in an accident up near shenandoah ?

yeah . take a walk with me .

why 'd you leave ?

none of your business .

the nsa 's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40 's . they 've infected everything : banks , computers , phones , mail , name it . the more technology we buy into , the easier it is keeping tabs on us . it 's a brave new world . at least it better be .

oh , i 'll bet < u > that < /u > threw 'em off the scent . i sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice !

you do n't get it . they go through your phone records . they fuckin ' monitor everyone you called in the last --

you told me no calls .

move it .

how many years have < u > you < /u > been hiding from them ? how many years have you been running ? what 'd they do to you ?

i 'll pay you .

hey , if you live another week i 'll be impressed .

if i knew , they 'd be after < u > me < /u > . which they probably are right now . 'bye .

i do n't know what that means .

yeah .

what do they have to do with this ?

you 've heard of the national security agency ?

who was that other guy ?

my name 's neil . maybe i can help you .

baudmore consultants .

ah , sir , you know , it 's not for me to say .

dylan , i was just asking eric if --

i think she 'll like this very much .

i 'll say .

can you help me ?

it 's okay . i think it 's a wonderful gift .

i 'm married to my wife ... of several years ... and i 'd like to buy ... as a christmas present ...

i 'm married .

do you see anything you like ?

i know , but --

for your wife ?

no .

no .

i 'm happy to help you all i can . but i did n't see the accident and i barely knew daniel zavitz . i 've got ta go to work .

we 'd appreciate your cooperation .

somebody took my blender .

i 'm not his attorney .

are you invoking attorney/client privilege .

you tell me .

about the accident .

someone said you spoke to mr. zavitz before he died . i thought you might know something .

i was < u > in < /u > the store , the accident was outside . it was a bus .

oh ... yeah , i did n't see the accident .

they 're saying you killed that policeman .

the lingerie .

i wish you 'd gone to your parents like i asked you .

it was n't me .

i went to the bank to see why . they said you emptied our accounts --

i know , but listen --

leave this house .

oh , please --

it 's not true .

there 's just , clearly , some administrative snafu . i 'm sure this is the worst of it .

honey , i do n't like to talk about this stuff in front of eric .

what 'd you buy at harrison 's ?

i 'm sorry .

what do you mean ?

what ?

something bad happened tonight .

you should take this seriously .

right .

just for the criminals .

hey .

it 's a brand new card .

i 'm sorry , sir , this card 's been declined .

good news there , mr. depinto , you 're talking to one .

that 's probably not you in the picture . i tell you what , i 'll just run the thing by the grand jury , see if they ca n't --

you do n't know who the fuck --

i 'd like to speak to someone about what 's happening to me .

you being audited ?

i know .

there are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long i 've worked for the mob . the < u > mob < /u > , bobby !

why ?

i got a call from my firm this morning saying do n't come in .

thank you .

you 're not .

he does n't work that way .

yes .

that was n't the answer i was hoping for .

you 're wrong .

who < u > are < /u > you people ?

hey !

shut the fuck up .

fuck off .

a leave of absence . until we 've sorted this all out .

well until we find , you 're gon na have to take a leave of absence .

merry christmas , son .

the union 's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now .

i 'm sorry , mr. dean . but larry 's in st. lukes now , so i 'm a little -- i 'm not myself . the union bosses say unless we take bellmoth 's offer , it 'll only get worse .

where 's stacy ?

i 'm not goin ' anywhere , eric . i live here .

how long can you stay ?

yeah .

no . we 're never getting a divorce . we were having a fight . it happens sometimes .

do i know you ?

he 's kidding .

you staying for dinner ?

excuse me , have any of you seen an eight year old boy , good looking , about yea-big .

jerry ?

to the nsa . make a deal . tell 'em to stop . tell 'em i do n't have what they 're after . make a deal .

you got ta --

listen to me .

my stuff 's all over her apartment .

calm down .

christ !

jerry --

that 's what i want to talk to you about ?

can i talk to you a second ?

they only took electrical appliances .

i love my blender .

why do n't you give 'em a call .

usually they take clothes .

no .

are you still in crystal city ?

how can i reach you ?

it 's me , robert dean . from seth , silverberg . i worked on --

you think there was a connection to --

yeah .

zavitz had digital compression equipment . he could 've downloaded into something . a disk , a chip , anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with . whatever he put it in , he dropped it in that bag .

i 'm not asking you to say for certain . this is what you 're trained to do , right ?

there are planes falling out of the sky , buildings blowing up . < i > american < /i > buildings . < i > americans < /i > getting bombs in the mail . what are we gon na do ! ?

found him . kent island nailed the call five minutes ago . he 's stationary .

and if it was n't ?

and they have the video . that 's confirmed .

yes sir .

we found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of brill 's studio . one was dean 's . the other , we believe , belongs to brill .

i just meant --

he 's clever . he had help .

it was in his bag . now it 's not .

what about the tapes ?

what happened ?

for daniel zavitz . i just need a signature .

yes ?

the fuck do you have goin ' on with sam albert ?

no .

every night i cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again .

thank you . will you bury geoffrey ? i know he 's dead .

do you promise ? i would n't want to die here . i would n't want to die in the desert . i 've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind , with particular hymns . very english . and i know exactly where i want to be buried . in our garden . where i grew up . with a view of the sea . so promise me you 'll come back for you .

shall we be all right ?

do n't leave me !

i know . i 'm sorry . i 'll make a fire . i 'll be back .

we 've got to get you out of here .

would you let me pass ?

i 'm not agreeing . do n't think i 'm agreeing , because i 'm not .

shall we be all right ?

of course . you did n't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you 'd slapped my face .

i thought we were against ownership ? i can stay tonight .

you bastard , i was believing you !

say you 're feeling faint - the sun .

what do i love ? i love rice pudding , and water , the fish in it , hedgehogs ! the gardens at our house in freshwater - all my secret paths .

now .

a woman should never learn to sew , and if she can she should never admit to it . close your eyes .

you do n't sew at all !

find that plant . cut out its heart .

oh my god , the others !

all true . herodotus , your friend , tells of a wind - the simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress , their swords raised .

yes . absolutely .

look over there .

i 'd like you to have them .

you sing . all the time .

he said - be careful .

sounds perfectly clear . where does the ostrich come in ?

excuse me ?

i should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this . i apologize if i appear abrupt . i am rusty at social graces . how do you find cairo ? did you visit the pyramids ?

this is not worth eight pounds , mrs. clifton .

excuse me ?

which stall ?

yes , thank you , gyges , son of daskylus - candaules said to him i do n't think you believe me when i tell you how beautiful my wife is . and although gyges replied he did find the queen magnificent the king insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women . do you all know this story ?

i 'm sorry - what have you noticed ?

i ca n't sing . but i can tell a story . i might need a prompt . do you have your herodotus ? i 've noticed you carry it

a thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it . big car , slow car , chauffeur-driven car , still a car .

i have n't , no . sorry .

i 've known katharine since she was three , my aunt is her aunt , we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife . i think i 'd know what is and what is n't too much for her . i think she 's know herself .

you too . good luck !

uxoriousness - that 's my favorite kind of love . excessive love of one 's wife .

i understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while i radio back to hq -

look , listen to me . a woman is dying - my wife ! - is dying seventy miles from here . i have been walking for three days ! i do n't want to spell my name , i want you to give me this jeep !

yes , of course . so , golly , where have you come from ?

yes . it was . thanks for the compass . i 'll look after it for you .

good , we 're all here ? a toast , to the international sand club - may it soon resurface .

own the desert .

no , because you ca n't see from the air ! if you could explore from the air life would be very simple ! look ! what is that ? is that a wadi ? that whole spur is a real possibility

bermann !

cut the ropes . i left a note , on his blanket . at the next geographical society i shall await with great interest the announcement of the fenelon-barnes slave knot . the girl would n't leave , of course . her father had sold her for a camel . he turns over the propeller , the engine cranks up .

that 's your name innit ? count fucking arsehole von bismarck ? what 's that supposed to be then , irish ?

please - i beg you , i beg you , i beg you , please listen to me , this is a terrible mistake . just stop , please , and listen to me . my wife is dying .

you 're the prettiest girl i ever saw .

your leg will be fine . a lot of shrapnel came out - i saved you the pieces .

oh jesus . oh jesus christ .

or was it toronto ?

i slept with the girl . i 've got a wife in tripoli . a girl comes up and points at you , you only see trouble .

it 's impossible . i was buying or selling something . i 've been to cairo many times .

i do n't know .

is this you ?

petty thief , six months imprisonment kingston penitentiary , 1937 .

no .

david caravaggio .

no-one should own music . the real question is who wrote the song ?

i do n't know what that means .

ask him .

who are his ghosts ?

i 'm okay . look , it 's a big house . we need n't disturb each other . i can shoot a pistol ! i 'll sleep in the stables . i do n't care where i sleep . i do n't sleep .

no .

what did you say ?

you were the only man who knew the desert well enough , the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing .

before you went over to the germans , before you got rommel 's spy across the desert and inside british headquarters . he took some pretty good photographs - i saw mine in that torture room in tobruk , so they made an impression .

me ?

well , anything you do is likely to be fatal , so you know -

top hat .

i do n't even know if it is my book . the bedouin found it in the plane , in the wreckage . it 's mine now . i heard your breathing and thought it might be rain . i 'm dying for rain - of course i 'm dying anyway - but i long to feel rain on my face .

and you 've forgotten yours .

me ? you 've got the wrong end of the stick , old boy . so - caravaggio - hana thinks you invented your name .

what ?

are n't you ?

darling , i just heard . you poor sausage , are you all right ?

well , she is !

darling , for goodness ' sake !

but then the queen looked up and saw gyges concealed in the shadows . and though she said nothing , she shuddered . the next day she sent for gyges and challenged him . and hearing his story , she said this -

and a special thank you to geoffrey and katharine , without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels . they toast the cliftons .

very much so . we are all , save my friend here .

marvelous plane . did you look ?

i do n't think it does . anyway , he 's indifferent to me .

i 've been told that before .

my mother always told me i would summon my husband by playing the piano .

k is for katharine .

could i ask you to move ? i 'm sorry - but when you turn , the sheets , i ca n't really bear the sheets moving over me . sorry .

he keeps asking me questions about you . do you know him ? do you recognize him ?

are you remembering more ?

zerzura , the white city of acacias , the oasis of little birds . as me about the scent of acacia - it 's in this room . i can smell it . the taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth . i can taste it . i 'm chewing the mint . is there sand in my eyes ? are you cleaning sand from my ears ?

i 'm turning you .

i should try and move your bed . i want you to be able to see the view . it 's good , it 's a view from a monastery .

are you asleep ?

thank you .

i 'm not sewing anything else for you !

hana , i know you do !

i know - here i am always a brown man , there you would be always a white woman .

kip i -

of course . when ?

will you come with me ?

when i went to england i was amazed at what went on , the waste - i 'd been taught to re-use everything , the dung from a cow to cool a radiator , a fork to fix a typewriter - india could live for a hundred years on what i saw thrown away .

then i 'd think there must be a reason .

you loved him .

yes . later .

actually , you ca n't cut , can you ? you 'll fall over . give me the pliers .

what is this business with you and explosives ? do you think you 're immune ?

so i follow the wires ?

i did n't like that book either . it 's all about men . too many men . just like this house .

i do n't think so .

oh god . oh god .

third canadian fusiliers .

if anything happened to you i 'd never forgive myself .

the war 's over - you told me yourself . how can it be desertion ?

i was looking for the lieutenant singh .

i 'll ask the lieutenant . but thank you .

since caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear , so please .

i was going to say - if you want to eat with us , ever you and lieutenant singh

hello .

you 've got a mustache .

i 'd like to spend a night with you in a bed .

i 've got a surprise . a boat ! we can go to capri . it 's got a cabin , it 's private .

yessir .

do n't move ! stand absolutely still ! hana stops .

certainly not .

i 'm afraid we 're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition .

it does n't matter . really . i think i can muddle through . okay - the story of candaules and gyges . king candaules was passionately in love with his wife - one day he said to gyges , the son of somebody , anyway - his favorite warrior -

you should sit down , darling . she 's quite all right . are you pregnant ?

what i really object to , uncle , is your finishing all my condensed milk . and the message everywhere in your book - however slowly i read it - that the best destiny for india is to be ruled by the british .

so what do you really object to - the writer or what he 's writing about ?

then you were married ?

no .

why ? are you german ?

he 's on to something bigger .

gin ? where the hell are you ?

do n't overestimate yourself .

you do n't call , you do n't write .

i 'd need an introduction . from someone he trusts . someone who owes us a favor .

how would you approach him ? hello , mr. macdougal , i 'm gin , would you steal a painting with me ?

why did n't i think of that ?

yeah . me .

give me a break . remember manzini ? when he stole montezuma 's scepter he left a pepto bismal bottle . the best ones always copy mac .

put the bolts on that window under a scope , i 'm betting you 'll find wrench scratches on them .

meaning --

you ordering chop suey again ?

that 's great if you 're a computer . in the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds . the building 's 600 feet high .

the windows do n't open .

where were you ? i called at 4:30 this morning .

you mean the seven billion .

both sides of the street , i 'm afraid .

what about you ?

but --

nothing is wrong . everything is the way it has to be . in my left coat pocket is a packet . passports , hotel reservations , tickets .

what 's wrong .

i 'm not leaving without you .

no , you ca n't .

hang on .

you can do it .

jesus god , it 's going through .

i 'm leaving from the nathan road station at 6:30 tomorrow morning . you could come too .

that 's because you grew up rich .

nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention .

no . you 'll see when we get inside .

two men in the world do n't need passwords or codes . their retinas will scan to unlock everything . one of those two men is the chairman of the bank .

for god 's sake , the only way i can get from one elevator to the other is to jump .

there 's no way to practice this . and no time . besides , i 've planned it all . there are n't any surprises .

you 're out of your mind . we ca n't do a job like this with no rehearsal .

we 're doing it tonight .

that 's where the mask comes in .

transfer .

you 're being useless . i 'm making us rich .

my job , my rules .

you took the rembrandt , i figured it was a fair trade .

there 's food in the fridge . i wo n't be long .

i 'll need the rembrandt now .

hold the record . alone .

my eighty , your twenty , smart guy --

speaking of money . you said billions . how many ?

you do n't know the half of it .

we 're living history here .

the big job .

you 're playing both sides of the street . you 're going to keep the mask and turn me in .

now 's when you tell me who you really are .

we did it .

behind you .

they moved it .

we 're working .

in eye of that painting .

to our ... partnership .

to us . to the mask .

little celebration before we set off .

certainly the most beautiful crook i 've ever seen .

thank you .

that 's it . we 're ready .

got it .

oh , i think you can do it . probably .

no one < u > needs < /u > anything except food and shelter . the rest we just want .

you need a partner for this job . you 'll never find one as good as me .

no , dammit ! i mean me ! that rembrandt ... that rembrandt !

this is n't some picasso print you steal out of a car dealer 's rec room .

pack up . i 'll see you get back to london .

you do n't get the mask code unless i go .

we ? are you implying that i 'm taking you inside ?

so the duke dug a tunnel -- just in case . they made the lake a hundred years later . flooded the tunnel .

nice spot .

why are we in separate -- you know , separate rooms ?

i guess i have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do .

hmmm . i 'd be surprised if you could .

you really do n't believe i 'd take on a partner after all these years without a little ... insurance ?

i do n't believe this .

no . entrapment is what cops do to robbers .

where 's my bag ?

what about your bags ?

i 'm not the one to ask ...

you what -- ?

what the hell was that ?

damn , i knew i forgot something .

look on the back . what do you see ?

how much am i paying ?

i suspected it might be worthy of your interest .

somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on .

the most important piece of chinese art outside of china .

i 'm sorry . this just means so much to me .

for god 's sake .

well , no ... but ...

are you under the impression that now i 'm in some way obligated to you ?

not interested .

we were , we are , but this is perfect for you .

oh , that 's quite all right . no charge .

no . why would i be ?

so alive .

maybe the thief thought you had something valuable . you are in the business , that 's what roki says .

yes . but they do n't have a clue . why would anyone steal my luggage ?

it was only a scratch . far more damaging to my trousers than to me .

it 's nothing serious . i 'll just run into that building . they 'll have some sort of first aid kit .

i 'm sorry about the scroll , but sometimes you have to lose to win .

you 're like malaria . once you get it , you ca n't get rid of it .

a billion people speak chinese . do n't be too impressed with yourself . as for that scroll , i can resell it for double . in 30 minutes .

who am i ?

gin , really .

a true master . classic , yet extremely sexual , do n't you think ?

yeah . probably not .

see you .

did i ever tell you what tina wrote ? the night she died ?

take this mask . it may look like the empress , but it 's not .

you 're giving them to me ?

faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin . i got to have trust .

she reminds you of yourself . there 's nobody you admire more .

tonight your league night ?

you damn well thought wrong .

you better not be taking on a new partner .

because it pays off .

remind me why .

so patience , thibeau , patience . trust me .

how the hell i 'm supposed to know the damn difference ?

that 's it , i sure as hell ai n't no personal shopper .

because i never assume anything .

this is big enough .

you are a miracle worker .

had to get a liquid plasma screen .

yeah , the lord of the manor does n't haul his own groceries .

next time i 'll use valet parking .

um , erin ? listen . even though you 're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ... ... sometimes you 're not half-bad .

do n't use language with me --

that 's a joke , right ?

... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files . that way , at any time , we can find out a case 's status -- where it is in the office , stuff like that . we file 'em all here , alphabetically --

mr. masry , before you go off on some crusade , you might want to remember who it is you 're dealing with here . pg & e is a 28- billion dollar corporation .

250,000 is all i 'm authorized to offer .

wait a minute -- i thought we were negotiating here .

what about in terms of medical expenses ? 250,000 does n't come close to what this family 's gon na have to spend on doctors .

fax these to this number , okay ?

what ? hey -- < u > he < /u > hit < u > me < /u > .

oh my god . oh my god .

i do n't even know how much money that is .

well , then -- if you 're feeling up to it , maybe we should talk shop .

well , i was gon na head over to the browns now . i was thinking -- mandy really values your opinion ...

for what ?

sure wish i had longer to get used to the idea . you think if you got no uterus , and no breasts , you 're still technically a woman ?

the chromium . well , that 's what kicked this whole thing off .

so the whole idea of selling the house -- do n't get me wrong , i 'd be glad to move to some better place , but if they are n't gon na pay us properly , i just do n't see the point .

yeah , i 'm real glad you brought that up . i was going through your file here , and i ran into these medical records . they kinda surprised me --

this is a real nice place you got here .

you 're a lawyer ?

yes ?

hi . donna irving ?

`` i can always find someplace else to work . someplace that 'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the french riviera ... ''

i was n't gon na --

cause you got a little voice in your head saying , do the right thing . give him another chance .

say you 'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on earth if i did n't up and quit over all this .

okay , good . i think i should be the one to tell 'em , cause they trust me more than --

hey , that 's not so bad . compare it to the love canal -- that was twenty years ago , and those people still have n't seen a dime . so in legal terms , ten years is --

uh-huh .

perks ? jesus -- < u > perks < /u > ?

bullshit . you stuck me in siberia dictating to some god damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me . after all i 've done for you , that 's the thanks i get .

how dare you take that away from me .

< u > not personal < /u > ? that 's my < u > work < /u > in there , ed . my sweat , my labor , my time . if that 's not personal , i do n't know what is .

and , what , i 'm not serious ?

look , this is serious now . they 're talking serious money --

if you tell me to relax , i 'm gon na kick your fucking head off --

bullshit . it was a misunderstanding . but instead of handling it politely , instead of treating her with respect --

he 's got a reputation for doing all his --

it 's pg & e saying to the judge that we do n't have a case . their lawyers go --

what 's a demur ?

holy shit . who do they represent , god ?

you might want to think real hard about the amount , too . my kids are sitting in the god damn parking lot right now , cause i still do n't make enough to afford good child care . makes me think about looking around for a job where i 'm appreciated , for shit 's sake .

is that what you want ?

i 'm sorry , i 'm gon na have to put you on hold for just one second here -- do you mind ?

i want my fucking money --

no , ed -- what with me running for my life , i did n't have time to check those things --

someone 's following me .

d'you get his name ? course not . jesus , ed --

they 're trying to intimidate us . tell them to wait in the conference room .

if they 've sent that little shmuck baum again , i 'm gon na be real pissed off .

me too . that 's why i like it . it 's been a long time since i had a case i cared about .

really ? it makes me sick .

what do you mean ?

erin -- lem me tell you something . if i'da put three researchers on this , i would n't expect them to dig up all the information you got here . this is some damn good work .

jesus . i do n't even wan na ask what you did to make this melendez guy talk .

it did n't help , but no . the real problem 's on the bottom .

i do n't remember seeing any ponds up there .

they used the hex chrom here , in these cooling tanks , as an anti-corrosive . then they dumped it here , in these six ponds .

she lived on the plume . you never know .

another raise would n't hurt . and with all the time i 'm gon na be spending on the road , i 'll probably be needing my own cel phone , wo n't i ?

you think there 's more ?

-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it .

and you ca n't ?

so you think we got 'em scared ?

find out .

a ten percent raise and benefits . but that 's it . i 'm drawing the line .

ten . there 's a lot of other places i could work .

i want a raise . and benefits . including dental .

lem me see it , will you ?

the ones in the box of files . the box of files ? the one from your office ?

they told her something , but it ca n't have been too specific , cause i talked to her , and she sure did n't think her water was bad .

i do n't know . maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun .

oh , yeah ?

okay , enough -- now , look , erin -- this incident aside , i do n't think this is the right place for you . so what i 'm gon na do is make a few calls on your behalf . find you something else , okay ?

that 's not how we work here . you do n't just leave a message and take off .

where 's anna ?

give her a cold washcloth to suck on -- i got ta go -- there 's a clean one in that bag -- i 'll check back in a bit . sorry . my kid --

yeah ?

okay , look . if you really want to apply for a job here , you can do it the way everyone else does . send in a rsum , make an --

... matthew 's six , katie 's four , and beth 's just nine months .

yesterday .

when 'd they file the demur ?

what do you mean ?

that 's right .

and ... ?

ross -- you are an absolute angel .

i wish i knew . it 's for my boss . he 's fighting his water bill , and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places . the easiest thing would probably be if i just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself . would that be okay ?

well , believe it or not , i am on the prowl for some water records .

ross .

good luck . oh -- i would n't advertise what you 're looking for if i were you ...

well , how do i find out what kind of chromium is up in hinkley ?

harmful , like -- how ? what would you get ?

george !

i 'm gon na hate it .

how come you 're not eating ?

yeah . she is . but you know what ? that 's why i 'm helping her . so she can get some medicine to make her feel better .

you never fall short for the work people . i guess maybe you just love them more .

i 'm gon na go live with george .

well , god damn it , matthew -- randy 's mom does n't work eighteen-hour days , and randy 's dad did n't leave her , so figuring out who 's gon na take who where is a little easier over at randy 's house .

there 's no way a son of mine hates funky town . it 's impossible .

everyone 's . this is a lawsuit . we need to be able to contact the plaintiffs .

erin . you do n't even have phone numbers for some of them .

do n't talk to me like i 'm an idiot , okay ? i may not have a law degree , but i 've spent 18 months on this case , and i know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will .

no , i need my car --

you should n't be driving around , you know . you 're sick .

i do n't know . few days . thanks for helping me . i appreciate it .

they said that 'd be tomorrow . they just wan na keep an eye on me another night .

i ca n't . look -- this job -- it 's the best thing that ever happened to me . i mean it . for the first time in my life , i got people respecting me . up in hinkley , i walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what i got to say . i never had that . ever . do n't ask me to give it up . i need it .

i know . but still . six months . i think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend . cause there may be men who do n't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return , but i 'm sure as shit not one of 'em .

about what ?

no , i wan na say hi .

lock the door .

that 's ed .

no , no jokes , i got ta pee . just tell me about your day . what went on back there ?

i did n't say that .

if you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job , just say so .

how would you know ?

it does n't have to be this complicated , erin . there 's a lot of jobs out there .

what ? but you been working so hard --

i 'm gon na clean it up .

yeah , we 'll just see about that , wo n't we ?

this is n't gon na get you laid , you know .

yup . usually working on my bike . no big deal . if it does n't work out , you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady .

i 'm not a deadbeat . i work when i need to .

great . another deadbeat .

how ?

yeah . i 'm probably ruining them .

yeah , and whose fault is that ?

just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet , and we 'll get along fine .

jaguar 's a darn pretty car .

you 're clever . i 'm sure you 'll think of something .

what ?

< u > excuse me < /u > ?

what 's going on ?

what do i look like , erin ? a library ?

i mean , it 's not a problem or anything , but -- i 'm just a little unclear on what those things are . i thought maybe you 'd know .

there 's something else , too .

wow , that 's soon --

next week .

you 're moving away ? when ?

hi , sweetie . were you a good girl ? where are matt and katie ?

their parents , i 'm pretty sure .

right , i guess those are the kids --

of course ! oh , gosh , of course --

who 's baxter ?

yes , he commands you make contact with him ... .

it was ... . the emperor ... .

the boy is our last hope .

told you , i did . reckless is he ... now things are going to worse .

stopped they must be . do you hear ? on this all depends .

we 've come this far ... he is our only hope .

he 'll learn .

you do n't know that . even i can not see their fate .

i 'm cold ... so cold ...

okay , okay .

turns on lando , the newcomer , with an ominous growl .

what 's wrong with him ?

barks a blue streak .

howls and shrugs his shoulders .

barks his agreement .

not far , not far . be patient . soon you will see him . why wish you become a jedi ?

of course , yes . but now eat we must . good food , i have good food . come , come .

oh , a jedi master . different altogether . yoda you seek , yoda .

no , no ! i 'll stay and help you find your friend .

mine ! mine ! or i 'll help you not .

give me that !

ca n't get your ship out ? have you tried ? have you tried ?

i 'm looking for a great warrior .

help you i can ... yes ... yes .

then i 'll see you in hell .

we 'll have to go out on tauntauns .

what is thy bidding , my master ?

with all the meteor activity in this system , it 's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships .

not collapsing , honey . it 's closing ! this is no cave ...

what are you so grouchy about ?

i think we 're in trouble .

sit down , and shut up !

go tell your precious princess ... luke is dead unless he shows up soon .

mistress leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator , but either you have it turned off , or it is malfunctioning ... if it 's damaged , artoo , could fix it , if you like .

captain solo , sir . might i have a word with you ?

... just remember that , cause i 'll be back ...

look , sweetheart , i 'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...

well , i do trust him . lando 's an old friend . must have been an accident .

something 's wrong here . your friend lando is very charming , but i do n't trust him .

luke ! i 'm sure he 's fine . probably sitting around wondering what we 're doing right now .

who 's staring ?

it 'll be all right . trust me . and keep your eyes open . you wait here .

let er go , chewie .

a tibanna gas mine . lando won it in a sabacc match , or so he claims . lando and i go way back .

well , sometimes ... ah-hah , i knew it ! lando calrissian .

you keep logs ? my , how organized .

that depends . where are we ?

the fleet is finally breaking up . i 'm hoping they 'll follow standard imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed .

you 're going to attack them ? ! ! !

no lightspeed ?

strap yourself in , sweetheart , we 're taking off !

where ?

you could be a touch warmer , though . admit it , against your better judgment you think i 'm all right .

fine with me . but i 'm afraid you 'll have to let go .

there , there . chewie get a reading on that . looks pretty good .

we 've got to get out of this shower .

but we 're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer .

i take it back .

probably an asteroid field ... .

i know , i know , i see them ... leia see what ?

why you low-down , stuck-up , half- witted , scruffy-looking nerf-herder .

come on , your highness , are you telling me you have n't been thinking about that kiss ?

an imperial probe droid .

... . i 'm afraid there 's not much left .

no kidding . if this snowball 's got nasty natives , they could be anywhere .

now all we 've got to worry about is what attacked him .

and what are they , pray tell ?

that makes a good story . but i think you just ca n't bear to let me out of your sight .

thanks to you .

hi kid , you look strong enough to wrestle a gundark .

all this just to get the kid ? what 's so important about him ?

this ought to be good .

shut up a minute and listen . i 'm doing what i can to make this easier for you .

i 'm sorry too .

not as well as i 'd like . we 're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient . i 've had supply problems of every kind and ... what 's so funny ?

repairs ...

i always said you were a gentleman .

why you slimy , double-crossing no-good swindler ... am i glad to see you .

i 'm altering the bargain . pray i do n't alter it any further .

i 'll take what 's mine now .

good . it would be most unfortunate if i had to leave a permanent garrison here .

that sounds familiar .

no argument , just do it . that 's a command !

this is no time to be choosy , honey . what do you say we debate this later ? there 's still a chance i can get you out of here .

we have no use for your kind .

... we 're the bait .

lord vader has set a trap for him and ...

... . we are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the empire .

thanks .

i must say , your beauty is unpar- alleled . truly you belong here with us among the clouds .

have they analyzed the one that was killed ?

closer ? !

if i might remind you , sir , the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...

you do n't have to do this to impress me .

this hyperdrive had better work .

he 'll survive .

lando , is he alright ? ... lando ? are you there ? how 's luke ?

snow creatures ... they 're here ? !

i have this ... feeling . i 'm not sure , really ...

i 'm fine . really . leia ... when i was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well , it made me think about things .

and sacrifice han and leia ?

they 're my friends .

only what you take with you .

what 's in there ?

lord vader ... is the dark side stronger ?

i ca n't . it 's too big .

it would be in seven pieces , were you a jedi .

you will be , my young one . heh . you will be .

why not me ?

no ! ... . never ... .

time will tell .

you 'll find i 'm full of surprises .

did you call the zoo ?

my name is lewis -- lewis dixon .

and we can watch ...

they look pretty docile .

no -- clothes . stevie , they changed into them .

i should . i 've been doing it half my life to humans .

but he is n't us . he 's your own kind .

utopia became depressed after her mother 's suicide , began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator . she 'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time . somebody else was in there with her .

yes ...

who 's that ?

you 're stalling , eddie . talk , you little gringo !

where 's plissken ?

where ?

sure , cuervo , but look here . i 've done it all , man . i killed plissken , i got your girl back , i got it all . just for you , cuervo . just for you .

you said i could be vice-president , cuervo . your right-hand man .

where is he ?

my name is hershe hernandez , do you understand , cowboy ?

wait a minute . all right . hold on .

can you land ?

she 's overloaded ! we 're too heavy .

see you in hell , snake .

you want to stay here , while cuervo jones rules the world ?

not anymore .

plissken - this is malloy . do you have the prototype ?

it 's history . i got ta go .

lock fuel rods .

good .

a medical team will be standing by .

call me snake .

that 's the deal .

relax , war hero . we took you for a ride , and you came through . not bad for a dirtbag like you .

does he know how to activate it ?

listen up . i need directions . downtown . somebody named hershe .

i could 've helped you . we coulda made a deal with cuervo . if you 'd listen ...

i said pull over .

too many people know where you 're going , snake . that 's not good . delgado and his men were back there waiting for you .

location .

where are they ?

man , i 'd love to have your autograph , snake .

where 'd they go ?

hershe . she lives downtown with mojo dellasandro in the big boat . down that way .

run , snake ... they 're coming .

find cuervo jones .

the surgeon general of beverly hills .

no screamin ' shit .

they live here , used to be like us . but after too many silicon implants , their muscles turned to jelly . the only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again . snake , nobody who comes into beverly hills gets out alive .

hi , snake . it 's so great to meet you . my name 's taslima . i 'm a fan of yours .

give me the prototype .

get ready , shitheads . we 're comin ' in .

utopia is lost to me . my daughter is gone .

hershe , you were in cleveland ?

-- by itself it is only a piece of steel . its power comes from he who wields it . for now there is no one . do as i have ordered !

he heard lady guenevere 's request and he said nothing . that is all .

is he coming ?

then make me your champion and i will always fight in your place .

you are still the best knight in christiandom . you gained a hundred advantages over me . it is i who must love you , for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson .

it is you , sir , who knows not the virtue of humility , as a true king must .

i sought only not to harm you , sir .

i will not . you must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms , under the eyes of god .

good day to you , sir .

ready my knights for battle ; they will ride with their king once more . i have lived through others far too long ! lancelot carried my honor and guenevere my guilt . my knights have fought my causes . mordred carries my sins . now , at last , i will rule .

is this a dream ? tell me , merlin !

it is like a tree . the roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men . like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree . and the stars whisper back to men the future course of events . but the earth is being torn apart , its metals stolen , and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge . in fact , i nearly did n't make it in one piece .

what is this place , merlin ?

i can not . i must not . here i must stay .

you betray the boy who drew the sword , the boy who saw the dragon ... the dragon who moves close by , coiling and uncoiling , restless , looking down , waiting for the king to be a king ...

with all your powers , you are content to be ridiculed , laughed at ...

a king should be afraid , always . the enemy is everywhere . waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle , on the deer paths of his forest , or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest , in here .

what is it my child ?

merlin , tell me . now that guenevere is returned to me ...

guenevere . and a beloved friend who will betray you .

who will it be ? put your mind to it , then .

... of course ...

then as knight to knight i can offer you mercy .

the book without pages . open before you , all around us . you can see it in bits and pieces , for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance , why , it would burn him to cinders .

thank you .

'help me , help me . ' help me get up .

whose son am i ?

the very spear that pierced the side of christ as he died on the cross .

i recognize you only as my son , no more .

he is the mightiest and fairest of knights .

well hurry then , and get it .

if i am your judge , i can not be your champion . when i act as your king , i can not be your husband .

i grant you your wish if you grant lady guenevere hers .

-- and damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued ?

-- i 'm pretty good at stitchery . i 've sewn my father 's wounds more than once .

it did n't hurt too much , did it ?

i have waited long for you . once you almost saw , but fear blinded you . why am i served from the chalice ?

the king without his sword , the land without a king ...

-- nothing !

there are things about love --

there is one .

you are truly magnificent !

people make you laugh ?

i showed you all my conjuring tricks ...

shh ... yes , yes . sit with me , please ... morgana .

it 's clear you are , and it irks me .

it is .

maybe not even that , uther . i thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword . but it 'll take another , a greater king ...

now you must pay me .

merlin ! out of the sick sleep at last .

-- what issues from your lust will be mine . swear it again .

dumb riddles , merlin . i am your king .

one land , one king ! that is my peace !

well why are they tearing the building down ?

well what 's wrong ?

do n't you think he 's too old , though ? how 's his health ?

no , he 's working on another book .

what 's he doing there ? teaching ?

merrin ? i had notion he was over in iraq . i think i read he was working on a dig around nineveh .

you 'd want to do the exorcism yourself ?

it 's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit . it 's pretty much discarded these days , except by the catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment . it has worked , in fact , although not for the reason they think , of course . it was purely the force of suggestion . the victim 's belief in possession helped cause it ; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear .

and i do n't care what you call it ! i 'm not putting her away !

it's-

i 'm gon na miss you .

this was under regan 's pillow . did you put it there ?

what did n't he tell you ?

what the hell do you mean going out and leaving regan by her self ! what are you kidding her window 's wide open ...

oh circuit my ass , he does n't give a shit !

maybe the circuit is busy ?

and you got an invitation .

i lied . it 's for me . the spelling is on the back , kinderman . you know that film you made called angel ? isaw that six times .

look , he would n't have any reason to be up there in the first place .

it 's serious ?

no , she was heavily sedated .

a man to see you .

no rats . thanks a lot that 's terrific .

oh karl , jesus christ karl , do n't do that .

there is nothing .

no . no rats .

good morning mrs. macneil .

no . i 'm building a new house , the old one 's been sold . i was going to take regan to europe for a while , after she finished school here . why d'you ask ?

well of course i 'm sure . i 'd tell you . christ , i do n't even smoke grass .

hey do me a favour will ya ' . tell me something good .

well , it 's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain . in the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe , up here in the lateral part of the brain . it 's rare , but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion .

hey , come on , i 'm grown-up . what 'd she say ? i mean specifically , doctor .

well , i 'd say her vocabulary 's rather extensive .

you 're kidding ! like what ?

lies ?

what is it ? a tranquilizer ?

a disorder of the nerves . at least we think it is . we do n't know yet exactly how it works , but it 's often seen in earl adolescence . she shows all the symptoms : the hyperactivity ; the temper ; her performance in math .

yes . he 's already here .

she killed burke dennings . she pushed him out of the window .

did you know my mother died recently ?

did regan know a priest was coming over ?

you show me regan 's double : same face , same voice , same everything . i 'd know it was n't regan . i 'd know in my gut and i 'm telling you that that thing upstairs is n't my daughter ! and i want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there 's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind ! you tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism would n't do any good ! you tell me that !

what else ?

oh , will you help her ! just help her !

you could do it yourself ...

that 's all the more reason to forget about exorcism .

i beg your pardon ?

did n't tell you of what she did ?

pretty close ?

oh , i 'm very sorry father . hi .

hi father .

honey this is father dyer .

make it stop , it really hurts ! mother ! make it ...

so something please doctor , help her !

mother please ! oh please mother make it stop ! it 's burning , it 's burning please mother !

honey it 's to help you .

why does god let us get tired ?

cause burke and i are just friends . okay , really .

what ?

your not gon na marry him are you ?

well you know it 's okay .

you can bring mr. dennings if you like .

i love you rags . we 'll have a good day yeah ?

and also with you .

save me o ' god by thy name , by thy might defend my cause , proud men have risen up against me , men of violence seek my life , but god is my helper , the lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me , glory be to the father , the son and the holy spirit .

there 's only one .

we may ask what is relevant , but anything beyond that is dangerous . he is a liar , the demon is a liar . he will lie to confuse us . but he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us . the attack is psychological , damien . and powerful . so do n't listen , remember that , do not listen .

why ?

i would like you to go quickly over to the resdence damien , and gather up a cassock for myself , two surplices , a purple stole , and some holy water , and your copy of the roman ritual . the large one . i believe we should begin .

no .

one last time : can you think of some priest who fits the bill ?

yeah , i hate to go alone . you know , i like to talk film ; discuss the critique . d'you wan na see a film with me ? i got passes to the crest . it 's othello .

very much .

not to bother you with trivia , but a psychiatrist in sunny california was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient .

no i probably would n't .

ah , doctor 's ethics . if you knew you would n't tell , huh ?

look , father this is hard for you- please . but for priests on the campus here , you 're the psychiatrist ; you 'd know who was sick at the time , who was n't . i mean this kind of sickness . you 'd know that .

sick priest , is that it ?

i know . i read it . these desecration 's in the churchyou think they have anything to do with witchcraft ?

shove it up your ass you faggot !

almighty lord , word of god the father jesus christ , god and lord of all creation , who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions . grant me , your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins ...

o'lord hear my prey .

stick your cock up her ass ! you mother fucking , worthless cocksucker !

are you tired ?

are you a relative ?

yes

do you have an appointment ?

yes ?

i 'm afraid .

why not ?

if i ask him to tell me , will you let him answer ?

sometimes .

are you comfortable regan ?

give me the keys .

you 're not going to drive !

give me the keys !

give me the keys .

it was n't half full out there tonight , frankie . i got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball . i got ta move the liquor . to move the liquor , i got ta fill the tables . it 's a matter of economics . me , i love you . i love both you guys , you know that . you 're class . but people today . they do n't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls .

so maybe it 's time we took a vacation from each other .

twelve years .

it 's all there . both nights .

just the same .

oh . no . strictly dryland .

well , look at this .

the sooner we do this the better , mr. baker .

oh no !

i thought these were lost . where did you find ...

i told halloran we did n't do vocals , but he said :

uh , we already boxed some things . i figured you 'd want to go through dad 's stuff . it 's in there . if you want to get started .

i did n't hear you come in .

that 's right . i was n't there . i do n't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy .

stay off it .

dignity ? who the hell are you to talk about dignity ?

what-are you ? a fucking moron ? it 's three o'clock in the morning , frank . who 's watching ? your wife ? maybe you can get us a gig playing little frank 's birthday party . what do you think ?

we 're playing for a goddamn gymnasium !

what disease ?

twenty-eight years .

you want to know how much i got tied up in deposits with willie ? we 're in for three weeks solid , jack .

be reasonable , jack .

that takes care of this week . the tenth we got the sheraton , the sixteenth we 're at the capri .

it was just a can of beer , frank .

yeah .

i told you . it 's a useless talent .

they were simple songs .

drove me crazy when we were kids . the way you never looked at the music . miss simpson would just play it and ...

right . it 's incredible how you do that . remember things .

what 're you doing down here ?

he had to come quickly . it was a big leak .

what 're you trying to do ? wake up the whole goddamn hotel ?

you have n't seen susie , have you ?

time flies , huh ?

two hours ago !

yes , really . i do n't want you to be unhappy , jack . if you say it 's out of tune , it 's out of tune .

how dare you say you love me .

what 's the matter with you ? so the piano 's a little out of tune . so what ?

no , that 's your problem , frank . you get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old .

awe inspiring .

i told everyone seven-fifteen . did n't i ? seven-fifteen .

you 're getting cold feet about this .

jack .

it was a somewhat extraordinary day .

two pianos is n't enough anymore , jack .

i thought maybe twenty percent . look , with the additional bookings we 'll come out ahead . the big hotels , they want a pretty girl with a big voice . we have to stay competitive , jack .

talk .

yeah , and what put him up there ?

a gust of wind killed him .

they do n't . they 're always asking about you .

i hate your kids , frank .

you mind telling me what that was about in there ? was that planned ? or were you just bored and decided to get creative ?

count the fucking money , frank .

no , no . you boys are tired .

well , that 's fine --

moran . monica . the whole thing . it 's my stage name . my real name 's blanche .

you 're an hour and a half late .

how should i take it ?

this is show business ?

what about me ?

i just saw a man walk out of your room !

some discussion .

in case you 've forgotten , we 're being paid to be here . so it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency .

you want to tell me what the hell 's going on ?

jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle .

i do n't believe it . you 're a romantic , frank .

no . we got a picture , though . one of the waitresses had a camera . god , we were just kids . that was something , was n't it ?

as charlie steinway is my witness .

yeah .

of course it smells like fish . we 're on the ocean . what 'd you expect , chanel number five ?

my wife wears a seven . you do n't look like a seven to me .

time for what ?

that ! you ca n't wear that !

and how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster ?

christ , look at her . you 'd think if she was gon na wear her street clothes she 'd have enough sense to come in the back . good evening , miss diamond . you 're late .

we 're a team . we work together .

okay . i think that 's all we need to know .

uh , well ...

he leads , i follow .

it went well tonight .

i 'm tired . really . i should get home .

well , now , where 's everyone run off to ? frank ?

funny how life repeats itself , huh ? over and over . like a song .

i did n't want to wake you .

sneak out in the morning . before the guy could wake up and ruin it . never figured i 'd be on the other end of it , though .

vegetables .

yeah .

we outgrew each other .

so ... ?

saw the sign outside . got your own sign , huh ?

yeah , maybe ... no . god , i hate these cigarettes !

coffee ?

frank was n't 'there .

frank said -- -

by the time he gets to the corner newstand , he 's got her meeting some rich guy on the train , the rich guy 's asked her to marry him , and he 's reading about it in the morning edition .

you sending me home ?

no kidding ?

who 's nina ?

nina ?

because i saw the other people ! and they knew you were good ! you were good , goddamnit !

i 'm not upset .

you 're upset .

nothing .

how do you do it ? every night ?

it 's a shitty song .

just dinner and dance , right ?

in and out .

so why 's he do it ?

every year .

forget it .

you want me to walk you ?

nice place . fulla velvet . even the bedspreads . damn ! two-fifty a pack and i go through 'em like toothpicks . twelve-and-a-half cents a piece , you believe that ?

yeah , well , a11 i know is mother nature must be one crazy dame . shit .

because blackie carson books the park and whenever we 've needed a gig he 's come through .

the park ? it 's only two nights . why throw away a night ?

not for money . with my mother .

he 's got blood in his eye .

it ai n't always a blessing . my brother here ?

no shit . it 's the goddamn water . kill an ox . i buy bottled for my danny . you ca n't trust the taps .

there were more flowers last year . mr. rinaldi down at the drugstore says it 's going to snow by new year 's . says he can feel it in his elbows . i hope it snows . i want to make a snowman . you ever make a snowman , jack ?

okay . how 'd yours go ?

how 'd the show go ?

sounds big . what 's he do ?

they do n't give two fucks about your health . the clinic 's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment . look at o'neill --

not unless you 're sent to the `` clinic . ''

do n't they ever let us take these boots off ?

do i look wasted -- asshole ?

waxy wright . did n't jon archer bust you for poisoning five members of the canadian parliament ?

... thanks .

yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge .

how old is he ?

i 'm not the same person you remember .

yeah -- me .

or reactivated the first one .

thanks , pollux .

after that . you promised you 'd always take care of me .

you porked his wife the day he was arrested . how could you forget that ?

you shoot hoops like a chick , you smoke like a wuss , and -- i do n't know -- you 're different .

i started wondering -- if you could n't switch back -- would it make a difference ?

how is he ?

eve ...

jon , if i 'm not there , he will be tipped off . i 'll get rid of jamie -- but you and i are in this together .

you ca n't go . you ca n't be anywhere near that place .

what do you mean ?

what more proof do you need ?

i took it from my fake husband .

never mind that ! just take jamie and get out of that house . do n't tell anyone where you 're going -- especially not him -- just go .

what are you saying ? oh , god -- you 're going on assignment again ...

five years ... i still ca n't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left , matty would still be alive .

how come ?

actually -- in this dream -- i was your mother .

must 've been after we got engaged .

... i was dreaming ...

the left , i think . those surgeons in witness protection can fix things nobody 's even broken yet .

which ear was it ?

i just asked you about making love to your wife , and you started talking about your job .

one of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city .

you missed the last three , including her birthday . your wife 's gripe sheet .

jamie ...

what 're you gon na do with me gone ? you 'll drive your wife and kid nuts ! i bet your daughter is just about ripe by now . what 's her name , janie ?

you 're under arrest . incredibly , you still have the right to remain silent --

jon , i 'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun .

you 'll what ?

just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial . so take a hike .

trust me , he 's already here . get going !

kim ?

well , i saw you -- kim .

it was confirmed by your personal security code . nobody knows that code but you !

escaped ? from erewhon ? i want everyone on this -- our entire force and the sfpd .

there 's fun , bro . then there 's fun .

i 'm just having some fun .

are you trying to give us away ? for somebody with such a big brain , you think awfully small .

no -- the best part is , since it 's a government job -- they ca n't fire you ! but how can you be sure you 'll get the appointment ?

you better get used to it . that bitch lazarro is getting kicked upstairs . guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her ?

you 'd have to start immediately .

i had doubts too . i always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain . but something happened ...

what 's that ?

just following your example .

normally , i would . but today ...

back then -- who was n't ?

what are you doing ?

i 'll have a talk with her . by the way , you never said anything about last night ...

okay , if you insist . but -- you drive .

the world can wait , jon . you 're going .

jon , it 's the tenth . i know how difficult it is for you , but we still have to go .

you 're wearing your suit --

i 'm replacing lazarro . nice , safe desk job -- just like you wanted .

you always say that -- then you leave .

i 'm not going anywhere .

gone ?

you would n't even sip champagne at our wedding . we were underage -- you would n't break the law . remember what my brother called you ?

i think -- you 're trying to get me drunk .

why do i feel like i 'm on a blind date ?

the hospital ? oh , that 's right -- you 're a doctor . ha-ha .

the hospital .

what do you know about it ?

adelle ?

no ? ! you almost married this woman . are n't you even curious what she wants ?

i took the road less traveled , adelle .

she did n't want me to go to london . we 're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay .

almost married . and almost a junior broker at e.f. hutton ...

excuse me ?

oh , im hearing you , alan . thats not the problem . the problem is that what you think is yours , is really mine . and i dont care how low on the totem pole i start , i will get it back ... so do yourself a favor and dont get too attached to that view because sometime soon , maybe very soon , you and your french country antiques , your chintz sofa , and your little play pen are gon na be moving out of that office .

... thats our war room . we did seven major deals last year , three of them hostile .

take you , for instance ...

its okay , alan . i get it . im in your shoes , im thinking exactly the same thing ... but heres the thing . business is business . wall street , main street , its all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning , trying to figure out how the hell theyre gon na send their kids to college . its just people ...

uh ... we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service .

thats right . and auto supply ...

i do n't want you to be sorry , alan , i want you to be excited . i want my gift to be the first one you open this year . you know why ?

is it morning yet ?

right . thats a major oversight ... so if im kate ... i cant really afford the finer things , my husbands career is a crushing disappointment to me , im trapped in suburbia ...

thats good but ... you did forget the anniversary .

maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall . i could get her a pair of earrings or something .

dont you think thats a little gimmicky ?

like what ?

not bad ... i shoulda warned you . dad always does something really special for their anniversary .

thats where you work .

big eds .

check ...

sure .

yeah ... i guess i just wanted you to know , we couldve been really good friends ...

i never won anything in bowling .

tell me you recognize me , arnie . please ...

cmon , evelyn thompsons got no class . she doesnt marry dr. steve , the womans living in a trailer .

pretty much .

she said that ?

she is relentless .

hey jack , youre all flush . i guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you .

kates my wife ...

its not kate , is it ?

trouble at work ?

give me my goddamn life back !

no ? cmon , jack ... ive got everything i need , i dont have regrets , thats just not for me ... sound familiar ?

look , i dont know what youre getting so worked up about , you did this ... you brought this on yourself .

what ? !

you still think this is about me , do n't you ?

wow . it must be great being you . you got it all .

okay , jack . nice doing business with you ... cash is about to take off ...

a lucky streak , huh ?

there 's no way i was gon na die in that deli ... let 's just say i 've been on a lucky streak lately .

like i said , it 's a business deal ...

no .

you first generation , xenophobic , money-theistic , hot pastrami sandwich making ...

you leave now . take ticket somewhere else . next customer in line ... !

ticket bad . you draw in lines with pencil .

... 06 ... 14 ... 18 ... 48 ... right there . four numbers ... that 's two hundred and thirty eight dollar ... merry christmas and shit ...

okay , youre right , weve been dancing around this for years ...

is there something going on between us ?

need a nurse ?

something like that .

i thought i saw you notice it at the kids recital .

look , i dont know whats going on here but i am senior vice president of this company .

you want me to handle him ? i think im ready ...

here we are , mag wheels ... hey jack , are you sure youre okay ?

what are you talking about ? its me , jack campbell . penthouse c. i put you into commercial paper !

just until the deutsche mark turns ...

merry christmas , mr. campbell .

we have two kids , annie and josh ...

dont worry about it , jack ...

i 'm sorry ...

i need you to remember me , kate . how i am right now , right this very moment . i need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you , no matter what happens .

but ive done some good things too , havent i ?

a perk for what ?

pretty incredible , isnt it ?

i could stay here forever ...

thats all i wanted to hear ...

good things ...

god , sometimes i think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a cd player ...

i guess ... some of them are probably faking .

but you always seem so certain .

worse , you mean ...

how do you even know about this place ?

heres the thing . i really hadnt planned on giving you your ... uh ... anniversary gift until tonight . you know , anniversarys good all day ...

maybe i should wait ...

jack .

then say it ... just say it to me ... !

cmon , you know what i like to hear ...

you want the cake ! ?

thats my piece . i was saving it because i got nauseated from that store bought chicken .

the trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either ... you were great . surviving the heart attack was one thing ...

well ... annie for one .

its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you , jack .

do you have any idea what my life is like ?

those shoes were twenty five dollars . cmon , take it off . well go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like .

this is good stuff , jack , keep it coming ...

shouldnt we grab some dinner first ? maybe a bottle of wine ... ?

wait a second . you want me , dont you ?

jack . i said the kids are asleep ...

hello !

youre having a bad day , ill go with you ... actually , theres no way in hell youre gettin me back out there ...

but its twenty degrees outside ...

why not ?

what kind of man does that ! ?

are you okay ?

no , youre right . what are we doing ?

thank you , betty . i know if i can just sleep this off , ill be fine ...

no ...

okay ... you smoke hoyo de monterreys . youre a scotch man , single malt , not because its trendy but because youve been doing it for forty years , and you stay with what works . you have two great loves in your life , your horses and this company . you wept openly the day the dow hit ten thousand ...

youre a little tougher , peter .

... were really more of a boutique operation , as you can see ...

peter lassiter ...

that 'll happen when you 're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin ...

peter . i do n't see you rushing home to trim the tree .

im sorry , no ...

no ... im not ...

can i help you ?

christmas ? it cant be christmas ...

thats totally see through ...

if it 's something you feel strongly about .

jersey ? you know what the traffic 's gon na be like ?

thanks . you 're not bad yourself ...

ill go for a cup of coffee !

you didnt seem to mind offering to help me on christmas day when you were unwrapping that prada bag i gave you .

do you want me to look for the box or call the airline ?

you do n't know what it 's like out there . walking around like some kind of circus freak . people staring , whispering --

`` sensual blind chick seeks three-ton , rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship . ''

we 're going to have to work on your touch .

those yours too ?

no , i mean ... i 'm a little ... dusty ...

relax , it 's casual .

got it , teach .

glad `` nothing '' could take you away from your work .

yeah . i can tell . victor was right .

ben --

it 's about to be a broken face .

o-kay . we 'll skip that question .

okay . i 've uh , got some questions , from sue . that she thought might be better coming from me ... can you , you know , go to the bathroom ... like normal ...

what the -- !

reed . even < u > you < /u > ca n't compute every little thing .

three days . i was worried about you . how are you feeling ?

< u > should < /u > ?

this is your dream , reed . you should be the one up there .

when have i asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do ?

youthful high spirits .

external srbs , orbital system engines . its just like the shuttles you flew in --

ben , think about all the people we can help if this works --

what about his first born ?

the machine works . and vic 's gone mister hyde on us --

what 's wrong with me ?

they 're fine . everybody < i > else < /i > ... is fine .

back on earth . victor 's medical facility ... we 're in quarantine .

where ... where am i ?

yeah , well , his eyes say different .

i already got it . everything i want .

baby , you 're scaring me .

deb ... it 's me . i need you to step out front .

i 'll be watching over you .

< u > where is reed < /u > ?

it 's not him . it 's < u > them < /u > . i ca n't live like this .

you look like an eighties rock band .

we need to give you a physical , so we know what got zapped .

at this rate , the infection should be complete in two , maybe three weeks --

and they 're changing into ...

johnny . supernova .

this place is deluxe . you got cable ?

no : you 're < u > on fire < /u > !

stay right . left is trouble .

you 're hot !

what are you doing --

you 're gon na pay for that , pebbles . what ? !

you 're really cramping my style here .

grow up , johnny . you want to run around < u > on fire < /u > for the rest of your life ?

i think that thing is ben .

okay , `` mom . ''

stop it .

johnny .

front page ?

yes sir . you 've got the mayor at eight , then a nine-thirty interview with the journal --

you know , maybe you should get some rest --

reed 's disaster . you know , i half- think he did this to me on purpose .

stable . we 're looking at low twenties . it 's a good number , considering the fallout from --

reed 's < u > always < /u > right . good thing he does n't always know what he 's got ...

what i < u > should < /u > have done a long time ago . applications and patents , reed . this all belongs to me .

what are you doing here ?

< u > i < /u > ruined ? with all due respect , i told you to abort --

did n't go as < u > planned < /u > ? it was a < u > catastrophe < /u > . you ruined the lives of four people --

just a little banged up . a couple scrapes . why ?

get a grip . reed . we did n't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch . just close the shields ...

we 've got < u > minutes < /u > until it hits , not hours ... victor , that storm 's < u > deadly < /u > -- the radiation 's lethal . we need to abort .

hilarious .

funny how things turn out , is n't it ?

a < u > gasket < /u > ? reed , we 're at a party .

i 'm sure i can come up with something .

the power ... i need ... more power ... to control ... the storm --

i did . i did , reed ... but i wanted < u > you < /u > to be that man .

i gave him twenty .

you < u > were < /u > ?

curing countless diseases , not just ours .

what are you doing ?

there were a lot of variables to consider --

are you kidding ?

i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry , i did n't mean to do that ... you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --

let 's not jump to conclusions , we need a < i > massive amount of evidence < /i > before making that leap .

for science .

you always had a way with words . i should be getting back .

great minds think alike .

victor , we < u > ca n't do anything < /u > until the research is ready .

please do n't make this personal --

then why is reed dragging his feet ? maybe he < u > likes < /u > having his prize specimen under glass ... it 's ironic , is n't it ? you 're finally the perfect woman for him ... because you 're his < u > science project < /u > .

susan . what are you doing ?

victor , wait , slow down a second . i want you to know i appreciate everything you 've done for me , but i just do n't --

it is . there 's something we need to talk about . something i need to ask you ...

victor , your scar --

what 's going on ?

it 's been a good two years , victor ... the company 's accomplished so much .

i think you both know my director of genetic research , susan storm .

i 'm just saying , i know what it 's like to lose something you love . to see it slip away , and know it 's never coming back .

well , how about hypnosis ? that ca n't hurt him !

in his comatose state ... and everything slowed down ... no more than sixty seconds .

the less time , the better .

medical 's ready .

where do we stand ?

why do n't you go on . we 'll meet you at the clearance desk in a few minutes .

he 's blanked out on that one particular point .

ca n't remember ? ... what do you mean ?

just one , general ...

it 's only for an hour --

but i do n't want to be miniaturized -- !

as part of the crew .

trip ? where to ?

if the other side ever gets hold of a thing like that ...

we can shrink an army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap . that 's why we call it < combined miniature deterrent forces > .

general , i 've heard some wild ones . but this takes it .

< combined miniature deterrent forces > .

we have no choice . duval 's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country , and he 's right here , at hand .

cora peterson , his technical assistant . you 'll join duval and the others --

i ca n't even put a band-aid on my finger .

< me > ?

and no matter what happens , you 're to take orders < only > from dr. michaels , understand ?

[ line of dialogue cut off ]

no danger of attack , as long as you do n't trigger them off by any injury to the system .

that 's beside the point now . i do n't see the sense of going on .

i ca n't imagine how it possibly could have come loose . i distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --

listen ... the heart .

i do n't know yet , doctor . and i wo n't know until i test it .

no danger of an embolism . at our reduced scale , they 're much too minute to prove fatal to benes .

but big enough for us ...

yes , a fistula too small to show up on the x-rays .

oh , no . plenty of cause . he wo n't follow the herd , or change his convictions -- even when they 're not popular . and he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days , there 's nothing more suspicious than that .

under a cloud without cause , i take it .

that 's why you 're really here . i knew it from the start .

such as ?

open it ! open it before they get here !

look at that ... they 're changing color ...

a long time , with one man .

i 've been with him since i got out of school . he brought me into the cmdf , over five years ago .

not in the hands of a great surgeon like dr. duval . the beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter .

you may learn to like it .

dr. duval , you are not going through with this ! i absolutely forbid it ! i 'm responsible for the lives of everyone here ! i will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship !

what 's that ?

take a close look at your soul , and your infinity , and your god out there --

i know only too well what 's in the balance , doctor . and it 's not my ego , damned or otherwise .

as usual , you want everything your way . except this time there 's more than your damned ego at stake .

if it wo n't work , it 's beyond my power to fix it . but if it does , there 's no telling how long it will hold up . it 's a jury rig , at best , and we 'll need every second of use we can get out of it . that 's why i do n't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests .

yes ...

that puts us right here ... which means we can head straight for the sub arachnoid cavity .

but that is n't possible .

i do n't agree . i think we ought to stop and take a sample .

doctor , what 's wrong ?

what about dr. michaels ?

you said there was a quick way out !

how does it look , doctor ?

`` proclaiming in incandescent glory the myriad mind of man ... ''

is n't there another route ? so we can by-pass all this ?

why not ? because of his gibberish about god and the soul ? camouflage -- that 's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you ! and to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill benes ! and you made it possible !

i 'm in charge of this mission ! you were instructed to take orders from me , not give them !

once time 's up , de-miniaturization begins . in a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the system . then white corpuscles will swarm to destroy it , as they would any invader .

no , we should reach the base of the brain shortly . and from there , it 's not far to the site of the injury .

let 's hope they realize the danger . captain , i 'll give you a new compass heading .

i saw the laser just before we started . it was fastened down securely . you do n't suppose what happened was an 'accident ? ' any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub ?

cough ? if he can kick up a storm by just < breathing > --

but that 'll knock out our communications ! we 'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside .

just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes .

if those corpuscles can take on air , no reason why we ca n't . all we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about , and when benes inhales , there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank . how 's that sound to you , skipper ?

there it is !

if we ca n't go back , is there an alternate route ?

a forced joining of an artery and vein . must 've happened when benes was hurt .

miss peterson , his technical assistant .

go ahead .

oh -- sure , sure ! never better !

uh -- what ?

who , me ? oh , no ! do n't bother about me ! we 're not hurt ! is n't that right , skipper ?

what happened ?

any reserve air ?

nothing you could see with the naked eye . but there 's a microscopic radio-active particle inside .

sort of .

yes , there is .

it 's a dangerous procedure . if i miss the timing , we could explode the tanks ... but i 'm willing to try it .

on the repeater .

what do you mean ?

the wall 's transparent ...

doctor -- the channel 's getting awful narrow .

then do n't drift down further .

we could never fight that current it 's physically impossible .

ophhem ma fuchem gaphe !

well , see , there 's a minimum charge of four dollars . long-term parking charges by the day .

yeah , i just came in . i decided not to park here .

unghh ... oh , geez ...

where 's my damn daughter ? no jean , no money !

i am through fucking around ! drop that fucking briefcase !

what 's this , sir ?

... so maybe the best thing would be to take care of that , right here in brainerd .

you 're required to display temporary tags , either in the plate area or taped inside the back window .

i do n't know . few munce .

yeah , well , it depends on the artist . you know , jose feliciano , ya got no complaints . waiter !

i do n't think so . it 's nice .

one of us pays the other for half .

... you c ' n'ave my truck . i 'm takin ' a shiera .

she started shrieking , you know .

no .

... look at that . twin cities . ids building , the big glass one . tallest skyscraper in the midwest . after the sears , uh , chicago ... you never been to minneapolis ?

... come on , man . okay , here 's an idea . we 'll stop outside of brainerd . i know a place there we can get laid . wuddya think ?

what 're you , nuts ? we had pancakes for breakfast . i got ta go somewhere i can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe . not more fuckin ' pancakes . come on .

what ?

or your fucking wife , jerry .

... the heck d'ya mean ?

now we had a deal here ! a deal 's a deal !

we need more -

oh , jean 's okay . but there 's three people up in brainerd who are n't so okay , i 'll tell ya that .

... who 's jean ?

well , that 's , that 's , i 'm not go inta , inta - see , i just need money . now , her dad 's real wealthy -

except that you were gon na be here at 7:30 .

... so i guess that 's it , then . here 's the keys -

yah , you do n't need that . now were you thinking of financing here ? you oughta be aware a this gmac plan they have now , it 's really super -

yah , but this trucoat -

where 'd you get him that parka ?

oh , he 's adorable .

you have children ?

oh , yah , i know that !

ya got that right .

uh-huh - in what way ?

oh sure .

and then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now . so i do n't say nothin ' and he says , 'what do ya think about that ? ' so i says , 'well , that do n't sound like too good a deal for him then . '

yah , right-o .

oh , yah ? twin cities ?

uh-huh .

first one 's a trucking company , second one 's a private residence . a shep proudfoot .

no , i got ta - hey , norm , i thought you were goin ' fishin ' up at mile lacs ?

oh , yah ?

was he funny-looking apart from that ?

well , the little guy , he was kinda funny-looking .

yah .

yah , that can happen .

a subconscious-type thing .

yah . maybe i 'm sayin ' that cause he smoked marlboros .

... what 's the big deal ? it 's an hour -

okay . well , that 's why we do n't want ya goin ' out fer hockey .

uh-huh .

i 'm talkin ' about your potential .

okay . and scotty , is he gon na be all right ?

ya know , they said no one listenin ' in , they 'll be watchin ' , ya know . maybe it 's all bull , but like you said , stan , they 're callin ' the shots .

yah .

what 's the next step here , jerry ?

we 're gon na get mom back for ya , but we got ta play ball . ya know , that 's the deal . now if lorraine calls , or sylvia , you just say that mom is in florida with pearl and marty ...

yeah , but -

no ! we ca n't let anyone know about this thing ! we got ta play ball with these guys - you ask stan grossman , he 'll tell ya the same thing !

sir ? right now ?

... i 'm sorry , sir ?

ma'am , i answered your question .

i know , but - well , how do you establish that , sir ? are the cars , uh , counted daily or what kind of -

the car 's not from our lot , ma'am .

okay , are you sure , cause , i mean , how do you know ? because , see , the crime i 'm investigating , the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates . and they called someone who works here , so it 'd be quite a coincidence if they were n't , ya know , connected .

no , i -

yah , ya know we 've got the big statue there . so you have n't had any vehicles go missing , then ?

... brainerd ?

... dad ?

yah .

well , yah , i got an idea . how 's that ciera workin ' out for ya ?

jerry lundegaard .

yah . owner was on the desk then , said these two guys had company .

i 'm not sure i agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework , there , lou .

you should n't be on your feet too much , you got weight you 're not used too . how 's the food down there ?

oh , fine .

yah , ya think ?

well , they 're all out on the wire . well , you know ...

his wife 's in the hospital , has been for a couple months . the big c .

well ... why do n't we ...

congratulations , jerry .

this is do-able .

he was killed in action .

right , right .

that would n't interest you .

you are a moron .

that 's a fucking great , man ! fucking great ! congratulations .

six months ago , bob 's testicles were removed . then hormone therapy . he developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen . that was where my head fit -- into his huge , sweating tits that hung enormous , the way we think of god 's as big .

this was a support group for men with testicular cancer . the big moosie slobbering all over me was bob .

what about this ? keep me on payroll as an outside consultant . in exchange for my salary , i 'll keep my mouth shut . i wo n't need to come to the office . i can do this job from home .

we need to talk .

i 'd like to thank the academy ...

whoever set this homemade dynamite could 've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion . the gas , it seems , was just a detonator .

yes . it left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride . do you know what that means ?

no , i was n't aware ...

you need healthy , natural sleep . chew valerian root and get some more exercise .

no , you ca n't die of insomnia .

i did , i think . but , i 'm okay ... i 'm fine ...

yes , fine . just , get on . stay away a couple of weeks , at least .

okay , if that 's what it takes , you 'll never have to see me again . here ... here ...

marla ...

you have to get out of here . leave as soon as possible . go to any rural town , away from any major city ...

i mean , the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me . i know this ... i know us has n't been such a great thing for you ...

i know that i 've been ... unwell . i know it 's been like there 's two sides to me .

marla ... i need to talk to you . it 's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out .

what ... ?

you fuck me , then snub me . you love me , you hate me . you show me your sensitive side , then you turn into a total asshole ! is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship , tyler ?

answer the question !

will you just answer me , for christsake ? !

can i come in ?

you 're afraid to say .

... a person .

have we been talking too long ? must we change the subject ?

hear what ?

well ... thanks , anyway .

uh ... nah .

okay . okay , i 'm sure .

feel anything ?

here .

good .

tragically , they 're dead . i 'm alive and i 'm in poverty . you want any ?

please .

i do n't know ...

do n't worry , i 'm leaving .

it suits you .

so you 're staying in tonight ?

this could go on for hours .

i 've been going to debtor 's anonymous . you want to see some truly fucked up people ?

it 's for men .

really ?

you have n't been going to yours .

should we ?

looks like this is goodbye .

so , we each have three -- that 's six . what about the seventh day ? i want ascending bowel cancer .

you ca n't have the whole brain !

you ca n't have both parasites . you can take blood parasites --

i 'll take the parasites .

candy-stripe a cancer ward . it 's not my problem .

... and you come home to this .

uh ... i 'm sorry . we met on the plane . we had the same briefcase . i 'm ... you know , the clever guy .

what ?

you were in here last thursday night .

is this a test , sir ?

you 're a tourist . i saw you at melanoma , tuberculosis and testicular cancer .

okay , everyone .

-- but , in here , in everyone , there 's the squint of a five-day headache . yet they forced themselves to be positive . they never said `` parasite ; '' they said `` agent . '' they always talked about getting better .

i was n't really dying , i was n't host to cancer or parasites ; i was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around .

tonight , we 're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra ...

what ?

do something for me .

not my mouth . our mouth .

if i leave , you will be right back where i found you ...

from now on , we 'll share marla . we 've been spending too much time apart ...

noooo , please ...

no , no , i do n't . i thank you , i really do . thank you , but i do n't need you anymore .

paraffin . your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin . i saw it floating in the bomb .

paraffin .

i ... ann ... .iinn.. ff ... .nnyin ...

i think this is about where we came in .

you want out ?

do n't pull the green wire . pull anything but the green wire .

what a ridiculous thing to say .

you never talked to me in front of anyone else .

he 's not here ! tyler 's not here anymore ! he 's gone away !

sometimes i control it , and you imagine yourself watching me ...

people think that you 're me , because you and i happen to share the same body .

i do n't know ! tell me !

why do people think anything ?

you 're too young . sorry .

... is over .

why do you think i blew up your condo ?

i would feel nothing about my life ? is that what you want to hear ? !

i want to know --

look ...

where did you go , psycho-boy ?

tyler ...

okay , and ... and ...

fucking sweet .

no , what you 're feeling is premature enlightenment .

i ... i think i understand . i think i get it ...

i was going to my cave to find my power animal .

tyler 's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand .

what is this place ?

you get rid of her .

shhhhhh ! i do n't know what to make of this , sir , i really do n't ...

that was three times you promised .

promise ?

if you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house , to her or anyone -- i will find out . and you 'll never see me again . promise me .

listen ... do me a favor ... sit here a minute ...

marla does n't need a lover . she needs a case worker .

i 'm fine .

abe lincoln . big reach . skinny guys fight till they 're burger .

fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails .

shatner . william shatner .

a guy came to fight club for the first time , his ass was a wad of cookie dough . after a few weeks , he was carved out of wood .

`` i get cancer , and i kill joe . ''

what ?

hum .

where 's your car ?

a generation of men raised by women . i 'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need .

same here .

if you could fight anyone ... one on one , whoever you wanted , who would you fight ?

like hell . that counted .

where do you want it ? in the face ?

me ?

you get the idea .

in reel three , right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can , there 's the flash of tyler 's contribution ...

why would anyone want this shitty job ?

what ?

a hotel ?

what list ?

delivered from martha stewart .

delivered from swedish furniture .

i guess so .

how 's that working out for you ?

thank you .

oxygen gets you high . in a catastrophic emergency , we 're taking giant , panicked breaths ...

that old saying , how you always hurt the one you love , well , it works both way .

abort the plan .

who is this ?

no !

what he wanted ? look ... look at him . look at him ! what does he want ? this is a person . this is not a cog in your machine ...

alright , christ ! fucking let me go !

he do n't own this place , i do . how much money 's he getting for this ?

we have a deal worked out with irvine .

yeah ... animals and s-s-s -- -

biology , mostly .

please , god , no ...

i have to save eugene !

this makes no sense . isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake . could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested ?

six duds in a row .

you were there ?

i was driving a white van . it must 've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and i drowned . it was ... horrible .

if you have the same power as alex , you 'll be seeing signs soon . when you see anything creepy or ominous , an in-your-face irony kinda thing ? do n't ignore it . it usually means the difference between life and death .

congratufuckinglations . that makes you last to go . but do n't worry , once the others are dead , it 'll come back for you . always does .

officer burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends .

it 's not just about me . someone i saved died last night in a freak accident . what if the others are in danger , too ?

yeah , how ?

i thought ... i thought you might be able to help me .

do n't sweat it . it 's over .

taken care of .

holy shit . he said `` only new life can defeat death . '' if she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born , a brand new soul that was never part of death 's design ...

random , sure .

what about you , kimberly ? did you anyone from flight- ?

carter .

blow me . yellow means go , kimmy .

blow me . yellow means go , kimberly .

of course not . that would be irresponsible and unprofessional .

do you want to deliver this baby ?

does she have a cell phone ? a way we can contact her ?

i 'm officer burke . i 'm looking for an isabella cruz .

i got that beat . so like , last may , i was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in pennsylvania . there was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night .

but why single me out ? what am i in the great scheme of things ? you 'd think i stepped off flight 180 or something ... fucking weird , man .

for god 's sake , leave him alone , dad .

i know . i can feel it too .

impossible . she was on the onramp .

i know how it feels to be dead .

no time . keep going . i would n't know how to explain any of this anyway .

should n't we pull over ?

um , kimberly ? this is a neighborhood . you may wan na slow it down .

he ca n't breathe damn it . i think his lung 's collapsed !

how do you know ?

whoa , nine months ?

how are we going to find her ? there must be thousands of white vans in this state .

shit , i do n't have her number . she was never interviewed . she took off right after the accident .

it sounds all well and good , but what if we 're wrong ?

it throws the entire death list out of whack . and a new list has to be rewritten from scratch . we all start over with a clean slate .

yeah , i thought he was supposed to be helpful .

new life defeats death ? follow the signs ? where the hell did you find that guy ?

i did . and right now , i do n't think she cares .

... my premonition was just like his .

billboards about accidents . kids yelling `` pile up '' for no reason . it all felt ... just wrong . just like ...

you 're not listening to me ! you have to do something !

there 's going to be a pile up . logs . bodies everywhere . i saw it happen . it happened .

what is it ? what are you ?

want me to drive ?

i guess so .

i used to have those feelings , too . but that 's when i 'd think of mom . her strength ... and courage . and i 'd pray that maybe i 'd grow up to be as brave as she was . and the bad thoughts would go away .

there were so many times i did n't think i could last another day . i ca n't even tell you some of the things i thought about .

i love you too , dad . goodnight .

i will , dad . bye , luv you .

your car 's leaking either transmission or brake fluid . i want you to have it checked asap at a gas station .

kimberly ? it 's dad .

i know this is the first time we 've been apart since . but everything 's gon na be okay .

thanks , dad . i 'll call you .

yeah ?

you 're all certifiable , you know that ? i ca n't believe i 've been listening to this crap . come on , tim , let 's go outside .

damn , it really hurts , mom .

no ! no ! do n't !

do n't do it ! do n't do it !

easy , billy , just open it .

we 're takin ' you to a cabin in the woods , it 's only a couple miles from my house . keep off the highways , they 'll be lookin ' for us .

nothing is ... anymore .

alex , on the plane ... you must have experienced ... some kind of hyper awareness . but here ... you 're suggesting tod 's death ... and maybe our own ... will happen because of ... an active presence .

i 'm not just layin ' down a bunch of math here , with this . i 'm talking about indications ... omens ... that day , that we were meant to die . that , if , we have been aware of ... would have saved everyone on the plane .

wait . i thought you meant the time of your birth . four/twenty-five , as in , month and day ... that 's a reach .

thirty-nine .

remember the gate number ?

how many died on flight 180 ? from our group ?

he said death has a design . even before he said that i had been seeing patterns .

ohmygod ! ohmygod ! ohmygod ! he 's not dead ?

doin ' somethin ' i 'm not supposed to .

like you , the sculpture does n't even know what , or why , it is . reluctant to take form . and , yet , creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction .

i 'm ... really sorry .

it is . but that did n't stop me . should n't stop you .

`` intervention ? '' what are you , god now ? !

my intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design .

all i owe is these people . to live my life to the fullest .

i wish you were on the plane !

me , too . but my dad does n't understand . when he 's better ; you and me , road trip to the city . catch the yanks .

dude , get wisdom . we 're about to board a seven hour flight . the toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets . what if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in christa or blake ? you want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes ?

man , that is one george michael notch from being gay .

`` next ? ''

no . i saw it . i saw it !

did you take any sedatives before boarding , or on the plane . sleeping pills ?

no harm . no foul .

you saying tod did kill himself ?

in death ...

cuticle lacerations .

i know who you are .

hey , man , why 'd you say that ? !

that 's what i 'm doin ' !

star wars ?

your buddy made it out last night . the place went apeshit .

put it in the guard 's barracks . man they got pissed . they beat the crap out of me , but ... it 's kind of a tradition . you oughta see 'em run around .

what 's that ?

you 're gon na love it .

forget it .

i 'm getting him out .

snoring . five , six guys . mumbling ... vietnamese . somebody talking in his sleep . a toilet flushing .

pirates ? no kidding ?

yeah . dinky-dau , that 's me . hey , co. you wan na meet jake the one- eyed snake ?

brewer . does a jet make noise ?

we 'll check it out .

no cigarettes .

you fucking crazy ? i need it to burn these things off .

there 's a compass in the handle .

home on my strobe .

you break your leg , i 'll have to shoot you .

gettin ' old , huh ?

start over .

minigun . come on . let 's move . he 's coming in on our open side .

look , co ...

i could n't get you in .

you try get across laos ? get to thailand ?

let 's go .

thanks .

they heard about escaped prisoner on radio . make deal . more than we pay .

yes . but i lose many merits in next life . very bad .

nguyen is good boy .

huntington beach , california .

where 's his father ?

how did you get started working for the spooks ?

i thought he was with you .

where did you find this clown ?

sorry , sir . ca n't do it .

alternate lz zulu sierra at 0500. it says `` may have heat . do n't be late . all our love . ''

do n't look so disappointed . it should be hairy enough ... even for you .

what 's the plan ?

memo e-7 on top will cover the details . an abandoned vietnamese army base in the north-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp . as you can see the intelligence is soft . these landsat photos show huts ... barracks . it could be anything .

i 'm not jumping blind .

not yet .

where ?

what 's the job ?

he ... took it .

... and then he , uh ... took the other one .

um ... actually , no . it looks like he shot down one of their gunships ...

he 's giving them a run for their money . says here they 've got two hueys from danang . i did n't know those dinks had hueys .

it 's not necessary .

how long before you 're fully on line ?

about 22 hours on site .

i could a couple of days ago . gon na be ... stiff .

keep it clean , rambo , or i 'll nail your hide to the shed .

what did you want ?

five . i never wanted that stuff .

you 're not .

mind if i sit down ?

the nails ! ! watch the nails ! ! ... listen , you still have to eat .

yeah !

i do n't feel like i make any impression on people ... at office parties i spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them , so the platters will always look full . i do n't start conversations because i have no idea how to end them ... i think i 'm just meant to live in the background of things .

it 's a disgusting process . you have n't missed anything .

tell me about it . i 've been dating longer than i 've been driving . i ca n't believe that .

... so ... anybody special in your life ?

it 's an awful thing , let me tell you . my aunt used to say , `` divorce is the sister-in-law of death '' .

will it hurt ?

well , i guess i 'll come back then .

you know , i think i ... ordered some just the other day .

yeah .

this will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if ... you like at a membership discount .

i 'm shocked . with a child bearing body like yours ... ... why a man would have to be out of his mind !

< u > you 're surprised < /u > ! ... but i guess i just never met the right guy . whatta gon na do ?

i mean , i 've gone out with bums , but they were gorgeous . it 's the only reason to go out with a bum .

how have you been ?

you ca n't even give me that ? ! what were you gon na do , jack ? ... just gon na organize your life ... ... walk out that door , move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else ? what were you planning to do , jack ?

no . so what time do you need ? i love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going , great ! i 'd like to be a part of it -- i think i deserve that ! so what do you need to figure out alone ! ?

... i 'd like to focus on my career - - now than i can , now that everything 's all right ... parry 's taken care of ... and ... like i said , i feel like i know a lot more now and i do n't ...

slowed things down ? where have i been ? have we been going fast ! ?

`` i 'm an incredible woman ? '' what is this , a death sentence ?

what ?

ya know , i 'm thinkin ' -- with another income coming in , i would love to get a bigger place .

thanks .

you 're kidding ! what did he say ?

you were great . thanks alot .

well ... i think you should feel very proud . you did a real nice thing for somebody else . i 'm very proud .

he just needs some clothes ?

i do n't know ... he 's a little disgusting ... although some women go for that .

i thought ... if ... if i can help him in some way ... you know ? ... get him this girl he loves ... then ... maybe ... . things 'll start changing for me ... my luck , ya know ... maybe ... forget it ... it 's a stupid idea .

well , what the hell does that mean ?

lydia is the girl parry likes ... and i thought , if i could get them together i ...

i was not with a woman last night . i was out with parry .

i wish there was some way i could ... just ... pay the fine and go home .

i tell you something , anne . i really feel like i 'm cursed .

oh , i used to be such a catholic .

you 're all right ... you sure ...

it 's not funny . it 's ... sophomoric and mindless ... and dumb .

she < u > likes < /u > me . she said for me to call !

remember . one chorus and out .

where ? maybe we can .

leave me alone ... i wan na go ...

is n't that awful ? poor brenda frazier . poor little gloria . they ruined them ! they ate them alive !

well there ... . what 's the difference ?

well , i do n't understand . what did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or ... or ... a list ?

well , congratulations lydia , because out of several thousand card holders ... in conjunction with several major credit card companies ...

... i feel so much for her ... i feel like something awful is going to happen .

maybe , when we get the grail ...

you 're out of your fucking mind ! !

come on , try it . ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella 's flappin ' in the breeze . ... everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we 're bare assed in the middle of it . come on !

i wish you all the luck in the world . when you get the grail , i 'm sure i 'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows ...

oh , please ... you 're embarrassing me .

well , no wonder . we just met , made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and i ca n't even remember the first kiss which is the best part .

and then we 'll exchange phone numbers and you 'll leave and never call and i 'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch . why am i putting myself through this ? it was very nice ... uh meeting you . good night..

tell me more . i want to know everything .

what do you do - for a living i mean ?

how do you know him ?

who ?

yeah . that 's before the big thaw .

how do you know it 's clean ?

washington .

look at my car ! piece of shit ! i just bought it brand new from a used-car lot , and the steering goes to the pot on me !

one number two , and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter , the mayo , the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee ... anything else ?

i 'm sorry , we do n't have side orders of toast . i can give you an english muffin or a coffee roll .

no . we have tomatoes .

well , you seem very professional ...

i 'm gon na give you our number , donnie , just in case ... we 're both professionals , if you did n't guess .

i did n't want to say goodbye to anyone .

you 're leaving ?

look , ca n't you see that , what i 'm talking about ?

i 'm not . he does walk funny . do n't you see that ?

why are you being so mean ?

you 're attractive , tita . if you just did a little more with yourself ...

constantly . night and day . and unless i get up before the birds , i ca n't get in any practice time for myself ...

what about carl and catherine ? is he just coaching her , or what ?

sort of .

no , i do n't . you should 've left a long time ago .

well , i really appreciate it , carl .

all right ...

yeah ... i guess so ...

oh , well , what , what 's he ...

well , herbert 's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra , so at the moment , there 's just daddy , carl and myself ... and van oost .

very nice .

no kidding .

do n't , then .

no , i 'm not ... i 'm not .

tea .

i 'll be back later ...

robert ?

yeah , i think i could .

something witty and devastating like that .

i married him when i was 17. he was a cellist , and i thought he was the most brilliant man i 'd ever met ... and i 'm sure he was , because at that age , i had n't met that many ... but he was insidious , you know . he had me convinced that i was a mediocrity , musically , as a woman , as an intellect . but in this completely imperceptible , pleasant way , so that you were n't even sure he was doing it . anyway , i just woke up one morning and i said , you know something joseph , you 're full of beans , and i left him ...

no , do n't do that ...

no , you 're very good at it . i 'm really impressed .

what ?

thank you .

that was beautiful , robert . i 'm surprised ...

you do n't call that music , though .

i gave it a second thought .

yeah , i 'll probably be free .

tomorrow , then .

after that , i plan to read some music and rest for awhile .

then after that ?

right now i 'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself .

what would i do with it ? run amok ?

that 's dangerous , you know .

yes , intentionally .

robert , let 's not be rude , okay ?

at game , carl .

that 's what i mean ...

what do you mean ? aside from my neck , i 'm in superb shape .

is she ?

suit yourself . but i 'll tell you , where we 're headed is gon na get colder ' n hell .

oh , uh huh . i had a little kittycat once , that bobby give me ...

you 've been staying in a motel all this time ?

well , you 're a romantic , catherine , as are most musicians , and what 's more , about to be married ...

and what about love ?

hold onto this .

salesmen and cops are the ones . if you 'd ever waitressed , honey , you 'd know .

in my personal thing , i do n't see that . i 'm seeing more filth . a lot of filth . what they need to do every day , no , once in a while , is a cockroach thing , where they spray the homes . and uh ... can you imagine , if their doors were painted a pretty color , and they had a pot outside , with ...

mass production is what does it .

i strongly doubt it , but i was n't really discussing media ...

do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first ? this is tiring me .

that 's exactly what i am doing , again .

if you want to call it that .

then i want you to go to whoever 's sayin ' that and tell them to stop .

is it true ?

not now , i 'm busy

oh , 'cause you got it like dat ?

good . i 'm faithful to them .

you look good .

you know . i got a lot , more than one .

you know somebody around here ?

i , umm , came to see you .

first of all , let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation . i 'm not going through formal channels here , because if alan stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties , then nobody has to know i was even --

oh , thanks .

what ?

creasy , how old are you ?

sonofabitch .

he does n't know ? how come he does n't know ?

go ahead . make my evening .

not at all , chief . but next time ... no tongue , okay ?

thanks for coming down to see us .

that a boy .

i hate the beach . would n't go there if you paid me . besides , i 'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the himalayas . you do n't think it 's the mafia , do you ?

can i call my mom ? i 'd like to tell here how much i 've always loved her .

you idiot . off the record , deep background : i 've got that beach crawling with undercover cops .

'your men ' might just be involved in all this .

i 'm about to break that beach wide open , and i do n't need some pennyante woodward and bernstein getting in the way of my men .

i 'm president of the international fletch corporation .

fletch .

your 'foolproof ' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you 're basking in rio .

put the gun down , alan . i 'll take care of them .

what the hell are you doing here ?

yeah , we check you into mt . hebron for a few days , run lots of tests , charge a bundle . you can pull your pants up now .

just relax .

is she ever . i 've got some stories ... .

oh , i do n't belong formally . i 've gone with my aunt .

no books . no elephants either . no really good elephant books .

but not right next to each other . i thought that 's what you meant .

rio . know how he gets it in the country ? some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets . very impressive operation , fletch . very impressive .

gum thought brazil .

noooo . free snort . that 's it .

oh , i 'll help , fletch . i 'm a slave to that sonofabitch . he busted me , third offense , gave me a choice : work for him or do fifteen long . all i get out of this is free snort .

thought so . what for ?

my pleasure .

sorry . i find a little humor really brightens things up around here , dont you ?

for sure ?

like when ?

no idea at all ?

that 's it .

right . fine .

cash . i 'm impressed .

hey , shut up , okay ? i just hate this .

whoops .

how similar in build you and i are . then i figured it . you bump me off , throw me in the car , and burn me up .

he does n't read my stuff well . 'sally ann and alan were married four years ago and never divorced , making stanwyk a bigamist even in utah . stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash , the result of gail stanwyk 's conversion of boyd aviation stock . mrs. stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in utah , but it was n't ; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor james swarthout of provo . ' that was stupid , alan .

pretty hefty . keep reading .

why do n't you check it out for yourself , mr. nugent ?

mrs. stanwyk , may i borrow this picture . i promise to send it back to you . it 's routine , really . the actuarial people need to --

and they 're still married ... alan and sally ann .

he sighs .

boy , what the hell 's the matter with you ?

forgive me now for seeming personal , but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in provo .

check .

my parents were great fans of the former president .

god , i have n't seen you since the wedding .

you sure did .

away . i think it might take you a while to get your life back together . you do n't need me around . do n't go back in there .

maybe , fletch . is that brazil ?

sure you did .

fat sam is turning state 's evidence .

fletch ?

they busted me last week .

its okay . the cops did it .

hi sam . hi fletch .

that 's right .

where am i going ?

sure , all drifters do .

what 's the difference ? the noise 'll kill you first .

in this drawer ... .

i have the same problem with my help .

did it ever occur to you that i might not want to kill you ?

maybe i 'm just on vacation .

so why pick me ?

you do n't look sick , mr. stanwyk .

hopalong cassidy . killed himself here . bow and arrow . strange .

who ?

then i found out hopalong cassidy had shot himself in the game room . that just blew it for me .

will this proposition entail my dressing up as tina turner ?

i just thought ... sure . sally ann cavanaugh .

my hero .

did you say cops ?

no problem , boss .

shoot .

'magic ' today , huh ?

how long have they been married ?

i 'm sorry ?

cute young thing , too .

i thought you had this all figured out . good going 'irwin . '

you should n't be here .

do n't worry , i can take it .

are you telling me my husband is a bigamist ? ? ?

what is this ... .

oh god , i hate things that start like that ... .

i think you better sit down .

i 've never lied to him before . it 's the first time he 's ever lied to me . he was just as convincing as when he says ' i love you . '

no ... i 've got to go to mr. underhill ...

but i 've seen the deed .

swarthout . yes . he 's the man who sold us the ranch in --

have you ever heard the name jim swarthout ?

that 's what i want to know .

yeah . my name 's not john ultramalensky and i was n't at your wedding .

yeah .

i think you should call me gail , now .

long story .

what about his parents ?

oh , listen to me . i 've never even been there and look what i say about it . anyway , i know there 'd be nothing for me to do . i do n't even know anybody there .

good point .

utah is not exactly a cure for boredom .

thanks , i feel much better . listen , if you 're so bored , why did n't you go to utah with alan ?

can i ask you a question ?

your bone structure , shoulders , neck ...

you ordered it here ?

hi .

i have this effect on lots of women .

it 's scotch-rumanian .

john who ?

john ! you used to fly together !

your call is come through .

yes , sir . beluga . but it is eighty dollars the portion .

very good sir .

they just left , sir .

go ahead . call them . better tie your shoelaces first .

i 'm calling the cops . this is for the cops .

what did you want under the bed ?

what ?

i work for the landlord . he told me to watch out for the place .

no wonder .

the door was unlocked .

fletch .

i was upset .

their statements , naming chief cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to oxnard . i want them to have federal protection under the paper 's sponsorship .

this is fat sam , and this is gummy .

i 'm quitting , frank . as of midnight tonight .

thanks for the vote of confidence , frank .

all right . maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this .

cool your tool , frank , i need a little more time . i think i 'm really on to something here .

how gray ?

well , there we 're in a gray area .

you broke it ? you know the source ?

i never read the paper .

i will , frank , i will . something came up , okay ?

uh , almost .

and , i 'm sorry , who are you again ?

jim swarthout ?

i said , i ai n't got you ...

i said , i ai n't got you ...

no , i ai n't got you ...

that was close ...

damnit ... you were right last night . jonathan and i were into more than sex . along with bobby vomit , right after old jack grendel died , we took part in a scheme to rip off grendel records ... i did n't want you involved ...

thanks for the information . appreciate it .

question one : can i have some money ? kidding . why did n't you tell me about you and johnny ? you two were into something even more dangerous than sex , were n't you ? who ? what ? where ? how ? now .

i 'll do my best .

ouch ... of course i want off the case . some monster from woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight . the fact i 'm alive 's a technicality .

let 's see , you 're her worried sister . yesterday i met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you . in fact , i capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted . they talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook ... something about a ten-foot pole .

i need you to find my little sister . she goes by the name zuzu ...

could somebody tell me what 's going on ? < u > like slo-owly < /u > ...

tell me about it . name 's kyle troy . ca n't we bring up the bass .

i 'm not cynical . can i help it that life is a disease and everyone 's a victim . so you 're producing exclusively for grendel records now . hope you 're taking julian for a bundle .

wha --

i just ca n't deal with all this crap between us , i 'm sorry . i 'm quitting .

after their initial investment in the factory , grendel did n't need them . told them to fuck off . they tried to get these c.d.s together in order to have proof of grendel 's involvement , so they could keep him in line . now 's the fun part ...

what an interface !

hmmm , the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits . this one is putting out low bits . the data is in some fucked binary system . the two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc . comprendo ?

i believe the last time we came across one of these , was at the ballet . what were your words ... ' a fucking c.d . this case is closed . '

oh , jazz , those bastards ... call an ambulance ! get that music off !

i came to warn you ...

what are you doing at the office ? you would n't believe what i 've gone through tonight ... i 'm calling from the mega beta pogo sorority .

ms. sutton hired you to find the girl . period .

i do n't know , what was the case ?

i wish i knew . you did good work ...

cool . jazz , meet me at the dorothy chandler pavilion tonight . i 'll have a ticket for you at the door . some concert . could be interesting . dress nice .

quiet . tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about art mooney ...

i do it for love .

cash or check , jazz ? do n't do this to me .

exactly .

your tip paid off . jazz , this is sam the sleazebag . sam the sleazebag , this is jazz , my secretary .

scalping to a funeral , you 're a pretty sleazy guy .

you-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-vancouver-and there 's these-c.d.s ...

hey . god . you 're an asshole .

ick .

ye-ah .

this way ...

are you okay ?

stop . we still got serious detective stuff to do , but we 've been up all night so we should hit the sack for ...

no . who 's art mooney ?

peachy .

hello ?

what kind of sentimental bullshit is this ?

liar ! you do n't care ! about anything .

where 's my father ? have you even looked ?

and hey , i appreciate it ...

i 'm sorry ...

well what is it ? i 'm not kreskin .

why am i what ? excuse me ? i catch you saying the f-word again . i 'll kill you . that 's a fucking promise . now get the fuck out of here .

tell me , dr. watson , what makes you think he 's not just another piece of shit overdose .

that 's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of spam like you . you look at this picture and all you see is beauty . i see the beast .

have a problem , call ford fairlane . he wo n't solve your case , but who cares , you 'll be dead in a couple days anyway . let 's face it . after today , the california raisins are n't gon na hire you .

'booty time . '

disco ex -- man , that group sucked like a squid , they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug , back in my publicist days ...

how 's it going ?

< u > i 'm . the . biggest . sissy . in < /u > . < u > the . wide . world < /u > .

whatever you 're getting paid , i can give you twenty , maybe thirty bucks more .

julian , you 're fired .

what is this , are you holding a microphone behind my head ?

maybe later , but first i want like to know why you 'd steal from your own company ...

oh , wait . one sec . open the window .

so what did you think of the ballet ? was it like a warm ice capades ?

mmmmmmm . mmmm , mmm .

how could grendel records sign such a wick-prick ? i guess julian grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob . i hear ray charles is going to head up the video division .

it is to us ! it 's computerised .

hebedeebuh . hebedeebuh . maybe i did die in the explosion .

that 's funny , you 're cute .

friendship 's a lot different out here . a wrong number is a relationship . but then this is n't a social call .

fucking amazing , huh ? chevy nova , you bensonhurst shit ! still in la-la land . look at us , two rock ' n ' roll dicks . unfortunately , only one of us is a detective .

where do you want it ?

alain is the only man i know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman .

le sommes nous ?

comment va-t-elle ?

mmmmm . that bastard who followed me on the subway , he 's the eager one .

but will they ?

i 'm afraid they 've become a bit ... over-cautious . our american friends .

il est en retard .

chuck ... look .

it 's the last house on the left . she lives downstairs .

sure , just watch where you 're going .

after you left me that night , i did n't see you or talk to you again for a year . no one would tell me anything . all i know is what the police told me . we have nowhere to go unless you let me in . what happened ?

i do n't know . i do n't see you for months on end , and when i do , you put this wall between us . how do i break through ?

did you stay here last night ?

this door was open just a minute ago , was n't it ?

okay . there 's a whole weekend ahead of us . there 's time .

just slow down . let me get to know you again . let me get to know this place again .

you 're irresistible . i lose control .

i do n't know .

why ?

being a jerk is better than being nothing .

you do n't `` have to . ''

damn you , shelly !

you 've just learned a valuable lesson . a beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone .

it was nothing .

we had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang ... ... but shelly made them see the error of their ways .

look at it this way ... things can only get better ... right ?

stop the car ! now ! !

you 're the boss .

no time to explain . just listen . when i yell `` stop , '' you jam on the brakes as hard as you can . okay ?

i do n't see anything .

stop worrying . i do n't think they 'll bother to come after us .

is ... is everything all right ?

uh ... i guess i 'm just not hungry .

why do n't you help us ?

stick around and you 'll see .

hi .

my friggin ' stepfather and asshole- in-residence .

that 's a freakin ' fact . least of all us .

yeah ... we 're gon na scare him .

well , who told me to take this cow path ?

happy friday the 13th .

now wait a second ! i thought burt shot you .

it 's a damn company executive game , and she 's a damn company exec .

this is a man 's game . requiring a man 's cunning and intelligence ...

my ass .

all he 's asking is for you to check it out .

not what ... who . seems your boyfriend wants people to believe jason has returned .

how do you know ? did you take his temperature ?

come on , dad . you could have rick drive down cunningham road and look for them .

are you sure this is gon na work ? i mean , why did n't we bring that gun and just blast him away ?

hide it behind the gas station . then we can get the hell out of here .

tommy , my father is out looking for you right now . something happened tonight and he 's sure you 're responsible . if he finds you , he 'll ...

yeah , hi . listen , i 've got to talk to your dad . about jason . i 've got a plan . i need to buy some things first but mainly need help to ...

who ya calling ?

huh ?

are they grown-ups ?

no more .

nancy .

there was this monster . he was after me . he wanted to kill me .

of course not . she probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it . i still do n't get it . why him ? i mean , he 's cute alright , but ...

which is ?

does n't that tell you something ? !

if i had you where i really wanted you , they 'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde .

you got me where you want me . there 's no reason not ...

jason 's not in his coffin ! hawes is ! dig it up ! you got ta dig it up ! !

do n't concern yourself , martin . this boy needs treatment . we 're taking care of it . sorry for the disturbance .

i got ta show you jason 's grave .

yes !

you 're gon na be sorry you did n't listen to me .

now you better cool out a minute , boy . you already almost got your head blown to pieces .

they coulda danced a jig on it an ' fed it to goats -- do n't matter . ya ' ca n't kill jason by gettin ' rid of his body . he 'll come back the way he always do , to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull , mr. campbell .

eight times . they 've burned him , dipped him in nuclear waste --

eight times .

... but there just may not be enough time . if you still care about her , if you still want to try to make things better between you two ... we should talk .

then maybe i should offer it to your daughter ...

thirty . name your price . everyone has a price , what 's yours ?

look --

twenty .

you know he 's not ... and he 's coming for you .

i 'm kind of busy right now ...

so 's he and he knows it .

sorry , di . i was just going to my car . i did n't mean to frighten you ...

information like that is very expensive and you do n't have the balls to pay the price .

tell me !

goddamnit !

you 're talking about my lady .

jessica , i 'm so sorry . i ... i wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here .

have a good night .

is this anthony ? ... yeah , well , i just have one question for you , anthony -- did you fuck my dog ?

next , you dial a number .

jesus , steven , that 's ... that 's really lovely .

-- miscarriage ? ! who the fuck told you jessica had a miscarriage ? !

she asked me to come over . she said she had something to tell me .

until i hear the truth .

steven !

jason ... voorhees ?

the captain 's been murdered . the buzz is that jason might be on board .

nobody related to mcculloch can be nice .

a real space cadet . i wonder if she 'll narc on us ...

sounds good . i hear there 's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool ...

my parents are open minded about that sort of thing .

improvise , of course .

it 's my graduation gift from daddy . it cost over a thousand bucks but it 's the best .

i 'm sure we 'll have no problem getting them to party with us ... especially with this .

really ?

hear what ?

what 's wrong ?

do n't be ridiculous !

the fire alarm ...

what ? ? you sent her out there with a murderer running around loose ? ?

christ ... where 's rennie ? ?

it 's ... dead .

where did you get that alcohol ?

they 're out of town .

i'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes , miss mason . you 'd better have your biology project ready or i 'm phoning your parents .

i do n't think that 's such a safe idea

he 's the son of the captain , for chrissakes . you 'd think he 'd be able to operate this thing !

oh dear god ...

i thought i told you to stay away from her .

oh , i can see that . you 've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids , miss van deusen .

she 's fine , charles . take it easy ...

she does n't know what she wants . she 's never had a stable life .

and neither do you . it 's up to rennie to decide what she wants to do .

charles , there 's someone else coming along too .

am i ? let 's find out .

you can and you will ! !

i ... i ca n't ...

i 'm not staying in my room , uncle charles .

i 'm staying .

she did n't push me into coming .

only one young boy ever drowned in that lake , and that was before you were even born . his name was jason voorhees .

it 's not that simple .

i ca n't swim .

have you seen my dog anywhere ?

rennie , you 're the best student i ever had ... you have a real gift . if anybody can make use of that pen , it 's you .

stephen king supposedly used it when he was in high school .

everything okay ?

give me the degrees first , followed by minutes and sec ...

i 've got the numbers .

i ... i do n't know ...

you have to call the police ...

drugs ... then jason came . he 's here , sean .

we 'll be okay . i want you to wait by the lifeboats , just in case .

the window ...

i thought maybe we could hike to the top of the statue when we got there , if you felt like it . it 's supposed to be 22 stories tall .

that 's where i peed .

we must abandon .

what did you find ?

this is a great young out-of-work actress .

guys ready to order ?

she was very evasive .

paisley porter .

keep going west . last building before the river .

what ?

he 'll kill it . he 'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief . what happens to your apartment on the east river ? your house in connecticut , where you watch things grow .

he 'll hate it .

in other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse ? the man is out there ruining lives .

we 're making too much of this .

i gave it away . i thought , i 'm a writer now .

then you should carry a gun .

what about the haircut ?

where are you going ?

i say we go .

i recite it to myself with masochistic relish .

and he was there ?

what happened eighteen months ago ?

that 's what i said eighteen months ago .

what 's the fuss ? i do n't get it .

it is just a review . do not inhale . very dangerous .

you mean because what's-his-name .

shit . they do n't have any carrot soup .

that sounds so final . but are we really surprised ?

nicky . i was thinking about you . i went to the preview last night .

this could be it .

this could be it .

he will absolutely hate it .

it makes me so mad . steven schwimmer ready to strike . the exterminating angel .

the red sox blow a chance to win their first world series since 1918. you expect me to miss that for an opening night ?

because we 're completely mismatched .

we 're able to surprise each other .

this is how we 've managed to last .

what ?

steven schwimmer . the most powerful critic in america gets his first crack at nicky rogan .

i 've got bigger problems , joanna . personal problems .

what about her ?

you know about adele .

last night . alan albright called me a handsome woman . second time he 's done that . son of a bitch .

can we talk later ? will you be at the party ?

i do n't have a date . i do n't want a date .

your mother and i have something between us that 's too strong to damage permanently . believe me , i know this . that 's right , nineteen years . and what about the days and minutes ? sharing small moments , sharing memories , raising a beautiful child . we 're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways . lillian is n't only my wife . she 's my best friend .

oh please . not now . she wants you to stop seeing what's- her-name . finally . now and forever . do you think that 's too much to ask ? for a wife of nineteen years .

i just had breakfast with her . she did n't say a word about this .

is it ?

so at the intermission i can listen to the ball game . do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer ?

i 'm seeing your play tonight , remember ?

what do you want to talk about ? i 'll talk about anything . what 's this ?

do you want to get some coffee ?

what else ?

yes . and no more evasive tactics .

mystery . deception .

yes .

brilliantly moving .

you have to tell me what you thought of the play .

she 's my gynecologist .

i had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this ?

i want to know . we have n't talked this way in years .

there may be things you 'd rather not know about .

i 'd forgotten that .

that 's always been my problem .

opening night , lillian .

i do n't want to be responsible for his food . just a small green salad . and a perrier .

all right . what 's been going on ?

your father said you might be here .

this could be it !

all the failures , all the fatalism .

life is good .

show him who we are .

so what are you going to do about it ?

normal boy 's ambition . i like coming back . you know that .

do n't make me sit through one of your plays .

you 'll need these . tonight . for the play .

of course they 're gon na lose . we 'll watch them lose . what good is heartbreak if we do n't experience it firsthand ?

you know the answer to that .

get yourself something to eat .

across ninth avenue . dodgie 's . where you 've been getting your hair cut for fifty years . where uncle billy and uncle marty got their hair cut . where jim rorty shot a man for cheating at poker .

right here . at the door .

i 'm at the door .

who is it ?

all the times i died when the red sox lost an important game they should have won . all the awful things i said to my mother and father . to tmy wife and daughter .

because god loves a winner .

life is good .

i want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments .

i want to believe .

you 're afraid to risk believing . believe in them . believe in your self . take a risk . it will humanize you as a person .

`` it looked extremely rocky for the boston nine that day . ''

you made him strike out . you wished it on him . you want to lose . it 's too hard for you to believe in something . it 's hard to have faith . it 's hard nwork to trust somebody .

winning is easy . losing is complicated . it 's a lifetime 's work .

it 's complicated . it 's a whole life . a person does n't commit an act of violence out of nowhere . there are strong forces at work .

you 're charming the boy .

now that 's a complicated subject .

a grandmother . god bless you .

you 're frankie lazzaro . the gangster from rhode island .

you 're out of bullets .

i was six years old the day pesky hesitated throwing home and slaughter scored all the way from first . that 's when i knew the red sox were my team . pity and terror .

because i ca n't bear to watch . when they lose , i die inside . it 's like some little person named steve just crumples up and dies . i wait for the scores . i still die , hearing the scores , but it 's over in a second . i ca n't survive the game pitch by pitch , inning by inning . i 've done it too many times . and i ca n't do it anymore .

why do you care ?

if they lost tonight , they 'll lose tomorrow . it 's all over .

why does it matter ?

postpone . we have every right .

i had lunch with joanna . she said she told you about peter . you were n't concerned , she said .

aybe we ought to postpone the opening .

eleventh inning . what else ?

why ?

i can see her face so clearly . dear god . my heart was flying out of my chest with love .

yes .

you have to see the words . try to build a mental picture of the script . imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen .

sidney fabrikant . our producer .

i 'm actually beginning to enjoy this .

yes .

there 's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid . is that our steven ?

where are you going now ?

do you think he can do it ?

he wears a disguise .

the fact is , i have to get going .

i 'm trying to prolong our afternoon . in case you have n't noticed .

peter redmond is an actor i admire enormously .

you keep slipping away . how do you do that ?

what ?

a little drastic maybe ?

engaging .

you 've worked with elliot ?

it is the work of untouchables .

sora was sent to tell me i -- i must rake and cover the latrine .

nothing 's more dangerous , especially for an old man .

you really are going to pakistan , then ? you are a stubborn man .

what do you expect when you talk like that ?

is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that ?

not without defeats -- and great pain . but are there no defeats in this war -- no pain ? what you can not do is accept injustice . from hitler -- or anyone . you must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so .

stop !

it does . we must be getting old , charlie .

let me hang on with two hands or i will fall .

that 's the sort of thing you 'll be seeking on this `` farm '' ...

not anymore . at first i was amazed ... but when you are fighting in a just cause , people seem to pop up -- like you -- right out of the pavement . even when it is dangerous or --

... and i knew something had to give . and i was determined to be here when it did .

no , no -- just a moment , please .

a -- a week .

`` hell ! ''

tell me -- do you think about hell ?

what do you want ?

and jinnah ?

we must end the campaign .

i 've never spoken for anything else .

we only make wild speeches , or perform even wilder acts of terrorism . we 've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the british anywhere .

i 've traveled so far -- and thought so much . as you can see , my city was a sea city -- always filled with hindus and muslims and sikhs and jews and persians . the temple where you were yesterday is of my family 's sect , the pranami . it was hindu of course but the priests used to read from the muslim koran and the hindu gita , moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as god was worshipped .

even as a boy i thought so .

i 'm sure i 'm fit for at least five hundred miles .

good . ba will have to teach you to spin too .

i will not sit by to see the mastery of the british replaced by the mastery of the hindus !

i mean a day of prayer and fasting . but of course no work could be done -- no buses , no trains , no factories , no administration . the country would stop .

i 'll send my gardener . i 'm sure you 'll have much to discuss .

the honor is ours . may i introduce mr. kallenbach . he 's an old friend and his interest is in flowers . i presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked .

we need your help !

i am beginning to know mr. nehru .

no .

i 'm hardly that , mr. patel .

who is that young man ?

the fools ! sorry ...

my wife publicly defied the law . they 've arrested her and four others .

that was england .

very well .

perhaps some tea ?

i do n't know ! nehru , patel , almost every congress official is in jail ... and their wives and their children -- we 've even arrested nehru 's mother .

who 's leading them ?

in calcutta it 's like civil war . the muslims rose and there was a bloodbath , and now the hindus are taking revenge -- and if we ca n't stop it there 'll be no hope for the hindus left in pakistan .

ah -- we should invite gandhi . what the devil has happened to him anyway ?

too late for that . we 're closer to the other side .

i will prove it to you . come swim with me now , vincent . now -- tonight .

who are you trying to convince ?

well ? you have all the answers . how is that possible ?

how much extra ?

i 'll take care of it .

i 'll see what i can do .

no ? what 's keeping you ?

it 's not < i > exactly < /i > him .

we 'll vacuum these streets if we have to .

something 's not right .

no . but one or two `` borrowed ladders '' have shown up there in the past .

a customer ? does this michael 's cater to misfits ?

-- there 's that word again . i have a feeling this man does n't play the odds , detective . not exactly a slave to probability . is it `` likely '' that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years -- a brutal killer -- is going to come to us now like a lamb ?

we 're in the wrong place . we 're wasting time .

i 'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections --

so there 's a 20 percent chance he 's < i > not < /i > dead .

with respect , sir -- it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests --

grudges ?

i will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission . we 're already counting backwards .

this time i will supervise each test personally .

often .

how often do you test , director ?

i 've been looking for him . do you know where he is ?

good to see you 're feeling better .

jerome -- ?

i do n't know exactly , jerome .

listen , i do n't want you to think i 'm ungrateful -- i know you and that little broker -- what do you call him ?

i think i 'd better choose the menu . after all , you 're learning how to be me , i 'm not learning how to be < i > you < /i > .

i got the better end of the deal . i just lent you my body -- you lent me your dream .

thank you .

in case you get back before i do .

how the hell did you get here .

how are you , jerome ?

how would you like to be yourself for the day ?

do n't worry about your little pin cushion . to be honest , i 'm looking forward to having the place to myself .

will you be okay ?

where are you taking her ?

she 's already got her doubts . i have to act like nothing 's wrong .

she does n't < i > have < /i > to know . she does n't < i > want < /i > to know .

of course not . but she 's have to know eventually .

you 're not thinking of telling her , are you ?

you know how it is with these altered births -- somebody told her she 's not going to live forever and she 's been preparing to die ever since .

how was your evening ?

never stopped you before . and for god 's sake stop plucking your hair . someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you would n't go bald .

if you say so . the stripe .

so it 's not just the hoovers who 've got you rattled .

i 'm sorry . i think i was crying .

and keep your lashes on your lids where they belong . how could you be so careless ?

how could they recognize you ? < i > i < /i > do n't recognize you . anyway , you do n't have a choice . you run , you may as well sign a confession , turn us both in right now . no , we stick this out -- find out what we can but change nothing . this is a minor inconvenience is all it is . we 've taken worse heat than this . jesus , if i 'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp , i would n't have bothered . you ca n't quit on me now . i 've put too much into this . besides , this stuff is < i > mine < /i > . i had other offers , you know . i could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine . you want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself ? we 'll take off all right , from pad 18 just like we planned .

call german .

it 's all right .

-- what car ? -- go to sleep .

you know i 'm scared of heights .

let 's get out of here .

they found him in his office this morning -- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag .

you wish .

who died ?

leave ? just a few million years ago every atom in this hair -- in our bodies -- was a part of a star . i do n't see it as leaving . i see it as going home .

< i > more < /i > than that . you 'll get used to it .

you had to be a right-hander .

they are not babies , maria , merely `` human possibilities '' .

what will happen to the others ?

anything i 've forgotten ?

first , we may as well decide on gender . have you given it any thought ?

there 's a way .

you can wear lifts .

how tall are you ?

why are you inventing problems ? you two are a couple of goddam clones . you look so right together , i want to double my fee .

yeah .

how do i square the accident ?

they said the same thing about myopia and obesity . you think your children would be less human if they were less violent , angry , spiteful ? maybe they 'd be < i > more < /i > human . from where i sit the world could stand a little improving .

not that .

you worried about the cost ?

not so long -- just once around the sun .

it 's not safe . i should n't have brought you here .

who are they ?

why are we leaving ?

of course .

nothing yet . i 'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties . but unless they come up with something between now and then , i wo n't live much past 67 .

they found an eyelash .

why would we do that ?

just remember , lamar , i could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser --

there 's a problem , lamar .

what 's this , lamar ?

if everything goes to plan , this could be the last time i see you for a while . one week to go . please tell me you 're the least bit excited .

jerome ... never shy . pisses on command . you 've got a beautiful cock . i ever told you that , jerome ?

the doctor will give you something .

i ca n't do this .

one . the radio 's rappin ' about $ 750^000 . we only got a half a million .

news said two persons killed .

stay clean .

sure , you 're working on the passports ... ... and visas ?

you run the job , but i run the show . you got two weeks to set it up .

this is the only time you and i meet in public . any business with me , handle it with him ...

hard to judge how these things happen . the parole board almost never reverses their decisions .

all it takes is a long arm .

i guess we are .

whatever happens ... we 're going all the way .

pull over .

they will have our description before we can get a plane .

i do n't know , airport i guess .

you okay ?

what is it ?

you and me .

things ca n't get much worse can they ?

you want to try with me ?

no more about beynon .

either we pick it up or else we leave it right here . we got to go one way or another .

we got this far .

i do n't think we can any more ... if we ever get out of here , maybe i should take off ...

we 're going to make it .

not now .

are you hungry ?

twenty eight hundred .

where are you going ?

from now on you just shut up and do as you 're told .

that would be the first time .

you 're full of ifs .

why , there 's nothing on the news ?

like what ?

you do n't like the way things are , i do n't like the way things

i can handle it .

how long ago .

he must have .

when i got out , why did n't you tell me where it was ?

if we make a mistake. , he 'll burn us . you make a deal , you 're always better keeping your end up .

so what . i 've got to give him his money . that was our end of the deal .

i see it ...

what about the bank ?

you know i 've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes ... worn out waiting .

waiting 's hard . you never learn how .

usually on the right side as you go in .

... bank president , three tellers and one guard ...

want to cry now ?

but sometimes i cried a lot too .

why are you laughing ?

is he straight ?

yeah , well , i think i 'll stick with what i 've got .

i bought you a lot of new things .

really ?

listen , i 'm just as nervous as you are .

we 've got time . we 've got a lot of time . i can help you .

after four years and now the question comes up .

how does it taste ?

good .

i hope so . i am not looking forward to another stretch .

you okay ?

stands and pauses for a moment .

no , i 'm afraid not .

you would n't be taking the train to salt lake , would you ?

where 's home ?

me , too . got twenty-four days of furlough and i 'm goin ' home .

one thing though ... how do i explain this to my wife ?

might try that .

are n't we going a little hard ?

i 'm handling the fine stuff . you 're back up all the way ...

wire pull over ?

right .

well , i paid a hell of a price . now for god 's sake keep your mouth shut .

do n't worry about me , i 'll grab a cab ... i can afford it , you know .

sure am .

come on . how much ?

which way ?

why not ?

mexico . i 'd like to find a quiet place to cross .

just fine .

drive .

i 've got to stop .

i got a nurse in mind .

yes , but listen . christ , i did n't kill him .

what did he say ?

yes . i told him .

did eric know that frank was my brother ?

cliff brumby . he 'd seen the film . he wanted to meet doreen .

who ?

no choice . i had a visit from somebody .

a couple of weeks back .

i dunno . he 's got his ways . he knows margaret .

was he ?

he was drunk . drunk as a lord .

how 'd it happen , then ?

what about the brakes ?

well , he drove it into the river .

this is my brother 's car .

what do you want ?

you should n't have shown the film to frank .

why ?

yes .

bloody well tell me who sent you .

who sent you , thorpey ?

no , do n't jack , do n't .

you stay in the car . i 'll come and listen . what you want to tell me , thorpey ?

i 'd like a word with you , jack .

he was gentlemanly . i like that .

yes . i ca n't help the way i am .

though nicer than most ?

but he was just another feller , was n't he ?

tomorrow morning , then ?

i ca n't .

what about ?

fine ... i want to talk to you .

and you did n't know her last name ?

the girl 's name was doreen . that 's all i know .

tell me about the girl .

you sure about that ?

not entirely . no .

was he ?

yes , while he was here .

really ?

we went about together .

really ?

oh yes . when he came up on business .

who ?

do you ?

thanks for coming .

no . i 'll be off now . i should be at work .

do n't worry . she 's bound to be upset .

yeah . a bloody funny thing !

where you going to live , then ?

no .

you coming to south america ?

working at woolworths .

oh yes ? how ?

how 'd you find me ?

yeah .

four of them .

said he 'd heard you were up in town . wondered if i knew where you was staying . wanted to look you up . old time 's sake .

that 's what he was saying about you .

heard of a man called thorpe ?

i mean , i was surprised when he did n't turn up for work . he was always on time .

i 'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'rule , britannia ' .

and that 'll make me feel better ?

do us a favour ?

no . i 'm not tired , do you eat breakfast ?

no . are you tired ?

are you tired ?

yes , thank you .

did you sleep well ?

no .

are you awake ?

so shut up .

what am i supposed to do ? i do n't know where they 've taken him . do you ?

you 're lucky . they kill as well .

do n't ask me .

yes , edna , and i must say you 've been great about the ...

you do n't look it .

what the bloody hell do you think you 're at ?

my brother , frank .

it never is .

still got your sense of humour .

sod off .

yes , i retained that , eric . do you know a man called albert swift , eric ?

so you 're doing all right then , eric . you 're making good .

oh , you 've been watching television .

what are you doing ? advertising martini ?

very ... so , who you working for these days eric ?

oh , i 'm sorry to hear that .

no . i 'm visiting relatives .

no , i did n't know that .

is he ?

yeah , i 'll do that . told you it would n't take long , did n't i ?

nasty way to go .

no ? funny that . neither did i .

shut up .

he said it 'd be doing him a big favour .

knock it off , gerald .

ask jack . it 's his old stamping ground .

calling my bluff , are you , harry ?

that 's right .

four hundred ?

that 's six hundred pounds , harry . two hundred to follow you , and i 've raised it four hundred .

three hundred altogether ?

what 's that ?

yes .

in the abstract ...

well , well , well , talk to me , we sat down to eat dinner , and here i 'm a criminal ...

then tough luck , george , because you are .

that 's ridiculous .

no .

why would they come to me ?

what if you do n't get caught ?

what does that mean ?

yes .

you want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads ?

i 'm sorry ?

he would take you on . yes .

you 're saying `` me . ''

a buck a shot .

did you ?

well . well ...

as a `` robbery '' ? ! no .

no .

we 're just `` talking '' about it .

you have n't talked to him .

graff ? because i worked for him .

what could somebody get for them ?

what ?

they ...

that 's right ...

of doing the thing . the dif ... the difference . between me and jerry graff . going to business for yourself . the hard part is ... you know what it is ?

no , it 's not that simple , dave ...

the leads , the overhead , the telephones , there 's lots of things .

that 's what i 'm saying . why ? the leads . he 's got the good leads ... what are we , we 're sitting in the shit here . why ? we have to go to them to get them . huh . ninety percent our sale , we 're paying to the office for the leads .

you hear a lot of things ... he 's doing very well . he 's doing very well .

he 's doing very well .

nurses .

... sales promotion , `` you lose , then we fire your ... '' no . it 's medieval ... it 's wrong . `` or we 're going to fire your ass . '' it 's wrong .

... cower in his boots ...

no . that 's absolutely right .

eh ?

i know it 's not . i 'll tell you , you got , you know , you got ... what did i learn as a kid on western ? do n't sell a guy one car . sell him five cars over fifteen years .

i ...

i , i ... i ...

they killed the goose .

they did .

i ... i do n't know .

mmm ...

you have to cheer up , george , you are n't out yet .

all of 'em . they , hey : it happens to us all .

... they hold on to their money ...

do you understand ? my stuff is mine , his stuff is ours . i 'm taking half of his commissions -- now , you work it out .

they 're inured to it .

thieves .

no .

no .

why do n't you think so ?

the cops ?

to the cops ?

he said we ...

what ?

they stole the phones . they stole the leads . they 're ... christ . what am i going to do this month ? oh , shit ...

what . what kind of outfit are we running where ... where anyone ...

you hit a bad streak . we 've all ... look at this : fifteen units mountain view , the fucking things get stole .

that 's ...

clear meadows . that shit 's dead .

yes . they are old .

i did n't rob ...

rick , i 'm going to flag a cab .

we had a robbery .

thank you , george .

shelly , the machine , levene .

mmm .

will you get out of here . will you get out of here . will you . i 'm trying to run an office here . will you go to lunch ? go to lunch . will you go to lunch ?

just go to lunch .

the leads come in , i 'll let ...

i 'm going to the chinks . you 're done , come down , we 're going to smoke a cigarette .

mr. levene , i think we have to talk .

hey , fella , let 's get this done ...

you stupid fucking cunt . you , williamson ... i 'm talking to you , shithead ... you just cost me six thousand dollars . six thousand dollars . and one cadillac . that 's right . what are you going to do about it ? what are you goin to do about it , asshole . you fucking shit . where did you learn your trade . you stupid fucking cunt . you idiot . whoever told you you could work with men ?

i 'm talking with mr. lingk . if you please , i 'll be back in . i 'll be back in a while ... i told you , check with mr. williamson .

listen to me , the statute , it 's for your protection . i have no complaints with that , in fact , i was a member of the board when we drafted it , so quite the opposite . it says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed .

aaronow ...

... did they ...

excuse me , fella .

did they get my contracts ?

williamson ... williamson , they stole the contracts ... ?

how much did you get for them ? how much did you get for them ?

you said , `` you do n't make something up unless it 's sure to help . '' how did you know that i made it up ?

how do you know i made it up ?

excuse me ...

you listen to me , someday you might say , `` hey ... '' no , fuck that , you just listen what i 'm going to say : your partner depends on you . your partner ... a man who 's your `` partner '' depends on you ... you have to go with him and for him ... or you 're shit , you 're shit , you ca n't exist alone ...

'' `` shelly , he 's out . '' you 're gone before i 'm back from lunch . i bought him a trip to bermuda once ...

twenty percent .

you 're saying that i 'm fucked .

it is n't me ...

shelly , you blew the last ...

... shut up . decide who should be dealt with how ? is that the thing ? i come into the fuckin ' office today , i get humiliated by some jagoff cop . i get accused of ... i get this shit thrown in my face by you , you geniune shit , because you 're top name on the board ...

i got 'em in the kitchen . i 'm eating her crumb cake .

`` ... you have to believe in yourself ... ''

twelve-fifteen .

ah . ah , his wife is . ray : what time do you have ... ?

no , his wife is .

well , ray was eating at one of his company 's men 's home in france ... the man 's french , is n't he ?

`` home cooking '' ... what did you call it , you said it ... it was a tag phrase that you had , , ,

which ...

mr. morton 's with american express ... he 's ... i can tell jim what you do ... ?

well , we 'll do that this weekend .

yes .

no , mr. roma . i do n't need the time , i 've made a lot of investments in the last ...

the hell with him . we 'll go to lunch , the leads wo n't be up for ...

... yes ...

bullshit , you 're ... no . that 's raw ... well , if i did , then i 'm glad i did . i , well . i locked on them . all on them , nothing on me . all my thoughts are on them . i 'm holding the last thought that i spoke : `` now is the time . '' they signed , ricky . it was great . it was fucking great . it was like they wilted all at once . no gesture ... nothing . like together .

bruce ... '' i do n't want to fuck around with you . i do n't want to go round this , and pussyfoot around the thing , you have to look back on this . i do , too . i came here to do good for you and me . for both of us . why take an interim position ?

`` always be closing ... ''

`` what we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity ... and take it . and that 's it . '' and we sit there . i got the pen out ...

how was it ... ?

just now .

shelly ... !

what did i tell you ? what did i say about the three days ... ?

and the check is ...

what ?

i ...

i do . if i do n't get my money back ...

no . she told me `` right now . ''

she wants her money back .

you tell me again .

i told you .

i told you .

what is ?

the check was n't cashed ?

today . today . which , in any case , it was not , as there were a couple of points on the agreement i wanted to go over with you in any case .

what was the earliest it could have been cashed ?

what was yesterday ?

i 'm not .

that 's what they are . three business ... i wait till monday , my time limit runs out .

of course you have three days .

three days .

i do n't know , the attorney gen ... the ... some consumer office , um ...

it 's a common reaction , jim . i 'll tell you what it is , and i know that that 's why you married her . one of the reasons is prudence . it 's a sizable investment . one thinks twice ... it 's also something women have . it 's just a reaction to the size of the investment . monday , if you 'd invite me for dinner again ... this woman can cook ...

my wife ...

i 've got to talk to you ...

jim ! what are you doing here ? jim lingk , d. ray morton ...

i 've got to talk to you .

what do i ... ?

`` fuck the machine '' ? `` fuck the machine '' ? what is this . courtesy class ... ? you 're fucked , rick -- are you fucking nuts ? you 're hot , so you think you 're the ruler of this place ... ? ! you want to ...

you have a mean streak in you , ricky , you know that ... ?

you just this morning ...

when ...

guess who ?

you did that ?

yeah . he closed a deal .

you hear what i said ?

fuckin ' cop 's got no right talk to me that way . i did n't rob the place ...

fuck you , ricky . i ai n't going out today . i 'm going home . i 'm going home because nothing 's accomplished here ... anyone talks to this guy is ...

your contract went out to the bank .

what 's the fucking point in any case ... ? what 's the point . i got to argue with you , i got to knock heads with the cops , i 'm busting my balls , sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress , i come back you ca n't even manage to keep the contracts safe , i have to go back and close them again ... what the fuck am i wasting my time , fuck this shit . i 'm going out and reclose last week 's ...

patel ? ravidam patel ? how am i going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs ? where did you get this , from the morgue ?

'cause i do n't have to eat this month . no . okay . give 'em to me ... fucking mitch and murray going to shit a br ... what am i going to do all ...

with what ? with what , john , they took the leads ...

the ...

they got , listen to me ...

i was taller than you when i was fourteen .

some day you will .

why do you have to go ?

i ca n't .

i know . how long will you be gone ?

i 'm leaving very early tomorrow , before you wake up .

on your pillow .

they were friends .

are you alright ?

that 's right .

mr. cicci . from the year 1927 to the present time , you were an employee of the & quot ; genco olive oil company. & quot ;

oh yes , the very best .

no . he would give it away . i know how to repay a consideration .

vitone ! our driver has drunk too much wine .

you know his friends ... real animals . and his connections with the police . sure he 'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude . then they would owe him a favor ; that 's how he operates . we 'll have to pay . three hundred , are we agreed ?

that scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler . he wo n't take a dime less than three hundred dollars .

she could n't decide .

it means we should all live happily for one hundred years . the family . if my father were alive , it 'd be true .

you go see your children first , and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else .

the children can stay .

i want to talk to you , michael .

is kay coming ?

connie , i want to be reasonable with you . you have a house here , with us . you can live here with your kids ... and you wo n't be deprived of anything . i do n't know much about merle ; i do n't know what he does for a living ; what he lives on . why do n't you tell him marriage is really out of the question ; and that you ca n't see him any more . he 'll understand . but if you disobey me , and marry this pimp ... it would disappoint me .

michael ...

whatsamatter , you do n't want me to dance with him 'cause he 's a man !

he 's the head of the family .

i hate to see you cringe in front of him . how come you 're so scared of your own kid brother ?

listen , michael 's got a lot of nice people here . friends of kay 's . he 'll never forgive me if you ruin his party .

you would risk your life for strangers ?

would you like some ?

the child can not harm you .

he is weak .

you tell your friends i expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner . do n't be afraid to tell them . clemenza and i know each other well , he understands these things . let yourself be guided by him . he has more experience in these matters .

my two friends have my share of the money . i 'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler .

let 's go .

why 'd you do it , frankie ? after all these years , why 'd you turn against him ?

yeah , some deal i made .

we have a special home for you for the rest of your life . nobody gets near you . you 're not going any place .

my life wo n't be worth a nickel after tomorrow .

we were all upset about that .

it 's the way pop wanted it .

he said there was something good in it for me ... me on my own .

i did n't know it was a hit . i swear to you i did n't know . johnny ola contacted me in beverly hills -- said he wanted to talk . he said you and roth were in on some big deal , and there was a place for me in it if i could help them out . they said you were being tough on the negotiation , and if they had a little bit of help , they could close it fast and it would be good for you .

we have time .

mikey , why would they ever hit poor old frankie five-angels ? i loved that ole sonuvabitch . i remember when he was just a 'button , ' when we were kids . we used to put bedsheets on our heads , you know , like we were ghosts . an ' ole frankie come peek into our room , we 'd jump up , and he 'd always pretend like he was really scared . you remember ?

no .

i never looked down on you , fredo . you do n't look down at a brother .

jeeze , it 's great you came along , mike ... you know , we 've never spent a night out on the town together . i always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time .

me and you , great ! gim me an hour to wash my face and do my research and we 'll have these washington suckers right where you want 'em . poor frankie five-angels . he always wanted to die in bed ... with a broad .

tonight i want to relax with you . the senator from nevada is here with some people from washington . i want to show them a good time in havana .

i want you to help me , fredo .

i never met them .

oh . mikey , what 's up ? i 'm totally in the dark .

it 's all right . he stays with me all the time .

oh , 'scuse me .

forget it , just go take care of her .

he took the money . now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood , including papa .

why ?

why ? why does he bother other italians ?

he 's an italian ?

that 's the first time i 've seen the lawyer side of you , tom . it 's not your best side .

you do n't know that 's true . but kay , just for the sake of an argument , let 's assume it is , i 'm not saying it is , remember , but ... what if i gave you what might be some justification for what he did ... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did .

what kind of a family is this ... are we human beings ? he knows his father killed his uncle carlo . he heard connie .

i 'm supposed to stay in my house .

yes .

she 's gone , tom .

it 's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when i was consigliere to sonny .

i can feel it in the way he talks to me .

she took a flight to san francisco . we figure she 's going to connect to new hampshire ; her parents ' place .

i know . i went down to the barrett house . but she 's gone . they drove her and the kids to north tahoe airport .

i 'm staying . do n't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this ; sonny never listened to me about that . now , explain everything to me .

good . then you 're staying .

why do you hurt me , michael ? i 've always been loyal to you .

are you so hungry for traitors ; do you want to find them everywhere ?

i do n't like it when you use the word impossible ; nothing is impossible ...

his medical condition is reported as ... & quot ; terminal. & quot ;

they can come in now .

my information is that fredo thought it was a kidnapping . roth assured him nothing would happen to you .

i want you to reach fredo . i know he 's scared , but have one of our people reach him . assure him that there will be no reprisals . tell him that i know roth misled him .

i asked about fredo ?

what was it , so i 'll know .

i took care of it .

do you think they have somebody to back up cicci ?

mikey , i hoped ...

tom is n't going to sit in with us , johnny . he only handles specific areas of the family business . tom ?

he 's going to try panama ...

how do i know you have n't gone into business for yourself ?

your plans are a little different this time . you skip miami , and go straight to geneva . it 's to be deposited to this number . and it 's got to be there by monday morning , no slip-up .

we 've never sent this much with one courier .

you were around the old timers who dreamed up how the families should be organized , how they based it on the old roman legions , and called them 'regimes ' ... with the 'capos ' and 'soldiers , ' and it worked .

thanks ... friend .

simple . be friendly like us . not hostile .

you paid off thirty grand i never owed .

a little ; what 's so thought- provoking about that ?

no strings .

actually , i 've come with good news ; the corleone family has done you a favor .

sir , the gentleman does not understand english . he would not in any case , take the stand . he came , at his own expense , to aid his brother in his trouble . he is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable .

is he related to the witness ?

if you could just give us a list , we 'll pick up anything you want .

oh , i do feel things for you , michael ; but now , i think it 's pity . for the first time since i 've known you , you seem so helpless . you held me a prisoner once ; will you try again ?

michael .

i did n't even know he had a brother . and where is he now ?

tell me , michael . what really happened with pentangeli ?

i think it 's too late for changes , michael . i promised myself i would n't talk about it and i 've gone and spoiled it .

i 'm sorry , michael . senator geary 's here , and mr. and mrs. barrett wanted to thank you before they left . wo n't you join us , mr. ola ?

who 's asking ?

no , i meant lose his family .

you talk about the baby . she can have another baby .

why ... the rosato brothers .

six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution .

this doubles my investment .

the money was sent .

my concern is that the three million never arrived at batista 's numbered account in switzerland . he thinks it 's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels .

i still do n't speak spanish , michael .

then it 's done . i must choose his replacement : it can not be rosato .

what a mistake ; people behaving like that , with guns . it was my understanding we left all that behind . but , let me tell you , the important thing is that you 're all right . good health is the most important thing ; more than success ; more than power ; more than money .

i like sporting events -- i really enjoy watching them in the afternoon . one of the things i love about this country . i loved baseball ever since arnold rothstein fixed the world series of 1919 ... i heard you had some trouble .

not for a few years .

it occurred to me : the police are paid to fight , and the rebels are not .

this is it ! we think it makes vegas look like the corner crap game .

he always makes money for his partners . one by one , our old friends are gone . death , natural or not , prison , deported . our friend in miami is the only one left , because he always made money for his partners .

is there anything i can do ; anything i can send ?

not good .

i do not .

frankie , roth tried to have me killed . i 'm sure it was him , but i do n't know yet why .

then why do you want me to lay down to them ?

it would be the beginning of the end for my family . how can i keep all my other territories in like if i let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that , and then give it to them ?

i was just going to contact you , michael ; we just had a 'sit-down ' - in fact , i just come from there .

michael , anything . what is it i can do for you ?

i want you to help me take my revenge .

in my home ! in the same room where my wife was sleeping ; where my children come in their pajamas , and play with their toys .

he did business ... but he never trusted him .

you give your loyalty to a jew over your own blood .

we were all heartbroken at the news ; but that was n't cause to start a war .

senator geary , i speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state . i have made that state my home ; plan to raise my children here . the license fee from the gambling commission costs one thousand dollars ; why would i ever consider paying more ?

no , she 's here .

no sign of them yet ; but they 're still on the estate .

what about michael corleone ?

you want a war ?

do n't i look like i 'm listening ?

you was n't listening , you did n't want to talk .

we worked it all out beforehand .

sitting right behind you .

i accept your generosity ...

in fact , reduced , bu five dollars !

what was that ?

excuse me , i hope i am not a disturbance , don corleone .

here is the six month 's increase in advance . you need n't speak to her about it , she 's a proud woman . see me again in another six months . but of course , you 'll let her keep her dog .

eh ... five dollars more .

i told her i would speak to you , that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding . she has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble , so why should n't she stay . as one italian to another , i ask you the favor .

i 'm not a kid .

if you enjoy it , you should do it .

hey , no strings , right ? that 's what you always said . just good pals who have the hots for each other .

you picked up that girl right in front of me .

he 's an artist . anyway , he 's too old to think about sex .

it never crossed your mind ?

i was n't going to try anything .

it means it 's too cold to go swimming . and i do n't mean the water .

what 's that mean ?

what 's to be jealous of ?

this looks corny .

not anymore you do n't . doll .

fuck you .

i say let loverboy watch his movie . and be grateful boone 's not cutting shirley temple 's lawn .

thanks , doll .

you must leave . you were not here this morning .

thanks . why do you do it ?

i blame my daughter for keeping me out so late . i only hope you did not get him excited . it could give him a new stroke .

there is nothing you can say that will surprise me .

i 'm not going to hurt anyone .

yes ! you know ?

a homo ?

sins of the flesh ? everybody has those .

then you 're as single as i am .

a man who is not married has nothing . he is a man of trouble . you need a woman .

your wife ?

no . we live simply , mr. jimmy and i. people come to play bridge . and now and then , young men to swim . you have people , boone ?

tea is fine .

the master is dressing . i am to offer you a drink . there is whiskey and there is iced tea .

no . no . i am sorry . forget everything i say . here . i will take the tray .

all right .

pray you , undo this button .

need some help ?

relax , clayton . i ca n't hear you . i ca n't hear a word .

please , clayton . just for a minute . long enough for me to see the effect .

do n't move .

what did you expect ? bronze ?

you are much too human .

so it is going to happen after all .

barnett . barnett on the wire .

i said it must be weird seeing your monsters again , and you said , `` the only monsters are here . '' i was wondering which here you meant .

the morning after pearl harbor , he drove down to st. louis to reenlist . he was so damn excited . world war ii was going to be his second chance . they told him he was too old ... fat ... nearsighted . said he 'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family .

but you said --

i never made it to korea .

i 'd like to try again . if you 're game .

i thought you 'd given up on my picture .

very sporting of you , clayton .

we 're not sugar . we wo n't melt .

let 's get out of this funk hole

ca n't you see ? it 's raining !

actually , no . i feel a little out of place .

girl ? oh . elizabeth taylor .

no . the girl .

i do n't hear anything .

good afternoon , clayton .

if you do n't mind driving , i 'd like to take you as my guest . there should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused .

it was foolishness to attempt this portrait . you can not force what will not flow .

my apologies . i had no business snapping at you .

i want -- i want ...

of course i remember . do you think i 'm so senile --

something happened to him ?

you were a soldier ?

you 're talking through your hat now .

oh , there may not be atheists in the foxholes , but there are occasionally lovers .

you must think the whole world is queer . well it 's not . war sure is n't .

not fear . more like disgust .

you first .

i assure you , mr. boone , i meant no --

i think we all want to feel we 've left our mark on the world . yes . i wish i had done more work .

it 's so far in the past now . over fifteen years --

ah . a philosopher .

the world is just one kiss-ass game after another . a man has to make up his own life , alone .

very well put .

you know how it is . you have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it .

why not ?

suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders ? two buttons . is that so much to ask ? just two little buttons .

sorry . not today .

i hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today ?

i never thought you were .

oh dear . if one must have a clinical name .

no , i -- you 're a homosexual .

you ever been married , mr. whale ?

all righty . i understand .

sorry . i do n't feel like sitting still today .

no . i could have , though .

did you kill anyone ?

why ? was it supposed to be funny ?

that shirt , mr. boone .

you do n't say ? which picture ?

excellent . we 'll have a most interesting time .

i have no interest in your body , mr. boone . i can assure you of that .

and it 's just my head you want ? nothing else ?

just a year . i dropped out to join the marines .

you went to university ?

sat for an artist . been sketched .

huh ?

i returned recently from a stay in hospital .

merely comfortable . here 's hanna with our refreshments . can you get the door ?

but before i retired , you might say i had a brief time in the sun . fame , as it were . tell me , do you like motion pictures ?

they 're just copies then . gotcha .

you know what they say . if you have to ask --

these are your paintings ?

splendid .

i stink to high heaven right now .

just got away from me . sorry to disturb you .

yeah . i better get on with my work .

boone . clayton boone .

nice place .

good morning .

ooooh .

boone ! you awake ? eight o'clock .

she took the night off . heavy date . some guy she 's had her eye on for a while .

jimmy , there are people here i need to speak to . you 'll be fine on your own ?

i did n't ask george to invite you .

no . i never could . you must regret having had the invitation sent .

you did n't , jimmy .

what are you doing here ?

by the way , i like the renoir .

you remember how a production eats up one 's life .

`` the fault , dear david , is not in ourselves but in our stars . ''

then take the pills .

but the rest of it ? the killing headaches . the phantom smells . my inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once . it 's all nothing more than bad electricity ?

the central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations . whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism . parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random .

my line nowadays runs to rin tin tin . dogs are so much more dependable than men .

oh no , my dear . you look absolutely amazing . there 's no way i can compete with you . the scene is yours .

good-bye . so nice to see you ...

is that boris ? our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion .

but you appear quite fresh , my dear .

and you said there 'd be some of me left . nobody 's going to know me in this getup .

boris ? do i look a fright ?

uh-oh . the way you look at me , james . what have you done this time ?

it must be up in your old room . i will look .

who was that at the door ?

i 'll be fine , hanna . thank you .

do n't be silly , hanna . he 's a very proper actor . and the dullest fellow imaginable .

he looks plenty big . you wo n't need my help if anything goes flooey .

yes , yes , yes . i merely invited mr. boone in for a glass of tea . we 'll have a brief chat and he 'll finish the yard .

you remember what the doctor tells us .

no . let me lie here . thank you .

oh shut up . all we did was talk . my attack had nothing to do with him .

luminal .

mr. kay , sir .

yes , mr. jimmy . an interview . after so many years . very exciting .

do n't think that , mr. whale . i love your movies . that 's why i wanted you to come to this . so i could see you with your monsters .

you , mr. kay ? how do you know george cukor ?

my idea . muchly . my sketches . big heavy brow . head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new , like tinned beef .

universal wanted me for another story , and wanted me so baldly -- i mean badly , not baldly . i was given the pick of stories being developed , and i picked that one .

do n't be shy . there 's time to stop before you go too far .

you must understand how hollywood was twenty years ago . nobody cared a tinker 's cuss who slept with whom , so long as you kept it out of the papers . outside of hollywood , who knows who george cukor is , much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along santa monica ?

that you were forced to retire because , uh -- a sex scandal .

that 's funny , mr. whale .

let 's make it more interesting . i will answer any question you ask . but , for each answer , you must remove one article of clothing .

i am not dead yet , mr. kay .

am i correct in assuming , mr. kay , that it 's not me you 're interested in , only my horror pictures ?

that 's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours . `` bride of frankenstein . ''

ding dong the witch is dead , right ?

are you crazy ? you throw down with the carpenter ? you got a grudge against your life ?

jesus , man ... what 'd you do ?

the point is : kip 's been living the life . only he 's a wild child . crazy . makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time . but he fungold this one so bad , folks around l.b . are already speakin ' about him in the past tense .

it seems she neglected to mention it

about your brother . and the deeeep shit he 's in --

only hurts when i breathe . lookit you . where are barney fife and aunt bea hanging out ? and opie ... where 's opie at ?

what do you mean -- ?

well , that certainly wo n't do .

but i had to . it was the only way to get to you --

get out --

get out of here , ray --

`` do n't want '' the dodgers to lose or the summer to end . but we do n't get to choose these things ...

i 'm just here about my brother .

they just brought in donny astricky . shot by a jacker ...

not my girl anymore

your girl works in there ...

i do n't think so , detective ...

something like that -

i know you .

you 'll leave -- ?

let them go . and i 'll leave ...

leg 's all banged-up . he made a stupid play ... he 'll limp around the yard up at folsom . but astricky will be there to take care of him . with their priors , they 're looking at a serious bounce --

you know my back -

`` over -- '' you know - i can maybe understand , since i been gone , you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime , and for that i can partly blame myself . but what is baffling to me , is how , since i been gone , you 've become a complete and total moron --

hello , otto ...

she soars -

so she flies -

all the vehicles get code names . female names . you say `` eleanor lives at such and such ... `` and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...

this eleanor 's been living at the international towers for 3 years now .

how old are you now , toby ?

not really --

there 's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... you know what you got ta do -- ?

you know what you got here ?

why do n't you leave him alone ?

why you got ta front me like that ? i 'm talking to kip --

what do you want , shithead ?

but he was always a bad kid , that one .

you remember tommy 's shines ? the kid was great . he made mirrors .

you thought i was some fucking jerk ?

but , paulie , i 'm sorry . believe me . i was fucking crazy . but i 'm okay now . i can be trusted . i 'm clean now . on my children . believe me ! two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together ...

you think i did n't know what you were doing ?

i understand .

i 'm not going to get fucked like gribbs . he 's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison . i do n't need that . i do n't care who it is . i 'm warning everybody . gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back . that 's not going to happen to me . you understand ?

i do n't want any more of that shit .

no . the other one . the one who disappeared up the block from christie . the one they made a beef on .

no . no . the guy from downtown .

tell him . it 's okay .

they had a warrant . they went through everything . they would have found it . i swear .

who 's gon na do that ?

i told jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money . be wants to know what 's happening . you got ta meet him .

i had everybody working . even our old babysitter .

get packed . we 're getting out of here .

never .

we 've got to help each other .

let her carry this shit inside .

what am i doing ? i 'm in here ! i 'm in jail . i ca n't stop people from coming to see me .

i 've been all over town . i got a call from the bondman . he says they 're going to rescind your bail if you do n't show up and sign in right now . they 're going to take away the house .

what 's the matter with you ? you 're crazy .

i do n't care . something 's going on .

how much ?

are you nuts ? jeannie 's husband went to the can just to get away from her , she 's such a pain in the ass . let me tell you . nobody goes to jail unless they want to , unless they make themselves get caught . they do stuff with the wrong people . they do n't have things organized . you know who goes to jail ? nigger stickup men . that 's who . and they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car .

oh that . do n't worry about that . nobody 's gon na steal it .

what do you do ?

what 're you doing ? what about the car ?

talk ? to you ? after what you did !

she 's screaming on the street and i mean loud , but she looked good . she had these violet eyes . i remember she 's screaming , but mostly i 'm looking at her eyes . they were just like elizabeth taylor 's . that 's what everybody said .

take it easy . we can talk about it .

it 's that rat bastard from pittsburgh . he ratted you all out . he 's been a rat since he got busted in pittsburgh .

i think you got a good shot at beating the case .

who gives a fuck ? tall her he ran away with a broad . what do you care about her .

what 'll i tell fran ?

what 's going on ? what happened to stacks ? is everything okay ?

it 's been six months .

keep 'em coming .

it 's a fait accompli ?

i remember feeling bad about the guy . but i remember feeling that maybe tuddy was right . i knew paulie did n't want anybody dying in the building .

it was the first time i had ever seen anyone shot .

i ca n't make any more deliveries .

tommy , do n't fuck around . put the gun away . tommy !

is it my fault she wo n't go out without her girlfriend ? for chrissake . come on . you do n't even have to stay . jeesuz ! what 's the big deal ?

keep him here . i 'm going for a bag .

it 's okay . i 'll make it up . i promise . just hurry it up a little . okay ?

stay there .

jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk . it felt funny . i started walking down the block , but i noticed the stores were empty .

the third store down .

i got ta talk to him as soon as i can .

jimmy . i do n't know . i got so much else on my mind . i got the kids . we got no money .

he 's okay . they sobered him up .

he 's a grown man . be does n't have to call every five minutes .

you want a partner ?

someday they 'll get what 's coming to them . that 's the only way they 'll stop .

but it is n't right , paulie . that tommy , he 's making trouble for me all over town . i ca n't go here . i ca n't go there .

you think that matters ? you think they give a shit about anything ? the little bastards .

yeah .

fuck you , you fat fuck .

-- yah , restructurin ' the amount of retards they had workin ' for them .

why did n't you yoke him ?

why is it always this ? i owe it to myself ? what if i do n't want to ?

well , i do n't have no trousers on ...

let 's take a walk . ext . chuckie 's street -- day

i guess so .

you were the only sullivan in the phone book .

fuck this , let 's get something to eat ...

jesus .

-- that is n't funny --

will you take a check ?

i do n't think i ... larry ?

-- these circumstances are mitigated . right now . they 're mitigated .

you do n't have to be nervous , will .

somethin 's in my room .

and what do you see ?

-- maker builds `` k '' to the `` n. '' n is three to the k times --

alexander , i know your theory . the boy is updating , he 's strategy stealing ...

please , i 'm a professor here and it 's very important .

no , no . nothing like that . i just need his name . terry i ca n't give you his name unless you have a complaint .

building two .

which one 's your building ?

could you just check , because the young man who works in my building --

bullshit .

sam called me . from tri-tech . he says you start working for them next week .

i was just sayin ' goodbye to sean .

hey , how you doin ' ?

-- you know how fuckin ' easy this is to me ? this is a joke ! and i 'm sorry you ca n't do this . i really am . 'cause if you could i would n't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up .

then do n't set up any more meetings .

will , what happened at the tri-tech meeting ?

i 'm pretty sure it 's right .

i do n't know what it 's called .

oh , for god 's sake , will .

yeah , when do i get my hypnosis ? you guys been talkin ' for twenty minutes .

-- that ? --

what 's that ?

i happen to know so .

i 've spoken with the judge and he 's agreed to release you under my supervision .

hello . gerald lambeau , m.i.t .

what 're you doing ?

oh , i 'm sorry .

excuse me , professor lambeau ?

i did .

how about gerald lambeau ? ever heard of him ?

you 've heard of albert einstein ?

have you heard of jonas salk ?

good to meet you .

you 're pretty quick with those numbers . how about the odds of me buying the first round ?

sounds good .

how about one now ?

i do n't blame you ! it 's not about that ! it 's about the boy ! 'cause he 's a good kid ! and i wo n't see this happen to him -- i wo n't see you make him feel like a failure too !

-- is that what this is about , sean ? the field 's medal ? do you want me to go home and get it for you ? then will you let the boy --

-- i 'm not angry at you --

why do you think he does that , gerry ?

is it gerry ? 'cause i do n't think it 's fine with you . give him time to figure out what he wants .

you see , sean ? that 's exactly not the point . no one remembers that . they --

what do n't i understand ?

that 's great , gerry , that there 's interest -- but i 'm not sure he 's ready for that .

cutting edge mathematics . think tanks . the kind of place where a mind like will 's is given free reign .

i live right around the corner .

gerry ! any trouble finding the place ?

can we do it at my office ?

i need someone with your kind of background .

where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age --

i got your card .

you were missed . how long has it been since we 've seen each other ?

i 've been busy .

well , it seems we 're in the presence of greatness . professor gerald lambeau is a field 's medal winner . combunatorial mathematics . 1986 .

hold up .

how fuckin ' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job ? how hard is it to push a fuckin ' broom ?

let 's hit `` kelly 's . ''

you 're getting defensive ... henry . and hey , cheif -- tell the wife , at least . christ , set her free .

i 'm sure you do . you probably got a real nice house , nice car -- your book 's a best seller .

buddy , two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump .

c'mon , i read your book . i talked to you . it 's just something i know to be true .

do you find it hard to hide the fact that you 're gay ?

i could work the pit maybe , but i could never drive like dale ernhart --

that 's why i love stock-car racin ' . that dale ernhart 's real good .

i 'm gon na travel a little bit , so i do n't know where i 'll be .

yeah , i think so .

i know .

the wrench , why ?

it sure ai n't good .

twenty years of counselling you see a lot of --

what ?

it 's not about that job . i 'm not saying you should work for the government . but , you could do anything you want . and there are people who work their whole lives layin ' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have . what do you want to do ?

not without a heater and some serious smelling salts , no ...

what did you think ?

i just slid my ticket across the table and said `` sorry fellas , i got ta go see about a girl . ''

what happened to that guy from kentucky ?

i did n't write anything else 'cause nobody , including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one .

i gave that up when my wife got sick .

no , i do n't .

my wife 's dead .

i do n't know .

yeah ? you got a lady now ?

you 've never been out of boston .

why thank you .

maybe you should be a patient and sit down .

this is a real piece of shit .

yes , i do .

whatever blows your hair back .

i did .

i never cared about that .

i just wanted to call before you left . i 'm takin ' all these job interviews . so i wo n't just be a construction worker .

what , you want to come in here and save me ? is that what you want to do ? do i have a sign that says `` save me '' on my back ?

oh , is that what this is about ? you want to hear that i do n't really have any brothers ? that i 'm a fuckin ' orphan ? is that what you want to hear ?

-- some prick from stanford that your parents will approve of . then you 'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin ' too .

why wo n't you come with me ? what are you so scared of ?

then what are you afraid of ?

look , will if you 're not in love with me , you can say that .

one , because i have a job here and two because i live here --

'cause that 's a serious thing you 're sayin ' . i mean , we might be in california next week and you could find out somethin ' about me that you do n't like . and you might feel like `` hey this is a big mistake . '' but you ca n't take it back , 'cause you know it 's real serious and you ca n't take somethin ' like that back . now i 'm in california , 'cause you asked me to come . but you do n't really want me there . and i 'm stuck in california with someone who really does n't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back .

and you 're sure about that ?

yeah , but how do you know ?

come with me to california .

-- but you can do my o-chem lab in under an hour , you can --

i guess so .

all right , mr. nosey parker . let me ask you a question ? do you have a photographic memory ?

clearly .

i thought you said you 'd show me your place .

i think i can make it to south boston .

what about your friends ? or your brothers ? when do i get to meet them ?

why do we always stay here ?

i 'm supposed to understand this .

did n't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth ?

if you bring the caramels .

well ...

i swear to god .

bullshit .

yeah .

pretty boring , i guess .

i was kinda ' hopin ' to get a `` good night laid '' but ... i 'll take a kiss .

yes you have . you were thinking you were gon na get a good night kiss .

you know what i mean . i know you 've at least thought about it .

have you ever seen annie hall ?

so you just want to use me and go ?

i do n't know , it was just kind of the boring suburban thing . private school , harvard , and now med . school . i actually figured out that at the end of it , my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars . i should n't have told you that ...

you are n't , by any chance , pre-law ? are you ?

okay , sounds good .

here 's my number .

i did n't mean you . listen , maybe ...

what ?

sure ! i was just aimin ' to meet up with a couple girls i know .

i never knowed they was anything like her !

lissen . i do n't care nothin ' about you , but if you mess in this , your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble , an ' tom get sent back to the penitentiary .

well , i do n't know what you gon na do about it , because i do n't hear no riot an ' i do n't see no riot , an ' what 's more i do n't believe they *is* no riot . look for yourself .

goodnight .

say , who runs this place ?

you got dances too ?

camp site costs a dollar a week , but you can work it out , carrying garbage , keeping the camp clean -- stuff like that .

well -- tell the folks inside how it is , tom . tell 'em they 're starvin ' us and stabbin ' theirself in the back . an ' as sure as god made little apples it 's goin ' back to two an ' a half jus ' as soon as they clear us out .

thought you was in jail .

hide in the willows . if it 's awright to come back i 'll give you four high whistles .

you 're right !

if she does it 'll be a miracle outa scripture .

what you figger to do ?

she 's settlin ' .

they never wrote you nothing ?

and you ai n't ashamed ?

did n't you hear ? it was in the papers .

at my meetin 's i used to get the girls glory-shoutin ' till they about passed out . then , i 'd go to comfort 'em -- and always end up by lovin ' 'em . i 'd feel bad , an ' pray , an ' pray , but it did n't do no good . next time , do it again . i figgered there just was n't no hope for me .

*used* to be . not no more . i lost the call . but boy , i sure *used* to have it ! i 'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin ' full of repented sinners i pretty near *drowned* half of 'em ! but not no more . i lost the sperit .

well , i do declare ! i baptized you , son .

sometimes . a little . only it ai n't scairt so much . it 's just waitin ' an ' wonderin ' . but when sump ' n happens that i got to do sump ' n -- -- i 'll do it .

to make a long story short ...

insane .

that 's a tragedy . can i finish my story please ? i began my search for meaning . i was a catholic , jew , scientologist , sufi , buddhist . i went to a psychologist , psychiatrist , herbalist , nutritionist , a shaman , and a psychic . and they all pretty much say the same stuff .

it seemed like my life was slipping away , somehow . i was a knot in the middle of a wet rope . everything was futile and nothing had value .

he gets this way when he hits over eighty-five .

yes .

you open 'em up and there 's the sayings , stories , little bites of insight . it 's the p.p.p . six day week .

i 'm staying here .

you 're a government spook ?

is it something you 've done ?

not the other way around ... ?

he was trying to kill you , right !

could be . the physical substance of love .

like heroin ?

we have n't seen each other since high school .

i 'll just help myself to a cocktail .

seven it is .

it 's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever .

uh , no . so you 're back now , a decade later , and you want to sort things out with me . the question now is , do i allow you ... access ... to my being ?

ohhh . you 're in therapy too , marty ?

-- and i guess , sure , seeing you would be part of that whole equation ... i suppose the most important thing , really . i do n't know . anyway , this whole thing 's my therapist 's idea . it 's my shrink , really .

professional killer . do you get dental with that ?

i 'm a professional killer .

since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word ?

how long has it been ?

take a deep breath and realize , that this is me breathing .

what else ? say more .

if i get antsy i 'll kill a few small animals .

so you 're saying that ulysses -- everything he said to his queen when he came back -- everything was a lie ? he just wanted to fuck around ?

we 're both professionals , oatman .

why not . i trust you . you could n't turn me in because of doctor-patient privilege ... and i do n't want to be `` withholding '' ... and i know where you live .

i just know .

tell me about your vision of the reunion .

you went to school with these people .

why do n't you want to go to your high school reunion ?

okay .

i been looking at you , and i 've decided that i want to share something with you .

i do . some guys ca n't adjust to it ; they ca n't handle it .

excellent . here they come .

okay .

... how about i sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece ?

fine . but we 're not going to let you do your job . because we 're gon na do it . and then , after we do your job , we 're gon na do another little job ...

no deal .

but since we 're both here , i think it 's time to take a fresh look at our relationship .

a little misunderstanding among my associates .

and you could be ... sort of like ... a father figure to me ... .

thank you , no .

those all seem kind of related ...

good . for a second there i thought we were in trouble .

i get it .

looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us .

one can not love and kill .

he using her .

-look . you want to kill a good guy , but not be a bad guy , you wait until a bad guy kills the good guy , and then you come in and kill the bad guy , and then you 're the good guy .

we ca n't do our job unless he does his job .

that 's strictly bader-meinhof stuff .

-- yes . and the munich olympics in '72 . a local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened .

in portugal , yes .

will do .

i 'll call them and tell them you 're taking your time . being a professional .

i 'll do it tomorrow .

this is not good .

paperwork on the detroit thing . it 's a full dossier . very comprehensive .

would you describe their position as inflexible ?

tell them that 's impossible . i need my normal lead time .

they blame you for the compromise .

yeah ...

i ca n't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given i left and never said goodbye to her .

of course you will .

it 's good to see you . i 'm sure you 're curious about what i 've been doing .

marlin perkins and jim !

what 's a revival tent ?

work 's good for the soul .

i have to get my head back into my work .

it did n't work out .

as long as you had a good time .

i was catching up with bob destephano .

what the hell happened to you ?

how could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully ?

thank you .

ten years . what happened ! ?

no . you drove us here .

kind of crept up on you , did n't it ?

you too .

god it 's great to see you .

you 're leaving me hanging here ...

well , a 'course , taxes provide your basic service -- police and whatnot . but our customers need a little more than just that , you understand ? this badge does n't mean that i am a peace officer .

i took the other road . i 'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation . i love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone . and you ?

martin , i do n't know where you 've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago , and i do n't care . it was good that you left , and i 'm glad you did . so what do you want to talk about ? you 've grown up a bit . maybe i had you figured wrong .

good evening , mr. blank .

good evening , mr. newberry .

the point was to love each other .

why ?

i figured , whenever you decided to go , you 'd be all set .

summers are short here , annie . there is n't much of a fall . before you know it , the roads are closed ... the nights get long .

ssshhh ... stand still , annie . takes what we 've got , just for now . can you do that ?

oh , god , what are we going to do ? i 'm supposed to --

what ? !

this is mr. booker , robert .

yeah , i think it is . and i do n't mean everybody 's got to be married , have kids -- it 's more like , knowing where you 're from , where you belong , what feeds you , where you can go no matter what happens ... knowing what you 're supposed to be doing while you 're here .

why did n't it work out ?

how did you meet her ?

yeah . i have n't seen him in a while . he used to come to the ranch over summers , but then he started having friends and was going off to college , so ... good boy . hal . lives in new york near his mom .

how long did you live here with your wife ?

ok .

yeah .

feel good ?

no , ma'am , i 'm afraid that 's extra .

poor thing .

you have n't heard the question yet . truth is , you 'd be doing me a favor . i got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old rimrock here is feeling kind of left out ...

oh yes . i forgot .

i thought you were an editor , not a reporter ?

i found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts .

i once heard itzhak perlman guest star with the chicago symphony orchestra . he played rachmaninov 's vocalize opus 34. no . 14. it was one of the most beautiful pieces of music i ever heard . i actually forgot where i was for a time . you seem surprised ?

you were married to a woman in chicago ?

does chicago count ?

ha ... if you 've never lived in a city with museums , theater , music , restaurants , uh ... god , a million things , then it 's something i ca n't explain .

that 's your cue to say you 're not laughing at me .

do n't be so sure it 's my last . there are a few people back home i 'd like to put under a red hot iron .

you okay ?

you know , we 're branding here tomorrow . if you two want to come by to watch or give a hand , you 're welcome .

you can make it as complicated or as easy as you like . but she 's the one who 's gon na be riding him , am i right ? so here 's the deal . i 'm not sure i can do anything , but i 'm prepared to give it a go -- -- if you 'll help . you have a problem with that ?

well , that 'll be a little complicated --

grace ? ... grace , you want to come with us , take a look at pilgrim ?

does n't matter .

were you thinking of personally driving me back east ?

plenty of signs -- just none of them printed . who do i get the idea you 're not just passing through !

mr. booker , if i could just ex --

great !

hi .

smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in sheriden . he wo n't be back for three days . i ca n't believe he did n't want to say goodbye .

why should they ?

that 's not true .

stop it ! why ca n't i talk to you ! !

i was just trying to say thank you to diane and frank and --

... you worried everything all right now and we 'll have to go home ?

did you go riding ?

thanks , honey .

you 're right . good .

i 'll come .

we 'll have more room because we 're moving onto the ranch . they have this empty house near this creek . it 's actually pretty ... ok ... i love you . dad wants to talk to you .

little .

that 's not true !

who do you think i 'm doing this for ? i 'm doing this for you !

you were never thirteen , mom .

i did n't know i had to .

oh . you did n't tell me .

i already did . this morning . when you went running .

-- enough time tomorrow . i know .

you want to take your bath ? we have to get up early tomorrow . you may not have enough time to --

what ?

maybe they should put me down too .

no , you did n't .

oh , honey ... what happened ?

i ca n't even get out of bed yet ! you 're already putting me in therapy ! !

yes . we 're suing .

did you speak to farlow ?

may i have a suggestion ?

you were right about coming here . i 'm sorry for not thinking ...

you 're allergic to hay .

well , uh the real reason i called , actually , was to tell you i saw lucy at jo-jo 's tonight and she seems very worried .

i wish i did .

fine . actually , today was a good day . you should have seen her .

huh-huh . you ?

everything all right .

oh , robert , i 'm sorry . we were so tired from the branding . grace barely made it to her bed and i did n't have the energy to take my clothes off .

yeah , but nothing i ca n't handle . lucy tells me she thinks gottchalks 's plotting , but what else is new .

so , how are you doing in marlboro country ? is the magazine complaining at all ?

yeah . she seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch , which is why i said yes to this move . but , whenever it 's just the two of us , i do n't know ... anyway ... what 's happening with the delco lawsuit ?

what if she does n't want to go ?

i really wish i could understand why you think this is so necessary .

her psychiatrist ... said ... she needs security now ... stability ...

why ? !

what ... bo- ... what about the magazine ?

he did , but ... i think i can change his mind .

yeah .

they 're still our friends , annie . it 's nothing serious . you kid about them all the time ... and i could tell paul really appreciated me being there .

do you ? do you really ?

you can hardly get your arms around me . how depressing . you 're so early .

`` ... fresh , wind in her hair ... life without care ... she 's broke ... but it 's 'ok ' ...

we 're very lucky .

she was in pretty bad shape . they 've done a c.a.t . scan -- she has some hemorrhaging ...

okay . we 'll see you later then .

riding with judith .

i should be in by two .

so , what , uh , what train are you taking ?

it 's me .

we have a business manager . the best around .

well , get born a bull , got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger . on a balance i reckon i 'd choose being a cow . would you mind passing that salad young lady ?

good luck to you , annie .

no , no , i 'll go -- just give me a list .

well , i am going to go after lunch .

annie , i 'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let 's just say what it is . when you first came here , i did n't like you and i was worried . tom means a lot to me and this family . do n't go looking here for whatever you looking for . do n't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time .

they do n't come better . but i do n't deny there are times i wonder about things i wo n't have . maybe one day i 'll get to see egypt . maybe not . but i know if you try too many different lives , you can wind up with no life at all ...

did you always know this was the life you wanted ?

you and frank ever take a vacation ?

oh , god -- i think it was the fourth or fifth time i 'd been there , so all i remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was ...

what was it like ?

i was there for that shot , actually .

ha , she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old , he ran off . they found him in the barn , sleeping between two giant hooves of a percheron stallion . she said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise .

mrs. maclean -- why do n't you and daughter stay for dinner ?

annie , no matter what i do , this horse will never be the same .

her leg was shattered so they had to , uh ... remove it . she had some bleeding but it 's under control .

diane !

they 're already all settled in , frank . anyway , i 'm sure annie wants her privacy .

no thanks .

ha ...

what , they ai n't going forty miles into choteau everytime they want a hamburger .

we should be fine , then .

bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle .

you know her ?

i would n't let happen .

i do n't thinks you 'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody .

i do n't know ... you sure tom said it 's all right ?

i want to watch .

i ca n't ... not yet ...

not a question of if you can -- you are . just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself .

i do n't have all day .

i ca n't ...

drive ? i 'm not old enough yet .

probably . she 's on the phone twenty- three hours a day .

yeah ?

why do n't we just cut through the woods ?

can i come ? i 'll start a fire ...

i did . he said he had work to do until late .

what , sweetheart ?

honey , you all right ? did something fall ?

ya just had a turn . it was not .

well , like i told your wife , it 's really up to pilgrim .

i ca n't believe it 's the same horse .

hi . it 's a pleasure . i 'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here . i bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere .

what are you looking at , young man ?

oh i clear forget . you had a call from some woman in new york . she sounded pretty wound up .

oh-oh ... maybe i better get back in the truck .

kind of trouble i 'm in the mood for .

hey , rona . sorry i 'm late .

hey , darlin ' .

what do you mean ?

it 's cool !

cool ?

in english , please . i did n't spend ten years protecting the president so i could finish my career feeling like an idiot .

hackers of the world , unite !

that 's it ! an electronic army ! if i were us , i 'd get on the internet , send out a major distress signal .

someone broke into the hardware store . probably kids .

hi , annie , laurie ...

i do n't know yet . i have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating .

old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows . his parents grounded him for the weekend . he ca n't come over tonight .

we just talked .

he went out drinking beer with mike godfrey and he wo n't be back until late . you 'll have to call him tomorrow . besides , i 'm on my way to pick up paul .

yes , you can .

you 'll have to . he 's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up .

i 'd say you must have the wrong number .

for that matter , i might as well be a girl scout tonight . i plan on making popcorn and watching doctor dementia . six straight hours of horror movies . little lindsey wallace wo n't know what hit her .

i always said you 'd make a fabulous girl scout .

probably mister riddle .

lies .

bye .

now you hear obscene chewing . you 're losing it , laurie .

why did n't you say anything ? you scared me to death .

of course .

hello ?

it 's tragic . you never go out . you must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much .

poor laurie . you scared another one away .

subtle , is n't he ? hey creep !

that man who drove by so fast , the one you yelled at .

i have a place for that .

exploring uncharted territory ?

annie , paul 's on the phone !

yeah ?

go get me a beer .

want a beer ?

yeah .

i ca n't help it . it just keeps ringing .

totally ...

... then you rip my clothes off . then we rip lyndsey 's clothes off . i think i 've got it .

you idiot !

now ... first we 'll talk a little , then annie will distract lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left . got it ?

will you call me tomorrow ?

i got ta go .

i found the car ! he 's here !

i watched him for fifteen years , sitting in a room staring at a wall , not seeing the wall , seeing past it , seeing this night . he 's waited for it , inhumanly patient . hour after hour , day after day , waiting for some silent , invisible alarm to trigger him . death has arrived in your little town , sheriff . you can ignore it , or you can help me stop it .

jesus !

if you do they 'll be seeing him everywhere , on every street corner , in every house . just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes .

looks like to me you 're just plain scared .

could have ...

come on ... a skunk could have killed it ...

i 'll be here .

i 'd like to talk to you , if i could .

the only reason she babysits is to have a place to ...

it 's your own fault and i do n't feel sorry for you .

how ?

was it the bogyman ?

hurry !

be quiet ! get lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door !

tommy , stop it ! you 're scaring lindsey .

i promise .

the bogyman !

there was no one outside .

laurie ...

laurie , what 's the boogey man ?

not any more .

sure . sure .

listen to me . i want you to walk down the street to the mackensie 's and knock on their door . you tell them to call the police and send them over here . do you understand ?

now , i want you to walk to the door , down the stairs and right out the front door .

let 's make more popcorn .

well , go tell her it 's me , okay ?

yes , she is .

hello .

sam , haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here . how could he get there ? he ca n't drive .

probably going .

you do n't have anything to worry about . he has n't spoken a word in 15 years .

he 'll barely be able to sit up .

i love that . that 's my type .

he 's the -- he looks like ichabod crane ?

mm-mm !

uh , who gets dropped first ?

look at this .

yeah .

wha -- what kind of things do you build ?

hi .

and the quail is responsible for the quail eggs .

well , i-i-i did n't know what to say . first i said no , but then , he pressed it . he said , uh , he 'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me .

you 're joking .

oh , uh , listen , david called me up .

i 'm telling you , you sounded great . you , uh , you may be surprised .

uh ...

... a monstrosity ! who would do that ?

that 's disgusting !

it 's almost ... almost , uhhh , entirely wholly interdependent , if you know what i mean . i-i ... i ca n't put it into words . the important thing is-is-is it-it breathes .

right .

i know . it 's terrible !

okay , norman , listen , i really want to talk about this at home . i think it 's a matter for your analyst ... and mine .

i gave blood before and , uh ... clothing to the poor .

right .

oh , that was a wonderful show . i think that 's the best show you two ever wrote .

yes .

it does .

and it ruins everything else .

yes .

it 's terrific !

what time do you get off ?

is this your first job ?

listen , you guys are too attractive to be caterers . something 's wrong .

only a few . a few . do you like 'em ?

you know , there 's no reason for panic . i just want to rule out some things .

i always , i-i always imagine that i have things .

no , i-i 've been perfectly healthy . you know me .

have you been exposed to a loud noise recently , or did you have a virus ?

so what 's the , uh , problem this time ?

it 's not that big a deal . we just did n't hit it off .

yeah . it 's kind of a weird place , actually . a lotta wall space .

dusty 's just bought a huge house in southampton and he 's in the process of decorating it .

well , are ... are they big ?

frederick 's done this whole new series that i 'm sure you would really love .

we --

yes , but you name names .

... with the affiliates .

and you 're in love overnight ?

yeah , but we-we made so many plans .

uh ... i-i-i know . i deserve this .

yes , she 's , she 's very warm , but , but it-it 's me that wants to be giving to you . i-i-i want to do things for you . hannah does n't need me as much . i 'm being presumptuous . not that you need me .

i do n't want anyone else ever to have you .

i know it is n't .

i promised myself i would n't let this happen till you were living alone . i was so torn when you called .

i-i could n't think where to invite you without taking risks .

lee ... uh ...

your guilt is because you feel the same .

poor hannah .

oh , i ca n't be the cause of anything between you and hannah . i jus --

not because of me , i hope .

what are you doing ? !

yes , it made me cry it was so beautiful ... so romantic .

did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve ?

they have a very large gay clientele , you know , where i get my teeth cleaned , and ... all the hygienists now wear gloves because they 're afraid of aids .

oh , and holly met a wonderful man who loves opera . an architect .

oh , yeah , that 's really nice of you .

and , uh , d-do n't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve . it reminded me of you .

uh , uh , this is great . i mean , i love e.e . cummings , but i ca n't let you get this .

oh , oh , yes . i-i-i- 'd like to , uh , uh , very much .

e.e . cummings . i 'd like to get you this .

everything 's okay ?

you seem tense . is everything all right ? you feel okay ?

yeah , you would .

i think to myself what problems could she possibly have ?

i 'll never understand it . you 're so bright and charming and beautiful .

yes , i do .

oh , yes ! you live near here , do n't you ?

ohhhh !

you 're out looking here ?

what are you doing here ?

oh , elliot !

really ? so , so , what else ? wh- what are you up to ?

oh , well , you know frederick . one of his moods . although it was n't a bad week . he uh , sold a picture .

you 're not lost .

it 's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return !

you matter to me . completely .

leave me alone , can you ? !

have you been talking to holly or lee about us ? about our-our personal life ?

are you ?

but what do , what do you -- what 's that mean ? w-w-we 've been , we 've been married for four years . how settled can things get ?

where 're you going ?

holly and april , thanks for helping .

she has all the cooking talent .

are n't they great ?

have you tried these ? these are wonderful . holly and her friend made them .

and we drink to her , and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year ... her great success in a doll 's house !

get his wine away .

mom , come out !

of what ? i 'll be unconscious .

that thought does n't terrify you ?

so ?

so , just 'cause i was born that way ... you know , i 'm old enough to make a mature decision .

oh ...

oh , god , that 's too much responsibility for me . it 's not fair ! i want a less complicated life , frederick . i want a husband , maybe even a child before it 's too late .

you are , you are my only connection to the world !

what 's the difference ? ! it 's just somebody i met !

but you , god , you knew that was going to happen sooner or later . i ca n't live like this !

i 'm sorry .

what are you going to use for money ? !

i 'm just trying to complete an education i started on you five years ago .

you missed a very dull tv show about auschwitz . more gruesome film clips ... and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions .

oh , no , no , no . he 's my sister 's husband . and i think if you gave him half a chance , you 'd like him . he 's very intelligent .

because he likes you .

mmm ...

you 're not going to abuse them . they 're all so sweet .

are you sure ?

yes !

a week ago , i bought a rifle .

can i tell you something ? can i tell you a secret ?

yeah ... but you 're not dying !

naturally , i , i -- do you know i -- the sudden appearance of a black spot on my back !

oh , god ! do you hear a buzzing ? is there a buzzing ?

oh , jesus !

in-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch , why do n't we repeat the cardinal spellman ronald reagan homosexual dance number ?

yeah ?

i'm-i 'm okay . yeah , i-i-i , you know , i ... i 'm just , um , i got dizzy all of a sudden . i'm-i 'm ... i have a headache .

i 've been trying to talk to him about it . he says everything 's fine , but i do n't know . automatically , you know , i leap to the worst conclusions .

oh , hannah , she's-she 's just embarrassed in front of you , that 's all .

... 'cause every time i try to be helpful , you know , sh-she gets so defensive .

why ?

i hope you tell her it was your idea ...

he was , he 's just as crazy as ever . he was on his way to get a blood test .

aah ... hey , have you tried holly and her friend 's shrimp puffs ?

right . we felt that if we were gon na do it , that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and ...

just think about it . that 's all i ask .

you know , where i-i-i would get implanted from a-a donor .

well , what about artificial insemination ?

gee .

go right over there .

i like him . i think he 's a sweet guy .

really ? that 'll be terrific for him , i think .

oh !

yeah ?

i got ta see new comedians later , i 've got ta --

he 's the one that 's made every ingenue in stock !

... from mavis , also .

hey !

no , he has n't . if i offended you , i 'm sorry .

i do n't see how you could know about these things unless elliot 's been talking to you .

wow , i guess i hit a nerve .

can i , can i not accept gestures and feelings from people ? do i , do i put people off ?

my script ?

what 's the matter ?

yeah , that 's clerical .

well , that-that 's good . it just , uh ... it just seems to me that-that six months or a year , if-if you spent it more productively ...

well , that ... th-that 's fine .

oh , what do they know ?

hey , hi !

tch , well , i sing ! for chrissake , hannah , you heard me sing !

... every , eh , single rejection as- as-as a ... a confirmation that you have no talent , or something ?

yeah .

w-why ? you do n't think it 's realistic ?

uh-huh .

uh , you know , i think i can fake my way through a song .

you know .

oh-oh . holly ... and his wife 's , uh , in and out of institutions . she 's schizophrenic .

maybe at christmas , new year 's . if not this new year 's , maybe next new year 's .

here . be careful with those .

not this thanksgiving , you know .

oh , he 's such a loser !

oh , your kids are so adorable .

when does frederick ever come with her ?

maybe when she 's eighty , she 'll stop straightening her garter belt when there 's a guy around .

are we talking about cocaine again ?

will you just tell me one thing ?

two thousand dollars .

no , no , we decided !

mickey ?

now do n't get nervous . it 's just your husband .

yeah .

do you ? i mean , are you , are you , are you , are you free this evening ?

gosh , you really went through a crisis , you know that ? h-how did you get over it ? i mean , when i ran into you , you seemed , you seemed just perfectly fine . well , you seem fine now .

y-you used to -- oh , no ! yeah , i care . you used to be so ambitious and ... god , you really liked it ? !

fabulous , i mean it ! i 'm so impressed .

right .

oh , it just came to me one day .

you must be joking . i 've been doing all my own reading since i was forty ... you know .

so , uh ... i threw it out , but i have this other one .

i 'm -- yes . yes , i 'm fine . i 'm fine . how are you ?

i have n't . no , the reason why i ask is i think it might make a great , uh , television script , and , you know , you 're so active in television , so --

you 've always hated my taste in the past .

no , i am . i am .

come on .

yeah .

yeah ? is that an embarrassing question ? should i have not asked it ?

you did n't answer my question . what are you doing ?

... namely a personality .

well , i hope you 've changed .

you look wonderful .

i 'm fine .

yeah .

i was walking past and i saw you in here ...

... i had a great time tonight , really . it was like the nuremberg trials .

jesus ... i 'm glad hannah got us together . you know , she 's got a great instinct for people . really .

this crowd would n't know the difference ! they 're embalmed !

at least i 'm open to new concepts !

yeah , that 's tough ! you do n't deserve cole porter . you should stay with those groups that look like they 're gon na stab their mother !

now come on , you 're be -- , 'cause you 're being angry at me .

oh , well , i can not communicate with you ! i , you know , i never realized you were such a tightass . mickey i ca n't understand you . your sisters , both sisters have such good taste in music . i do n't know where you went , went wrong .

you want some ?

listen , you are witnessing genius !

oh , why are you making those faces ?

why are you so upset ?

boy ... holly ... holly .

yeah , okay , right . forget it . what 's to eat ?

oh ...

god .

yeah , well , what 's your religion ?

what makes you interested in becoming a hare krishna ?

i < u > swear < /u > to you ...

... i was < u > working < /u > ...

< u > what < /u > is this , a whorehouse , or are you my < u > wife < /u > ?

oh , yes . he 's found peace .

you want me to be ?

... are n't you afraid of me ... ?

... why ?

waal , because your < u > selling < /u > 'em ... two years ago , his annotated dictionary of cuisine , by alexander dumas , went for sixteen thousand dollars . seller 's affidavit of ownership , signed cary panz . p.a.n.z . sounds to me like an orderly . whadja clear on the book ? ten , twelve grand ?

why me ?

and i 'd like your help , determining who 's bidding for their purchase .

we got a bunch of < u > materials < /u > , coming up at auction . materials which disappeared from dr. lechter 's cell , drawings he made , his < u > books < /u > .

i 'm struck by your phraseology . i did not < u > last < /u > with him . i was privileged to enjoy his company during that time .

what have they got you doing ?

... how are things at the hospital ?

or , perhaps ...

... what < u > hindered < /u > you ... ?

if you 'll come down the street i will make you a cup of coffee .

you know why that is ? because there are so few things i need to forget . would you agree , for the record , that i have not been read my rights ?

i know her by the back .

brigham . go . affirmative . okay , happiness is a green light . we 've got evelda in the kitchen , cooking . the dope 's d.e.a . < u > we < /u > want her on interstate transportation of some firecrackers . starling : you 've got drumgo , you know her from before .

hard up as you are , at your age ? whadda < u > you < /u > care ? surrender .

... the whole world 's out to get you ...

could i get a < u > drink < /u > , n ' i do n't < u > care < /u > , you see , what all they got me doin , for i 'd rather be doin ' < u > makework < /u > , than be doin ' < u > pub ' l'relations < /u > with the dirty dozen , one < u > hispanic < /u > , one < u > librarian < /u > , one < u > jew < /u > , and one from column a , and one from column ... thank you .

bad beat today .

he had nothing . he lived in a garret . his work was his life , he ...

... he was < u > wealthy < /u > ...

impossible .

they got that kind of money ?

doctore carlo fanelli , curator of the pallazo capponi , 2 months missing .

good evening , dr. lechter . thank you for coming . i am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances .

... sir ... ?

somewhere in italy .

can we identify it as dr. lechter ?

yes , but we know who it was , and i will tell you , agent starling , what you know to be true . i offered the bounty . it was illegal , and , worse , it was < u > wrong < /u > . and i thank god every day that i did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder . do you agent starling : do you know < u > god < /u > ?

the identity of the person offering the bounty was never established .

... mr. verger would be pleased to make a contribution , to the charitable ...

... .i hardly < u > think < /u > so ... after `` the incident '' ...

he is ... ?

the children ... ?

'fraid it 's too late .

... young boys , still ... ?

am i on that case , sir ... ?

why would you say that ? because he sent me in there to be killed ... ? what < u > is < /u > this ... ?

what , you 're saying she was overwrought .

well , you know , that happens , on the street .

and how did she get close enough to disarm you ?

i think that 's ... { he starts to rise , and the meeting begins to break up ) starling , i 'm sure these gentlemen ...

just a moment . starling did n't ...

give it up .

i said how 's your baby ... ?

waited too long , hon ... ?

what 'd you say , hon ... ?

i 'm an orphan .

gon na be fine . you ask your momma .

evone tells me : i shoulda been in , fi , six , months ago ... . thizz my first checkup .

my mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men .

yes , i think i amused them . to what do i owe ... ?

if such there breathe , i 'm sure you could < u > unearth < /u > him ... your reputation does you honor .

darling ...

i < u > sense < /u > ... the faintest < u > whiff < /u > of a perfume , whose < u > base < /u > , whose < u > base < /u > , whose < u > base < /u > is `` hamamelis '' ... it is < u > witch-hazel < /u > -- such a clean scent . no , not a european scent . i would say it is a scent of the new world . i would say , you have been in america . have i struck home ?

how could you know ?

i wonder no longer . you were out of the country .

carpal-tunnel syndrome . from a life of typing . commendatore . < u > history < /u > , a hazardous profession .

you assemble this , on the instant , from these few observations ?

if your duty requires it .

of course , < u > in < /u > his offices , if you come across anything , any personal papers of his , anything , however trivial , would you contact me , please ... are his personal effects still at the palazzo ?

... yes .

i know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a < u > note < /u > , a farewell note , a suicide note ...

we got kittykat ...

no .

... tell them ...

they < u > will < /u > , sir . we < u > train < /u > them , to the figurine , < u > eventually < /u > , they consume a man , say , 80 kilos , say , in ...

you were given backup ... .

sir , i 'm in law enforcement , i was out there , dealing with an armed and dangerous ...

he saw the truth , and < u > spoke < /u > it ...

i 'm going to cut you loose . with all due respect , doctor , if you fuck with me , i 'll shoot you dead , do you understand ... ? do right and you 'll live through this .

... what has she done to harm you ... ?

you do n't wish to < u > beg < /u > ... ?

give me your gun ...

trouble is , they all seem to < u > die < /u > .

no .

what was it . what was it , honey ?

i met a man , and his troubles were greater than mine ...

you stay offa this alphabet soup detail , all this half-baked , cowboy stuff , till after you get your < u > mind < /u > cleared ... . you do n't wan na go out there a half-step < u > slow < /u > ...

i am no going to show you the < u > secret < /u > < u > handshake < /u > !

show 'm the fbi < u > hand < /u > shake ...

look what they put her on ...

oh baby , oh baby ... .

well . < u > excellent < /u > ... i 'm ...

i want the < u > same < /u > drink . cause it did me < u > good < /u > ... but i already drunk it , so , barring that , yes , i would like another .

you want another drink , honey ... ?

then we can not go .

yes , yes , yes , your thirty thousand dollars reward , which you would have to split with your team , which , < u > if < /u > you get it , will not buy me a new < u > watch < /u > ...

i am on the track of ...

... they asked us to dinner . how can we accept if we can not < u > return < /u > the ...

... my love ...

... a case , so , so < u > fascinating < /u > , so ...

i di n't solve it , i did n't ' < u > solve it < /u > ' . i just sat a < u > dance < /u > out with him . facts , facts , facts . < u > facts < /u > , close the case , cavalier .

waal , you c ' n only get it in one shop in alexandria virginia , n'that 's where i 'm going , cause i 'm goin < u > home < /u > , f ' i can get n ' y'one , of that nature , to < u > take < /u > her there ...

but perhaps , there is some , some less radical solution .

... < u > sadly < /u > ...

it would seem .

brazilian .

and what does < u > that < /u > mean ?

but they were not there . < u > yesterday < /u > . is that called a delusion ... ?

and you have been < u > dreaming < /u > ... dreaming about this hat , and ...

and you 've decided to get < u > married < /u > . you 've decided a < u > lot < /u > of things . but , in spite of your decisions -- you are still `` nagged '' by feelings of : < u > despair < /u > , of < u > failure < /u > of ... you still have the < u > nightmare < /u > , you ...

i do n't understand .

yes , but no one is in control of their emotions . that 's all we have time for today ...

welcome to the human race . do you know , there are people who admire you ? reasonable people . why do n't you < u > find < /u > them ... ?

but ... but ... .but ... . you 're < u > right < /u > . i used it . to < u > bargain < /u > . for her < u > sympathy < /u > ... i < u > used < /u > it -- to `` whore myself out '' --

well , no ... that 's ... i appreciate your < u > help < /u > , but ...

... and to have < u > done < /u > it , means , can mean to accept , not only < u > danger < /u > , but < u > betrayal < /u > ... ?

i have not , i would < u > not < /u > . for life life goes on starling . and , wait , wait , i wish to < u > talk < /u > to you ... i 'm ... one moment . i was < u > afflicted < /u > , do you see , but my affliction was not in my meeting with your dr. lechter . i was < u > afflicted < /u > before . before . do you see ? in my arrogance . do not do not curse god when you are humiliated . listen to me : < u > embrace < /u > it , and you embrace < u > life < /u > ... . < u > listen < /u > , and you hear the word of < u > god < /u > ...

large resources , starling , which i prefer to devote elsewhere ... .

and why would you suspect me , of this ghoulishness ?

ah , yes , ah yes . our doctor lechter ... and have they sent you , once again to < u > capture < /u > him ? how terrible for you ...

do n't raise your voice at -- i gave you the ultimate male fantasy -- sex , nothing on the side . do n't pretend we shared anything other than fluids .

it 's funny , when i first met you i thought you were such a weirdo ... i still think you 're a nut , but you 're my nut .

you have no idea . now run away .

did you wait until you were 18 ?

you mean you did n't have any gay thoughts when you were my age ...

andrew . you 're not gay ; you 're ten . you should n't even be having thoughts like ...

i 'm gay . like you did n't know .

summer would have been a lot less without you . you 're a true friend , donald .

i 'm in the picture on wendy 's wall . niagara falls . family trip . little wendy foreground . me background . what are the odds on that one ?

howdy pouty .

make it seem you have this comfortable , mysterious life and you do n't give a shit whether she 's a part of it . oh , and bring up india , talia has this obsession ... whoa , donald , play hard to get , not hard to want ... let talia know that your goofy act is just something you do for the kids ... .

call me conservative , but i 'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine ms. berry 's lovely visage .

there you are ! man , i do n't know how to thank ...

why am i so -- that 's new -- the way i figure it is if i can get through to just one camper ... then i 'm a pretty incompetent counselor . ] do n't get caught . i 'll deny ] everything . ]

it 's about time . is n't fun great ?

goodnight , jasper .

no , they 're not from wendy .

this is not the way it was supposed to -- i was going to start writing a children 's book using input from all -- i do n't even like smoking !

... sorry ...

i 'm sorry . it just ... it seems silly . like kissing a girl .

you look a like you could use a friend . you know , i 'll never forget my first day at camp . boy , i was so nervous that i ...

i just never thought of you in that ...

so what ? ]

this is n't about `` doing it . '' i just think we need to talk some things out privately before ...

she got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide .

when were you in niagara falls ?

talking while kissing .

you know , this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing ...

ann taylor would have paid a lot more , but i would n't trade this experience for the world . sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger -- you think i 'm a big dork do n't you ?

oh you know , bosnia , the importance of the right to vote ...

hey -- that coffee ? you 're a goddess . gim me , gim me ... so what you gals talk about ?

that 's not what i was worried about .

no . fuck no . if you met yourself as a child , would you hug her and say everything 's going to be okay ...

it 's not my style , okay ?

that 's bullshit . just shoot .

you do n't deserve my fucking speech !

how 's my little cheerleader ? now i know everyone at your high school is n't so uptight , come < u > on < /u > .

phil collins ? are you sure he is n't drinking and driving ?

no , not at all . brad you 're pretty enough to be one .

you 're beautiful .

if i got that money , i 'd give it all to the poor . every cent .

hey veronica , how 'd that teenage prevention t.v . suicide thing go ?

oh yeah , that 's it .

because you 're an idiot .

what are you doing here ? !

is this turnout weak or what ? i had < u > at least < /u > seventy more people at my funeral .

monday morning , you 're history . i 'll tell everyone about tonight . transfer to washington . transfer to jefferson . no one at westerburg 's going to let you play their reindeer games .

you stupid cunt !

no . hell no .

come on you jerk . you know you used to have a sense of humor .

we made a girl want to consider suicide . what a scream . what a jest .

that episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy , but you 're determined to ruin my day .

you wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school . if i was n't already the head of it , i 'd want the same thing .

ouch ... .the lunchtime poll . so what 's the question ?

veronica . finally . got a paper of kurt kelly 's . i need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in kurt 's handwriting and we 'll slip it into martha dumptruck 's lunch tray .

i 'm giving veronica her shot . her first remington party . blow it tonight girl and it 's keggers with kids all next year .

grow up , heather . bulimia 's so '86 .

teenage suicide ; do n't do it !

what do you want from me ?

because i can be ! the same fucking cheek , goddamnit ! why are you pulling my dick ? do you think , do you really think , if betty finn 's fairy godmother made < u > her < /u > cool , she 'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends ? no way ! uh-uh !

no .

you 're not funny . ouch !

i said i was sorry .

do n't worry . we 'll work something out .

veronica . what are you doing tonight ?

no way , no day !

just push the red button twice . that 's what stops it . if that 's what you want , babe ?

you 're not listening . people are going to look at the ashes of westerburg and say there 's a school that self-destructed not because society did n't care , but because that school < u > was < /u > society . is that deep or what ? i 'll let you put it in your diary , babe . free of charge .

you did n't say simon says .

this knife is filthy .

get off my bed , you sick psycho ! you think you 're a rebel ! you 're not a rebel ! you 're a sick psycho ! do you think you 're a rebel ? do you think you 're a rebel ? i wan na know !

may < u > be < /u > .

let 's just ... settle down . ms. fleming has given us a chance to atone for ...

you kids are making too much damn noise .

do n't < u > even < /u > talk about that stuff !

she wants to ignore the high school experience . our way 's better . we scare people into not being assholes .

did not .

did to .

uh well hey , let 's take a look at the homosexual artifacts i dug up . now , prepare to be a little disappointed .

first tell me this similarity is not incredible .

french .

i can do heather 's handwriting as well as my own .

stop kidding around . i 'm going to have to send my s.a.t . scores to san quentin instead of stanford .

what are we going to tell the cops ? `` fuck it if she ca n't take a joke , sarge . ''

same difference . oh jesus , i 'm gon na ...

you 're not funny .

no luck ? well , milk and orange juice 'll do quite nicely . quite nicely .

okay we 'll use this . she wo n't be able to tell what she 's drinking .

o-kay . we 'll cook up some soup and put it in a coke . sick , eh ? now should it be chicken-noodle or bean-with-bacon ?

i guess i do n't know what the hell i 'm talking about .

a well-timed lightning bolt through her window and monday morning , all the other heathers , shit , everybody would be cast fucking adrift .

killing her wo n't solve anything .

heather chandler is one bitch that deserves to die .

s'okay ... .

dreadful etiquette . i apologize .

sure , i 'm on my way to a party at remington university .

i do n't know . should you ?

i did n't . cherry .

that 's the stupidest question i 've ever heard .

there are no stupid questions .

lighten up , dude . in those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we do n't even have to buy it a hamburger and a diet coke . punch it in !

then get over on my side . oh shit , cowtipping is the fucking greatest .

answer him dick !

what did your < u > boyfriend < /u > say when you told him you were moving to sherwood , ohio ?

you going to eat this ?

i guess .

veronica ! j.d . told me you committed suicide last night !

heather chandler , kurt kelly , and rupert `` ram '' sweeney all had good looks and popularity , but there 's one thing they did n't have : values , ambition , and hope .

are you a carpenter , mr. rieper ? herbert shakes his head .

i adore anything to do with the arts .

mummy has a special technique called `` deep therapy . ''

well . . . i better make myself a bit more presentable .

she says juliet 's in a terrible state . . .

i 've just had hilda hulme on the phone .

sighs as honora puts the frying pan on the stove .

i 'll think you 'll find our mr. bayliss is not keen on seafood . i 've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator .

let 's have 'em now , while they 're fresh , eh , nora ?

looks down at the ground in front of her .

look , mother !

oh , no . i 'm watching my figure .

love , you can still write to each other .

you have to let me go !

her parents wo n't be going overseas now . . . they 'll have to cancel their trip . do n't worry about juliet .

i spent a wretched night . it would be wonderful if i could get tuberculosis , too .

well ? tell us ! how 'd it go ?

fruit .

well , actually , mummy 's left that programme now . . she 's far too busy with the marriage guidance council .

mummy !

i know what to do about mother .

do n't worry , gina ! mummy and daddy love each other .

too right . . . but he does n't have a show ! nobody gets into mother 's draws except daddy !

poor mother was completely taken in .

i thought he was supposed to be terribly ill .

i 'm sure they 'll notice things missing .

just a couple more . . .

hurry up ! i 'm freezing !

well . . . no . but it 's so obvious .

you 'll never guess what 's happened ! !

it 's so beautiful !

god , yes !

he . . .

i 'm not ! i 'm going to the fourth world ! it 's like heaven , only better because there are n't any christians .

no . but at one point you did repeat something though . a phrase . you must have been having this recurring dream , you just kept saying this one thing over and over

i did more then that .

okay so ... what 's the safest place ?

i know , my bedside manner 's horrendous .

well that 's not necessarily a bad thing is it ?

these hallucinations i 'm having . i think they 're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way .

allison ? why ca n't remember what happened to my wife ? is it something i 'm on that 's ... that 's making me forget ?

i followed her trevor . i got to know her life . and what a boring one it was . six a.m. gym , nine a.m. trendy coffee shop , noon bookstore , one soap operas , four o'clock news , five wait for trevor to come home . and wait and wait and wait . nine o'clock get ready for bed .

tonight was supposed to be the night , trevor . remember ? i could n't believe you went through five dart games and did n't even joke about it .

someone special .

almost that fast . i got a few loose ends to tie up first . came into a shitload of money recently . i 've always wanted to go to take a trip . we 're just gon na walk into the airport and decide right then and there .

how much time off ?

i 've got a better offer . more time off . a sort of career shift , more in the engineering line of work .

you were supposed to have a date with gwen last night ? gwen deardon ? the supervisor ?

gwen .

what ?

since what ?

why do n't you relax for the next couple of hours ? barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that .

what 's that ?

no , making another woman compete with someone who 's been dead eight months . that 's cold .

gwen , my wife 's dead .

you 're giving me a speeding ticket ? mr. mario andretti himself ?

and it shows . least it did last night at the quarry . in a big way .

for me ? trevor ! how romantic ! come here , you .

really , why 's that ?

there is no wisdom , no insight , no plan

enjoyable too . the merger never even felt work for one second .

in a word ? lucrative .

this is n't happening .

oh my god trevor ! it hurts ! ! oh my god , oh my god . trevor , it 's coming out .

eighty four .

uh ... eighty two ?

thanks .

the whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall ? she wanted you arrested for harassment . i told her to chill out and smoke a joint . i 'd look the other way as long as she did you know ?

what ?

you and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident were n't you ?

thanks for coming down mr. gooding . has your head healed okay by now ?

hello ? city ? cops ? it 's a fucking conspiracy !

i do n't know who you are or what you want . i just want to know what 's under that sheet ...

i hear everything . and soon you will know everything . more than you ever wanted i can guarantee that . but i want you to think for a minute first . think about all you 've seen . all the clues you 've been given .

but that 's what i need . to be sure ... to be absolutely sure ...

but i saw these women . i saw their mutilated bodies . i saw their ghosts . i just know it happened i can feel it ...

surrender yourself ... surrender yourself ...

i surrender ...

trevor your body has been completely healed . all the nerve endings have repaired themselves . if there is any pain in your head it 's ... in your head .

hey you 're the guy from down the hall .

wow . that 's good . lots of capers , huh ?

god . sometimes you can be such an animal . other times you are the ultimate tease ...

i 've never said this to a woman before but ca n't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other ?

really ?

you okay ?

it 's not that kind of date .

same with me , pretending i was you . an impulse . why not ? i had this shoe .

i dunno . it was ... an impulse . me , wearing my good shoes .

i ... i 'll do the best i can , bernie .

you 'll tell him i talked you out of jumping , right ? just keep me outta prison .

and give a deposition to the judge .

you < u > woulda < /u > gone in there , you wouldn'ta thought twice ... trust me on that , that 's the kinda guy you are . for a guy like me , it 's a momentary loss of sanity . i was n't thinking clearly . listen , i 'm no hero , john . i just want some dough and maybe a little favor . how much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit ? you did n't spend it < u > all < /u > didja ?

it was you ! i thought i heard ...

huh ? whadda you mean ?

i 'm beginning to ... be aware of that , john . listen , i 'm not gon na do nothing heroic here , you can trust me on that , buddy . whaddaya say we just sit down for a while . i do n't have no tricks , i 'm not that smart . you could , like , rest up for the jump .

you should go in . you 're risking your life again ...

what am i , a goddamn postman ? i 'm way the fuck up here , i 'm scared a heights , and you want me to deliver a letter ? put a stamp on it for chrissake !

sell it to him . you get a couple bucks , it pays for the ride . i got a job , nice apartment . i do okay .

i know a guy who only has one leg .

in bad weather , yeah . mostly i camp out in the woods . i thought maybe you were down on your luck too when i picked you up .

you got a drinking problem or what ?

and you pulled people out ? you 're ... a hero .

hey , you could call me `` bernie , '' forget the `` mister laplante '' stuff . you are naive .

i took a loan on my car and my computer .

mister laplante , i really want to help you , but crazy stories are only going to make it worse . the d.a . is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail ...

`` angel ! '' i did n't say `` angel , '' that 's a little strong . listen , here 's the thing , i got ta get over there to the tv station to collect my million bucks .

it 's november .

often , uh .

i think our best course right now would be to focus on the probation officer 's report ...

mister laplante ...

yeah , like that . same thing .

you mean like bubber ? the hero ?

you do n't wan na know , chick , you do n't wan na know . those guys been in here ?

we 're all assholes , bernie ?

my attorney , she 's just outta law school , about a couple of years older than my kid , for chrissake .

what is it , five days now i do n't see you !

business thing . gim me a seven and seven , willya ?

bill , listen ...

that 's it ! you talked ! you 're fired ! outta here ! get outta here !

you know why ? because it 'll be an < u > excuse < /u > ! it 'll be `` bernie laplante excuse number four thousand one hundred and six . '' no , four thousand one hundred and twelve . that 's how many excuses you have given me , i keep track of them electronically . i heard them all , bernie .

do n't say `` bill , '' bernie ! do n't say one word ! did n't i say `` one word and you 're fired ? ''

bill , i ...

i was giving him some advice is all . preparing him for life . you do n't want him to grow up soft , ev , it 's tough out there , it 's a goddamn jungle .

use the phone , bernie , call him tomorrow , he 'd like to hear from you . where 's your other shoe ? never mind ! i do n't want to know . some fantastic adventure , right ? something really crazy .

three weeks , ev . i did n't tell him i killed anybody ...

he had an emergency call ... a < u > real < /u > emergency .

i am so tired of your bullshit , bernie .

i snuck in .

i 'm going to apologize to bubber ?

underbelly !

he had one < u > tiny < /u > , uncharacteristic moment of weakness . that 's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime ...

`` harassed . '' cause i yelled at him when he 's riding in his limo ? the guy 's a thief , he took my ...

my fault ! my fault ! this nut case goes out on a ledge and it 's my fault ?

if you 're not in the car in ten seconds , i 'll have the cops pick you up .

for god 's sake , tell him i 'm on my way . let 's go , chucky . a police escort is gon na pick us up en route . you too , laplante .

what 's your scheme , mister laplante ? what are you forcing john bubber to do ? what are you -- ?

you remember where i said how i was gon na explain about life , buddy ? well , the thing about life is ... it gets weird . see people are always gon na be talking to you about `` truth . '' everybody always knows what the truth is , like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet . but what you learn as you get older is , there ai n't no truth . all there is is bullshit . layers of it . one layer of bullshit on top of another . so what you do in life , like when you get older , is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that 's < u > your < /u > bullshit , so to speak . you got that ?

yeah . i 'll see ya ... dad .

i 'm working on that . it 's just i got some business problems and ... whatsa matter ?

bodybuilding !

vietnam !

gale ... you 're a very nice person . i would n't want to hurt you ... in any way ...

uh , if you could , just , uh , support , uh , a small airfield ...

you were saying you do n't want a million dollars .

the ... silver ... mike ... award !

what is it ?

hey , listen , great that you 're a career-fiend , i got a wife and family , i ...

there could be problems with something like that mister wallace . what if ... ?

a `` mystery guy ! '' `` not a passenger . '' who ?

you just ca n't bear the idea of good news .

unprofessional .

it 's not unthinkable .

whaddaya mean what do i wan na know ? i wan na know everything . who 's this screwball laplante for pete 's sake , what the hell 's he doing out there , auditioning for the priesthood ? you 're supposed to be on top of this , gale , do n't ... `` quit ! '' you ca n't quit ! it 's unprofessional !

he 's not < u > supposed < /u > to be an actor , that 's the whole point . he 's a < u > real < /u > < u > life < /u > < u > hero < /u > , all he has to do is < u > act < /u > like a real life hero . that 's the < u > beauty < /u > of the < u > concept < /u > , the whole < u > freshness < /u > of it . did she call him back ?

upset ! what 's he upset about ?

does this mean i can stop worrying ? where 'd we put him ?

you would n't push the guy , would you ?

if you reach out , you could get pulled over yourself .

he 's right . it 's unprofessional .

what 's `` cynical '' ?

if i gave you the impression i hated him i did n't mean to . i ... i hate the way he < u > behaves < /u > ... he 's selfish and self-centered and cynical ...

wh-why 's he ... why 's he up there , mom ?

i ... i saw him out the window .

my father did n't have his shoes on when he ... when he came here .

an hour after ... ! deak , for heaven 's sake ! let 's give her a night in new york city . we 'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel ...

i said i wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him .

hello , mister wallace .

i wonder if you 'd mind if we waited for him here , mister winston ...

laplante ! that asshole ! i do n't ... hey , is that you , from the tee vee ? in person ?

do n't be ridiculous . i 'm a reporter .

excuse me , ms. gayley . that guy inspector dayton ... he 's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants ...

i did n't ask him .

what about ?

safety ?

you better believe it , buddy . your average rolls royce does n't have to pass as many tests . you want consistency ? you want dependability ? you want safety ?

whoa , check it out .

oh -- uh -- girlfriend .

are you being helped , sir ?

i ca n't help you if you do n't help yourself . it 's really up to you . brooding endlessly is n't going to help matters any .

you have to put yourself out there a bit more .

i should .

< u > ask < /u > her how she feels .

oh no -- i mean , she 's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and i hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things , too . what i mean is , i guess i 'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words .

that would be stupid .

and please , do n't for god 's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --

listen , no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy , but when the time comes , you have to do it and you < u > hope < /u > the outcome will be good for both of you . you come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race , as difficult as that sometimes can be .

right . so , you have a new place , you 've started working a bit -- i 'm sure you 'll be meeting some new people .

i 'm happy that you 're working again . as long as it comes naturally , that 's terrific . you 've always liked working with your hands , have n't you ?

it 's great . it 's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers . there 's still some fixing up i have to do , but it 's coming along .

how 's the new place ?

oh , great .

uh huh .

why are you mad at each other ?

it 's the middle of the night , sweetie .

' '' ... or i 'll huff and i 'll puff and i 'll blow your house down ! '' and inside their new house , the three little pigs just laughed -- '

`` find a penny , pick it up , all day long you 'll have good luck ! ''

the same thing -- his business pressures , the whole move and everything . he 's frantic about nailing this new job , worried about screwing over his present boss .

have you just plain asked him ?

that 's okay , mom .

neil -- what --

he 's staying with a friend . hurry up now , you 'll be late for school .

the pocket 's a cinch -- i 'll sew it up for you after dinner , okay ?

thank god .

no , honey , i have n't seen him . did n't you feed him this morning ?

why ca n't you just drive me to my old school every morning ?

yeah -- we know him . he 's been hanging around the house .

this is my house .

what ?

i was having a bad day -- i lost that job , i was dependent on other people , i was let down --

boy , you really buckle under a little pressure , do n't you ?

the floor has a nice shine to it . oh god -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine .

the cab 's waiting !

barbara < u > zelman < /u > ? i do n't believe this !

no .

how was lunch ?

it 's just a dumb game they play . you want to be at a bigger firm , get used to the politics .

-- and keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is ? some nice neighborhood .

he made , you know , a remark .

what ?

damn .

it 'll be even shorter if i get that new job . come on .

they do n't expect to get what they 're asking . let 's make an offer .

but it 's what we want .

i know it 's at the high end of our range --

this -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us .

neil , do n't leave the back doors open -- i do n't want holly near the pool .

you 'll see that there 's really much more space than the average three bedroom .

because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings .

it 's been on the market a while , has n't it ?

let 's follow 'em .

i thought i was supposed to stay in my room .

a < u > man < /u > started the fire .

can we keep him ?

the thermometer 's broken .

oh really ? < u > you 've < /u > been going through a lot of personal crap . you , princess di and madonna ?

no .

we 'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then ?

it 's a double .

is it a king or a queen ?

if he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby ?

well , technically it 's not mid evil - - it 's renaissance .

why are people walking around new york with swords , dressed in mid evil clothing ?

what ? who are you ? what do you want ?

lieutenant ?

the guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy .

i 'm in the middle of an interrogation , captain .

hey -- somebody want to gim me a hand here ?

yes -- i think it is .

most people are afraid of death .

maybe he was a lousy shot .

that does n't mean you do n't know what 's going on . you 're connected to this guy somehow . he 's after you -- just like the others were .

lieutenant , you 're really frightening me .

is that it ?

he does n't look familiar -- but then he 'd probably be easier to identity with his head .

around .

no . i do n't scare easy .

central park .

that 's what i figured . well , i have a little home coming present for you .

then she should be an excellent dancer .

she 's the king 's cousin .

that is a thought that does n't please me .

i 'm sure they will .

what else ? what else do you hear right now ?

life . you 've stopped living it . you look , but you do not see . you listen but , you do not hear .

must you do that ?

you can not run from your destiny , conner .

i learned my fill from romeriz .

who are you ?

i know that weapon . it belonged to juan romeriz . he 's dead ?

you 'll have no need for that , highlander .

how ?

it will be a good harvest this year .

we had a bargain . you promised .

how ?

i 've come to strike a bargain with you . i wish to learn the power of changing .

would'st you harm one who comes to aid you ?

why are you doing this ?

i can not explain .

why ?

why is it you never talk to me about scotland -- your life there .

aye ?

huge .

what now ?

be careful , conner .

you wanted the truth -- now you have it .

how did you know that ?

i 've seen it .

that would mean they 'd been trapped in there --

let me ask you something else . at the excavation site in scotland , the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed . the day we found the body someone had moved the rocks , making a hole in the collapsed section . what bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall .

yes -- it is .

how come you wanted to meet tonight ?

i 've lived all over the world .

why ?

i know .

do you always walk around with a sword ?

i do n't know .

what 's going on ? why did he call you macleod ?

if it 's good advice .

why do i feel that you know what 's going on ?

he was wearing a bullet proof vest .

i do n't think so -- but then , maybe you 've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the first national bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out ?

yes . how did you know ?

i do n't think we have anything to talk about , miss hillman .

are you a cop ?

what 's that next to him ?

i do n't know .

someone broke into the cavern last night .

it flatters me you remember , old one . it 's been what ... two hundred years ?

it was not by choice . a small matter of a mountain falling down on us . we were trapped inside . when the time of the gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands . what you thought was the end -- was not . this is the end . we are the last of our kind , macleod .

is there anything else you need ?

you know it 's not safe here for you .

if you search your heart you know all the good you have done . your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just . this room is filled with memories . if you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made . and now , it is for you to make the greatest difference of all . look in your heart , conner -- and you will see the good that you have done .

dear , sweet , rachel . men 's lifes are measured by the good they do .

my dreams died long ago .

i could have ended it tonight , but i did n't .

what are you doing ?

i can take care of myself .

this check is for sixteen thousand dollars . that 's a lot of cash to be carrying around .

i 'll make the call .

the best .

jesus christ , it 's a clusterfuck .

maybe we 're getting too dramatic . it 's three kids . they 'll give up , the cops will arrest them , and that 's that . why would they search the house ?

i 'm going to my desk .

the only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it . he 's got ta cap all three of us before they even read our rights . he 's probably planning it right now .

celebrate what ? going to prison ?

for chrissake , < u > please < /u > ! help me celebrate ! i figured it out !

we ca n't carry all this . it 's too heavy .

everyone knows what we look like , dennis . we wo n't be able to hide .

jesus . what is this ?

bullshit . why would mars do that ?

that cop did n't pull his gun . mars lied . he just started shooting !

we got ta find a way outta here is what we got ta do !

stop it ! they found the truck , kev ! they 're already behind us !

what if he 's dead ? what if you killed him ?

that woman 's gon na call the cops .

there 's a million dollars in there , maybe < u > two < /u > million . i 'll give you half .

give up .

you 'll cap my ass as soon as i step out the door !

you oughta try on the problem i got in here .

hey , dennis ? can i let you in on a personal secret ?

that 's not going to happen , dennis . they wo n't give you a helicopter .

i want a helicopter to take us to mexico .

i got these people ! you try to come get me , i 'll kill every fuckin ' one of them !

we 're not coming in there by force , okay ? no one wants to hurt you .

they 're fine .

take 'm back upstairs , but do n't tie 'm like before . that little fuck untied himself anyway .

aw , jesus , not more of this .

i 'm getting a doctor !

who else is here ?

i do n't know .

cops want to be rich like everyone else . all we have to do is share . and if he wants someone to swing for the chinaman , we 'll give 'm mars .

that 's right . that 's a good idea , mars .

pretty sure i do . yeah , here we go --

is krupchek an aggressive guy ? hot- tempered ? anything like that ?

can you identify this man ?

are you out of your mind ?

what hospital ?

i heard he 's fucked up . they 're taking him to the hospital .

what if it goes south ?

if you shoot me , he 'll kill your daughter . do you want to lose both of them ?

i 'll kill you ! you wo n't get the other disk !

you get the other one when i have my girls . not < u > talk < /u > to them ; < u > have < /u > them .

i also have a couple of million in cash . call sonny benza . ask if i can keep it .

how did you get this number ?

that 's okay . i love you anyway .

why do n't you guys grab some dinner at the thai place ? i 'll meet you there as soon as i can .

the sheriffs will take over when they get here .

we 'll see you in a couple of hours .

go ! if you get out , maybe you can help the police !

i 'm not gon na leave you !

you go , thomas . you get out , and i 'll stay with daddy .

no ! i 'm not going to leave daddy with them !

we can use the crawlspace to get downstairs . then we can run for it .

be quiet ! listen !

stop it .

kevin 's gone , your daddy 's gone , everybody 's gone .

how about dog shit ?

make the pizza . i want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine .

mommy wo n't know . you can do anything you want right now . mommy wo n't know .

want one ?

dennis and mars are in the den . i 'll get your brother , then come back for you . we 'll go down the stairs and out the front door , you understand ?

keep your voice down . i 'm taking you and your brother out of here .

you got ta pee ?

get in the car . < u > now < /u > .

we have to cordon off the streets , then evacuate these houses .

that 's enough .

i 'm jeff talley , the bristo chief of police . so far as we know , your children are okay .

i 'm the chief of police here . i have to talk to him .

what 's that , chief ? say again .

three white males shot junior . mike followed them to york estates --

what 's wrong with the radio ?

he did n't say .

junior kim was doa at the hospital .

goddamned small town bullshit .

no . he said that his father 's unconscious ; he did n't say he was dying .

they have security cameras . rooney would see you coming .

he says that his father 's hurt .

that 's why you get the big bucks , captain .

looks like you 're bailing out at the right time .

then get your men off the wall ! you breach that house , we 're gon na have a bloodbath ! i < u > know < /u > this guy , captain -- i can talk to him .

do n't crowd the house . the alpha 's a kid named rooney . he 's amped up and volatile .

contact the landlord . i want to know employment , friends , family , anything we can find out about this guy .

where 's the office ?

the kids are in here !

we 've got to get those kids out of there !

what does he have on you ? i know why i 'm doing this , but what does he have on you ?

special agent jones .

do n't be funny , chief . you ca n't afford it .

are the disks still in your room ?

charles g. benza . they 're coming !

who is it ?

try al . see if you can open al .

i thought they locked you in your room .

dennis wo n't let me go to the desk . he makes me sit on the floor .

i think he was working on them today , so they 're probably in his office . could you find them and see who they belong to ?

i 've got the boy on the phone . he 's using a cell phone . what was that , son ? i did n't hear you .

where are you right now ?

slow down , thomas . take it easy and talk to me . was your father shot ?

thomas smith . i 'm in the house that 's on tv . dennis hit my dad and now he wo n't wake up . you got ta help him .

how do i reach him ?

then you have everything . you can put them away .

he 's going to kill you . do n't you know that ? he ca n't take the chance that you 'll talk .

they 're still in the house .

these disks . . . where are they ?

you will re-assume command . in two hours , a group of my people will arrive at york estates . you will tell the sheriffs that they are an fbi tactical team .

we want them . you will not let anyone go into that house -- or anything come out -- until my people recover these disks .

what do you want ?

do n't just fuckin ' sit there , dumbass . do you understand ?

your phony fbi assholes .

do you think i 'm going to let you < u > murder < /u > someone ? !

they 're killing everyone . the lady minister ! the un soldiers . they 're at the gate .

can you get me into the ambassador 's reception ?

i 'll be back .

leave it to me .

no , bik , it 's a code word for tutsis .

cockroaches ?

do n't be foolish . there 's more money to be made here .

you will run into the hotel and hide behind the u.n .

ten .

here , here , a thousand us dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family . to let us drive off to the mille collines .

name a price .

they are all tutsi cockroaches .

captain , i must take my family . it is not safe here .

i used to work at the diplomat .

let me see your identity card .

yes . with some re-inforcements i 'm confident we could impose order .

no . but i fear it 's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the hutu militia and the tutsi rebels .

the rebels have fought their way into the city . they have many hutu prisoners .

they 're only taking the whites .

you 're fucking black ! you 're not even a nigger , you 're african ! they 're not staying to stop this thing . they 're gon na fly right out of here with their people .

hold the line here . do not shoot ! the colonel stabilizes the situation , his men watch the militia drive by . paul approaches oliver

the americans , and the un they have you as a war criminal . you are on a list .

how so .

i do not want to go to gitarama , general .

what do you mean , general ?

where are they going ?

your police are at the gate ?

get in .

the finest , and cognac , champagne . come and i will get them for you .

please , i have money . they 're driving into an ambush , it 's on the radio .

i will see what i can do .

i am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel . perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us .

yes , they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder .

satellites ?

watch everything ? how ? they are gone .

the united nations . madmen are on the streets , paul . but i will take care of you . your cellar is well-stocked , right ?

the united nations are still here .

i 'm sorry it is not glenmorangie .

take the river road back . it is clear .

why not ? we are half way there already .

no whiskey , no spirits . your rich cockroaches at the hotel , they will have to do without their scotch . anyway , i have bled that cow enough paul .

you have no whiskey ?

everything is double the price now , you do understand that ?

i am always glad to see you paul .

very good .

go ! what the fuck sort of journalists are we , running from a war ? i 'm ashamed . are you ? well , are ya ' ?

lets go , jock .

holy shit ! holy shit .

for fuck 's sake , gloria there 's a big news story out there ! we need to get out and cover it .

good . i 'd like to book a massage .

the fifth room is your broadcast room .

great , i really need a shower .

are you sure this is the river road ?

for supplies , you drive .

get out of this room and get back to work .

i know that , paul . i 'm sorry .

did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the diplomat with you ? you know ?

how much ?

our cards , please .

what ?

how do you know ?

it is dangerous to be here . the radio says this is a nest of cockroaches .

no blood . as i left a neighbor , an old woman , waved to me . i went to her house . she has the little girls . they are safe .

was there blood ?

they will surely kill us here . it 's over here . we have to take the chance .

pack the bags , we have to move .

i will need a suite .

anais , it is so good to see you .

the diplomat ! tatiana wakens , startled .

please do not talk like this .

what sort of plan ?

we have to have a plan .

we wait until 7:00. if he is not here with the twins he is not coming . we leave . that was your promise . go help the children .

i 'll try but we have to leave , with or without them . i want you to promise .

please , please try one more time .

i want to know .

a car .

why ?

in ruhengeri ?

i hear we must pay for everything . how much for this ?

what 's the matter ?

go to the roof now .

enough of this . we stay together . let me rest , i will feel better then .

what are you saying , tatsi ?

they are being evacuated .

how can we help him .

what !

get in .

call your friends in the army . call someone . victor is harmless . this is a mistake .

yes , paul , i remember . the mille collines is a very important property for sabena . our directors believe we should close down , shutter the place until this unrest is over ?

it 's true , sir , the water has been turned off .

i saw gregoire make a call , sir ?

many beers .

sir , no one wants to work . they say the boss has left .

how dead ?

boss , some of those men are my neighbors , they know i 'm tutsi .

sit up , smile , zozo , do n't attract attention to yourself .

beg your pardon sir , you are hutu . you are safe there .

rutaganda 's place ?

paul , if you have one call in all the world to stop this , who would you call ?

paul , are you there ?

all . what do you mean all ?

paul . are you alright ?

on the street .

there are soldiers .

no , i do n't want you going on the street .

go downstairs , i will help you .

i do n't know .

okay : this may sound crazy , but --

how much more do they need than your death at his hands ?

no need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do .

not too big on it myself -- but then again , not on marriage either .

it was on my dad 's list of `` things to do . '' but the house did him first .

i 'm moved beyond words .

part of the original structure . when it was still an asylum . guy who ran the place -- dr. vannacutt -- found it `` inspirational . '' from some german cathedral a million years ago : `` driving the demons from the mind . ''

c'mon .

no . i 'm going back to try and find ms. marr . if she 's hurt , i 'll tend to her . dead , then i 'm coming back for him .

excuse me ?

donald w. blackburn , m.d .

should n't somebody like , stand guard or something -- just in case ?

-- i did : down here .

yeah , me too .

if this is someone 's idea of a joke --

price did n't make the guest list ... the house did . it wants vengeance .

shit , pritchett ! ! !

yes .

left , goddamnit !

hell no ! ! the house will kill ya !

the soul of the house . everything that 's corrupt about it ... my father trapped it in there just before he died . you see , he purchased the house to restore it ... we were going to live here ... nothing can live here . i was just a kid ... the first time i saw it , i thought it was beautiful ... it was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room ... then it started to move ... then death started to happen ... first the workers.. six in all ... then my father ...

-- well , let 's hear it for small miracles --

a cleaning crew 's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- i think the power of the house fades at dawn .

you said that was an accident .

you 're totally full of shit , are n't you ?

nonsense ! just bad press . all the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father 's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents .

the second the sun hits tomorrow morning . assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you 're still alive , of course . any other questions ?

and we get this money when ?

jesus !

i do n't do groups .

the opening 's still too small , we 'll never get through !

he 's dead ... ?

that 's crazy !

wait a minute ... what are you saying ?

holy shit ! now we know how the guest list was made up . look , these names ... head nurse , ruth-ann stockard ... bjorn jensen , electro therapy ... jasper marr , thomas steven price ... they 're all here !

better living through electricity .

what are you looking for ?

no prob : i 'll just hop down the hardware store --

not in the movie biz . so , c'mon , gim me the truth .

i told you already : jennifer jenzen , executive v.p . of --

most fun i 've had all day .

thanks .

three steps forward -- i want to get up there .

i 'm better than that .

melissa margaret marr , celebrity .

evelyn ... get up ... now !

-- wit ... nesses --

-- what ... are ... you ... going ... to --

question answered .

jesus !

-- oh , for chrissake , that 's a given ; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --

i mean , did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --

asking the wrong person again .

game , set and match , steven . you 've outdone yourself . and i know it 's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it , but inquiring minds are desperate to know : just what did really happen to ms. marr ?

stalking the wild poltergeist .

fine with me . just somebody then better go and round up melissa marr .

-- just not always in the sexual sense .

you know how happy i 'd be if that was really true , evelyn ? and how positively goddamn delirious if you were n't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time !

i gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they ?

oh , i think we 're going to have several .

-- forget it . last birthday the manson family ranch , the year before that : jonestown .

you think this is fucking funny ? ?

-- being utterly fucking useless , what else is new .

i was in the middle of --

please ! something ! oh-god !

and then what happens ?

ever seen one that starts at the top ? 20 stories worth of top ?

business or pleasure , mr. price ?

i am .

-- then i guess then it had to be you . sorry .

what ?

i think ... i may have the answer .

must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow .

-- my loss --

i ca n't remember at the moment .

do n't think so . stay the fuck back .

-- i 'll take the chance , come morning and cops , i 'll be proved right --

-- confirming everything we already know --

i 'll take my chances .

then just wait -- maybe this whoever 's got you next on the asylum 's equipment- test list . maybe a literal mind-blow inside the `` saturation chamber . ''

well , i do n't .

if you 've got a gun on you , price , i 'd hand it over now .

good way to get your head blown off .

-- i would n't worry , ms. jenzen : the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long . in the meantime , let 's all relax , have a drink , the evening 's young --

very good . well , i think i can say with complete honesty : i 've never heard of any of you .

jennifer-jenzen-executive-v.p.- paragon-pictures .

yeah . why 's there five checks ? there 's only four of us .

pretty amazing feat : all that shit down the basement and your wife 's up in the bedroom the whole time .

-- hey ! next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that !

`` dummy 6 '' keeps losing his arm .

-- hey ! --

he must 've unsealed the room !

oh , dear .

accumulated evil ... festering for decades ... but i 'm a drunk ... so do n't listen to me .

it better be -- he still owes me $ 25 grand for renting the place for the night ! here , let 's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely !

melissa ... ?

please ... ..anyone ... .help me ?

colleen .

it does n't say . but that 's not what interests me . there 's no death certificate for the daughter . anywhere .

what 's the matter ?

it will heal .

yes . it was .

thank you . if you told me two years ago we 'd be living here , i would never have believed it . do you live around here ?

suppose not .

pearl , is the twilight , the divinity ... onyx is the sickle , death ...

the knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed .

that poor little girl .

oh my god , what happened to you ? my baby -

your father does n't love us anymore !

h-how long will it take ?

what about all my other stuff ?

we 're going to go someplace new .

i 'm scared !

we 'll have every leprechaun in ireland here honey .

she 's down . help her ...

look daddy ! it 's empty !

did you ever see a leprechaun ?

that 's father , aubrey . seamus well yes i did . lived here my whole life .

ok. if you want this room , you can have it .

sure . did you see the others ?

i 'm all right ...

you 're bleeding .

maura !

we 'll destroy you ... destroy all of you !

not going ! are you out of your mind ? ! wait !

what ?

no . you two are the most important things in my life . i do n't ever want to lose you .

oh my god where is she !

i 'm sure this sounds crazy to you .

just because i have an open mind does n't mean i 'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house .

oh come on !

i do n't know . someone who ... knows about this kind of stuff .

yeah , i 'd say some weird things have happened .

well something just happened to the power upstairs ... maura heads off and shakes her head , troubled by the event -

she 's asleep . i think that 's what i need , too . i 'm starting to see things .

no . maybe it was aubrey .

what the hell is that ?

it 's not going to work . i 'm too smart for you .

i wish i knew more about her .

you did n't think much about that before .

well maybe we do n't need to remind her of it . she has a lot more to adjust to ... new friends , new schools ... it would be good if she had a stable family environment .

aubrey knows more about us than you think .

will , maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while .

i could use a little help . we have to return the van soon .

maura .

she 's at school . we 've tried not to upset her more than she 's been .

she 's coming back . keep talking !

go ahead . i believe right now she may hear you .

so what should we do , father ?

why ?

your daughter 's been taken .

may i come in ?

oh , that 's nice ...

i wish i had an answer . evil is powerful , more so every day it seems . but i believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us .

keep talking !

did you remove anything in the cellar !

what ... amulet ?

well there 's no time like the present . good night .

there 's something through that wall !

not really . oh , wait a minute .

looks like we have some animal hairs in here . maybe some kind of a rodent .

oh .

no . but i 'm a clairvoyant . i can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place .

and i believe what you say . but this is tv . no pictures , no story .

yeah , well like you said - it 's a mystery . but that 's all it is . mystery . not malice . what , you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?

the box , joey . he wants the box .

wha ... . ?

i do n't know ...

i like you , joey . you ask all the right questions . there is something we can do but it will require great courage .

and what did you discover ?

here ! here ! pull over !

yeah . happening , is n't it ?

... but it is good . you know , over to the left , you can ...

no . i buy them to impress people . of course i 've read them .

yeah ! that 's what i 'm saying ! and it was lying next to him . and he pointed at it before he passed out and ...

oh . you wan na talk about that stuff .

i know what you 're saying but ... never ? you 've never had a dream ? no , you know , you do . you must . what you mean is you do n't remember them .

why are you so interested ?

what is it ?

right .

no . no . it 's fine . come now . i was having bad dreams anyway .

you gon na buy ?

can we see ?

what else came with it ? anything still here ?

never mind . i 'm glad it 's gone . made the store feel strange . who 'd make such a thing ?

no . no , you do n't understand . we 're not selling it . it came from here . we want ...

wow . thank you .

yes really .

no . really ?

do n't do that ! do n't put yourself down . if you have a quality , be proud of it ...

he 's a barman . whatever . do you mind if i continue ?

the barman ? i thought he was called rick ?

and this is your club . great club . i really love it here . great club .

it has already begun .

yes .

really ?

that 's so good to hear , sweetheart . it really is . you know , i .. are you alone ?

hey , it has been known . c'mon terri , i 'm not that bad a guy . i have regrets . i 'd like to put things right . do n't tell me you have n't thought about me . huh ?

you 're apologizing ?

really ?

what do you want ?

jp ?

not quite .

joey ?

eighth room down , babe ...

the security 's actually not that severe .

that was beautiful .

you 're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray .

get 'em . they went down the hallway .

alex , are you ... .

`` how 'd we ever get such in a ru-utt ''

`` oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt ''

`` maybe we 're ragged and funny . ''

yeah , i mean , come on , going through the iron curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire , it 's supposed to be strangling a guard ...

geez , this art treasures room looks like a burnt diaphragm .

damn travel agency . that kremlin thing is in moscow , is n't it ?

you bastard . you fucked my freedom for a lousy job .

morning edition . seems two thieves `` attempted '' to steal it last night , but thanks to three `` courageous '' guards , it will be ready for tonight .

ah yes , a rare renaissance piece . da vinci 's `` sforza , '' an equestrian model of a never executed statue . i consider it to be the prize of tonight 's auction of objets d'equestrian . horse things .

paint a woman in a lighthou -- i do n't want to steal a horse . life is ...

`` you could be swinging on a star . ''

`` every day you meet quite a few . ''

`` and all the monkeys are n't in the zoo . ''

cameras ?

whoa , you better cut a bigger hole than that .

i 'm sorr -- goddamn mario brothers . goddamn gates . goddamn rutherford auction house . by the way , how many seconds ?

there goes five seconds ... my record 's eighteen .

i read about these people in newsweek . where 's all the regulars , crazy jeff cava , the todd sisters , indian joe ? where 's ed kranepool 's autograph ? captain bob 's steering wheel ?

oh , not much . mario brothers want me to do a job .

so mr. coffee , what went down outside the prison ?

lousy day ? the man 's getting out of prison and he 's having a lousy day . what , you missing out on the cell block water ballet pageant ? believe me , it 's overrated .

my life is not some deal . i ...

as for our plan of action , anybody 'd be insane to go in from the ground floor ...

lucky for us , the da vinci is located in a wing of the kremlin that they used to throw the miss ukraine pageant and stuff . it 'll have the least number of guards ... .

you 're supposed to be dead !

what the hell ... .

quit bitching , you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit ... ah to be in pari-is and in love .

i 'm going to find out .

he came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure . but he knew right and wrong . oh , and we kind of messed around ...

let me be the one to quote scripture . ... .as an agent of our organization , you are put in awkward situations . just remember , hudson hawk is an evil , evil man .

attempt , you mean . the vanity of this man , hudson hawk . the vatican has foiled the advances of pirates and terrorists . we will not lie down for some schmuck from new jersey . must you flirt with him so realistically ?

i got my planet back .

hudson , i 'm afraid i 'm sticking with god . but you 're a close second , tough guy . what is that smile ?

have i ever told you the world is beautiful ... i 'd really like to play nintendo with you , or something ...

wha ... ..

trust leonardo ... .

this is too bad to be false .

i told you not to call me hudson . the only people who called me that were the nuns at ...

oh hudson ...

fits my new image . a thief for the masses . this is one job i 'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying . gum .

hey , do n't take your disguise so seriously .

selfish attitude ? i 'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up , not too much foam ...

it 's that kind of selfish attitude that ...

where did you get this ?

wha --

you really went and did it . with one day , not even a day , of planning , you did it . nobody does it better , hudson . you started the week stealing the sforza and you ended it swiping the codex .

secret passageways do n't mean as much as they used to . there 's a place two blocks east of here . enzo 's . say 10:30 .

and i 'll bring my entourage ...

oh , you read that .

nice . but right out of our brochure .

sure hudson . are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on dumbo ?

never , why do you ask ?

that 's what you theenk .

tough guy . what are you -- how 's your head .

thanks tough guy , thanks a lot . why was the guard chasing you ?

no , i meant you did n't have to tackle me and rip my dress . a polite push , perhaps ? a clear shout of `` watch out , anna '' would have done nicely ...

way to go , anna .

hawk , you 're a great thief . got set up , did some time , nothing to be ashamed of . do n't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down , open a hardware store and sell spatulas ...

sure . face down . two endearing shots to the back of the head . that 's your mark , man . what did little eddie ever do to ...

i knew it ! i told you it was a fake .

have n't you ever seen , like david niven ? you know tiptoe in , tiptoe out .

outbid by my own wench , quelle bummere .

i 'll torture you so slowly you 'll think it 's a career ! i 'll kill your family , your friends , and the bitch you took to the prom !

so hawkasaurus , i wo n't mince words ...

so when 's that sebastian-cabot- buckingham-palace-looking- butlerhead getting here ?

you certainly do .

all this trouble for a horsey . i may not know art , but i know what i like .

that 's the beauty . it 's bullshit , but i can make it stick because i 'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who 's about to find out that there 's a thin line between ex-con and escape con .

the only thing you ca n't do is get sex for free . i know i was in prison for like basically the 80 's , but , call me daffy , are n't you supposed to < u > stop < /u > me from committing crimes . you know , book-em-dano , call-for-backup , give-a-hoot-don't-pollute .

and to think i thought you were evil incarnate in pumps .

you ca n't , convict ! you 're just a shmoe ! every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them . it rains , car crash stops traffic , you say `` how could this happen to me ? '' it 's a natural inclination . but for i , this is n't a fantasy , it is < u > reality < /u > ! you are on my planet ! you walk around the corner for coffee , out of my sight , you do not fucking exist ! the lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich , to the powerful , to me !

it 'll take a couple of years of steady production , but i 'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself , the foundation of all finance , will lose its meaning . brokers , economists , and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns . markets will crash- crash . financial empires will crumble-crumble .

you killed a friend . why should i help you go for the gold ?

guess i know who wears the penis in this family .

do n't be stupid ... they ...

tonight ? you 're whacked . the timing 's off , i 'm underequipped damnit , i have a date !

good news , bud , the mayflowers have moved up the time-table . you 're hitting the vatican to-night .

why does this have to be so hard ...

i do n't think you 'll appreciate their choice of weenie .

no , somebody powerful . oh . look . what 's that up there ?

bastard , you 're going to need another nose !

the hudsucker hoop !

with a little jazz .

something short .

sure , sure , we 'd all be millionaires . there 's no point in looking back . at the time , stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market , further depress the stock -- then we 'd buy it all back , and more of course , once it got cheap --

he did n't look unhappy !

i 'm happy enough .

well , maybe i --

yeah , yeah . say , you wo n't tell anyone about me , will you ?

ah keeps the ol ' circle turning -- this ol ' clock needs plenty o ' care . time is money , miss archuh , and money -- it drives that ol ' global economy and keeps big daddy earth a-spinnin ' on 'roun ' . ya see , without that capital fo'mation --

ah guess ole moses knows jes about ever'thing , leastways if it concerns hudsuckuh .

you 've lost it , aim . you 've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from dubuque --

but , al , it 's the bunk ! norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day i met him ! why buzz could n't have invented it -- look at the man -- he 's an imbecile !

ol ' satchel-butt ...

yeah , i was all wet about your idea man ... well , thanks for being so generous ... it is human , and you are divine ... no , he 's no faker . he 's the 100 % real mccoy beware-of- imitations genuine article : the guy is a real moron --

lumbago .

and is this guy from chumpsville ? ! i pulled the old mother routine --

barman ! set 'm up , fella !

huh ? !

now , aim --

shutup ! -- but then i figured out you were a swell guy , a little slow maybe , but a swell guy ! well , maybe you 're not so slow , but you 're not so swell either and it looks like you 're an imbecile after --

we have to be realistic , amy . you know things have slowed down a little here at hudsucker --

for pete 's sake , norville !

oh , norville --

well , the hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants . some will be butterflies . others will be elephants or creatures of the sea .

every year ?

uh -- yes . seventeen . yes , i -- well no , i -- i never really ... there 's a place i go now , the cutest little place near my apartment in greenwich village . it 's called ann 's 440. it 's a beatnik bar .

norville , you ca n't trust people here like you did in muncie ...

oh , i do n't blame them , really . i guess i have sort of made a mess of things . these folks have to protect their investment . most of them are very nice people --

... i 'm sorry .

let me look .

yeah , you know . probably dresses in men 's clothing , swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole , and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named biff or smoocher or ...

i 'm quite sure i do n't know what you mean .

oh sure , you 're biased -- you 're a fellow muncian . but would an imbecile come up with this ?

please ! norville !

well , i just do n't know how to thank you , mr. barnes --

oh , of all the foolish ... listen , do you take shorthand ? are you familiar with the mimeograph machine ?

why yes , do you know it ?

well , do a follow-up : hoover : hero or mama 's boy ? the rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that idea man story !

i filed it yesterday .

yeah , well , monkey or not i 'm still editor of this rag . amy , i thought you were doing that piece on the f.b.i . -- j. edgar hoover : when will he marry ?

sez who ?

amy -- take a break . you 've worked hard on this story -- heck , you broke it for us ! but it 's passed you by and smith here has taken up the slack .

archer , you 're a broken record . fact is gunderson did design it -- apparently he 's some kind of prodigy --

you ca n't print that !

watch it , archer --

nooo , i do n't guess you will be .

so ya see , i wo n't be in the mailroom long .

terrific .

for instance , take a look at this sweet baby ...

i got big ideas , though !

i want a martini ! on this bar , right now ! i 've had a martini in every bar on the way down here , and i 'm not about to --

it 's a juice and coffee bar , man , like i been tellin ' ya --

i thought you served misfits here !

i want a martini ! it 's new year 's eve and i want a martini !

what the heck 's she doin ' , lou ?

but he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me . what gives !

-- uh ... buzz , i 'm sorry , i -- buzz , you got ta forgive me ! i should n't a fired you , i did n't know what i was doing ! i was a little funny in the head , i --

get up !

nobody wants a hare-brained product like this ! ya see , buzz , it lacks the creative spark , the unalloyed genius that made , uh ...

... why , this is worthless .

oh , uh ... buzz ... is it important ?

waring hudsucker ! na-ha-ha-ha-ha ! say , buddy ! when is the sidewalk fully dressed ? when it 's 'wearing ' hudsucker ! na-ha-ha-ha !

waring hudsucker ! na-ha-ha-ha-ha ! say , buddy !

... yeah , go ahead .

-- tough titty toenails !

' ... and so , sid , the future does not belong to such as i -- nor even you . we have made our compromises with time . the future belongs to the young , who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption . accordingly , in the spirit of hope , and the ringing in of the new , i hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company , and my seat on the board , to whomever is hudsucker 's most recent employee at the time of my demise . i know this will disappoint you -- you , sid , who have served so diligently and for so long . but -- '

yes sir ...

sir ?

anyway . any particular reason you did n't give him my blue letter ? i mean , jesus , norman , just a dying man 's last words and wishes , no big deal .

i need that voucher ! i told you a week ago it was important !

... this 'll only take a moment .

you have a charming wife , mr. muss -- uh , sid .

i 'm brushing up on my french with the most charming man , pierre of fifth avenue . do you know him ?

ya do n't say .

sure , sure , it 's a tough course . well thanks for coming , kid . i thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we 're having some security problems here at the hud .

finally .

thank you , sid , but the reason i mention it is , it would require such a small capital investment -- again , you 're the expert here --

that reminds me , mr. mu ... uh , sid . i never did give you that --

why you nitwit . you almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career !

my god ! the bumstead contracts ! !

but --

get your feet off that desk .

sure , sure . and did your classmates there call you 'jerk ' or ... ... 'schmoe ' ?

wait a minute !

tell him i 'll be right there ... well , what is it ?

i --

she 's good , bennie .

no , bennie : lumbago .

plan two : here come the waterworks .

... he 's not noticing , benny .

... no money .

twenty bucks says not here she do n't find one .

ya get the special ?

yes , miss betsy . i mean that . the houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to shango and damballa .

no . she was mindless but not like miss jessica . but the houngan cured her .

there are other doctors ... yes , other doctors ... better doctors ...

doctors that are people ca n't cure everything .

doctors and nurses can only do so much , alma . they ca n't cure everything .

looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- i do n't know whether i 'll be able to get away with it .

we 'll see if we ca n't make her well , alma , you and i .

if you say , miss . and the enormous boat brought the long-ago fathers and the long-ago mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor .

times gone , fort holland was a fort ... now , no longer . the holland 's are a most old family , miss . they brought the colored people to the island -- the colored folks and ti-misery .

wait . do n't draw any conclusions . let me explain .

mrs. rand .

have n't i ? i suppose i take it for granted . it 's just part of everyday life here .

i 'd love to .

thank you , mrs. rand . i think you 're every bit as nice as wes says you are .

i really intended going out to the fort and meeting you long before this , miss connell . i 'm mrs. rand -- wesley 's mother .

thank you .

i prepared these for you last night , miss connell .

i 've never heard of a cure .

does she suffer ?

i 'm afraid i 'm not able to tell you much . only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a mr. paul holland with whom we do considerable business .

yes .

please , wes , do as i ask . you must rest , you must sleep .

i 'd like to go now , rand . would you mind taking me home ?

wait . i want to listen .

listen , did i tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and clement ? let me tell you . it 's one of the funniest stories --

i 'm a nurse . i always watch people when they pour something . i watched ti-joseph and it was exactly two ounces .

how do you know there 's two ounces in a drink ?

higher mathematics . two ounces to a drink -- three drinks , six ounces .

by a curious coincidence , it 's my day off , too .

well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you 'll find . i 'd better come along and show you the town .

i was just beginning to wonder . are n't there shops , restaurants and things ?

where do you think you 're going ?

it 'll wait .

ah , yes , our paul , strong and silent and very sad -- quite the byronic character . perhaps i ought to cultivate it .

i do n't know . he spoke to me last night on the boat . i liked him very much .

yes , the redoubtable paul . he has the plantation , and i , as you must have noticed , have all the charm .

of course . it 's been nice of you to spend this much time with me .

i wondered about your different accents . i 'm still wondering about your names -- rand and holland .

and that -- is my chair . and this -- is miss connell -- who is beautiful .

i guess i 'll wait until i 'm home , mrs. rand .

you wanted to warn me ...

i can understand that . everyone feels that way about someone .

you ca n't believe that . you do n't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad . you 're not vicious or cruel , paul .

and instead , i came -- bringing you nothing .

i imagined this so differently ...

i know what you went through tonight . i kept thinking of what you said : that all good things died here , violently .

i 'm afraid it 's not very frightening . they have their songs and dances and carry on and finally , as i understand it , one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people .

i heard someone crying -- a woman --

ah -- that 's where reason took hold .

and what happened then , mrs. rand ?

i think i do . i 've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient 's throat .

wesley !

of the nature of mrs. holland 's illness . and , of course , the events which led up to it .

investigation of what ?

what about her ?

you admit that it is terribly dangerous . why do you advise it ?

foolish ? tell them how foolish it is , paul -- tell them !

because he drove jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly !

if i were as sure as you , mrs. rand , we would n't be here . i 'll tell you quite bluntly : for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety , we 've come to ask you to send mrs. holland away to st. thomas .

in rhode island with the folks . i 'm a free agent tonight .

benjie !

right o ' .

gotcha george , not a problem . tomorrow . hey , you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself ?

oh you know , for a minute i thought it was --

i 'll drive you --

thanks for the diagnosis , ben . thank you . so let 's just go to this fiasco if that 's what you want to do . let 's just go on in . i 'd rather talk to anyone else but you .

that this was going to be a key party ?

in the car .

you 've ...

benjamin . that 's supposed to explain it ?

well , what kind of faithfulness are you after ?

elena , what are you 're talking about ?

it would n't make a pleasant evening , if that 's what you 're after . i do n't want to talk about it . stupid mustache cup .

see for yourself .

oh , just dropping off a coffee cup . jim left it , last time he was over . it was on the dash of the car . you were , you know , reading , thought i 'd just catch some air . let 's eat .

the turkey in ?

yikes -- i was hoping to wear this thing to the halford 's friday .

i was n't accusing you , ben . it 's just that we 've got to be honest . not just with ourselves , but with the children .

i 'm just sad ben -- i mean it was ... you were , but , you know . i just do n't know ...

you know elena , i 've been thinking --

what do you think ?

the halfords have invited us again this year .

so maybe you 'll come too ?

and as usual no one believed me ...

no thank you . we should be off .

about ?

yeah .

hnnn .

classes ?

i 'm fine dad .

jimmy ? jimmy ? i do n't know how to take this . and what do you mean , jimmy ? i thought you said you and your husband --

listen , benjamin hood . i have obligations that precede your ... from before you showed up . one or two , you know , good-natured encounters , that does n't mean i 'm ... i 'm not just some toy for you . when i remembered some chores i wanted to get done before the party , i just did them , that 's all , because i wanted to do them before i saw jimmy .

what are you talking about ?

birth control .

here .

you have a point there . that 's a very good point . we 're having an affair . right . an explicitly sexual relationship . your needs . my needs . you 're absolutely right .

c'mon .

he 's probably been waiting all night at the station .

i mean , he 's not serious , he 'll end up living off janey and jim , you watch . it 's just that you develop a sense when you get older , if things are going to work out or if they wo n't , and sometimes it 's not worth the mess ...

who else would i be talking to ? and take that thing off !

what do i think ? i think you 're probably touching each other . i think you 're touching that reckless jerk-off , for god 's sake , and i think he 's trying to get into your slacks . i think , at fourteen years of age , that you 're getting ready to give up your girlhood --

what do you think we 're doing , dad ?

... while children in africa and asia are napalmed and --

get to sleep young lady -- and i mean it .

what ?

but i -- well maybe i love her . elena .

-- 73 , and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket , and for crying out loud , ben , be a man and just get it over with . i would have if i 'd had the chance .

advice ? i 'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you , ben . unless - have you quit your job ? they fired you ?

-- well what am i supposed to call you ?

hello you two . am i barging in on some kind of religious study group ? elena , you look marvelous . will i see you and ben at the halford 's ?

yeah . you ?

now do n't make me feel as if i 'm being too forward , ok ? if you do n't --

you want coffee or something ?

thanks , but -- oh , i do n't think so . it 's been kind of a discouraging evening .

what sort of problems are you planning exactly ?

just curious . if there 's a problem , i guess i 'll just call you there to interrupt .

we 're going to the halford 's . the number 's on the calendar in the kitchen . we should be home around 11 .

i thought you quit the band - i never hear you practice anymore .

oh wendy .

hi mom .

thanks again . for the dinner .

i 'm afraid she 's something of a gossip , is n't she ?

ouch .

i would say it sounds like you 're trying to get me into bed .

no need to make excuses --

pharmaceutical ! you are a god .

huh ?

all will be revealed , baby .

aha ! i could sense the vibe .

how can you do that man ?

and remember , with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb , do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you 're stoned .

where you going ?

no more man . i 'm about to drop as it is .

the water , as you call it , is a special mixture of amaretto and ben & ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious thai stick .

everything 's gon na freeze , the big freeze .

hell , i guess he takes after me , huh ?

sorry honey . hell , we 've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed .

hey . i 'll take this stuff .

you do ? i 'm glad . because i feel for you --

and i have a special feeling too , because i do . it 's special .

great , thanks for the tip .

yeah , well , you 've been in love with like every other girl here , i was wondering when you 'd get around to libbets .

i 'm in love with libbets casey .

yeah . when it freezes , i guess that means the molecules are not moving . so when you breathe , there 's nothing in the air , you know , to breathe in to your body . the molecules have stopped . so it 's clean .

who said so ?

i 'm sorry if i got you into trouble . maybe we do n't have to , you know ... unless you really want to .

you 're parents at that party ?

huh ?

you like him ? he worships you .

i do n't know .

tell sandy ? what ?

did you tell sandy ?

sure . twinkie ?

what are you doing at home on a friday night ?

um , ten-o-five . why ? where are you ?

is this charles ?

can i come ?

calling an individual , charles , in new york . confirming a social outing for friday night .

watching what ?

i love you .

one more shot ?

want a drink ?

do n't worry about them . they 're at that party , getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about mcgovern and stuff .

yeah .

i have to go to the bathroom .

well , you can ...

maybe you could drive him to spencer 's .

good .

detective dormer 's not leaving for a few hours .

it 's only gon na make you crazy .

will , you ca n't blame yourself .

wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here .

four unwarranted shootings , witness intimidation , and cocaine theft .

walter byrd killed kay connell . her things are in the house .

not really .

she your only sibling ?

i could say the same thing about you .

yeah . all over .

the bartender at darrow 's . he was there friday night .

do n't give misdemeanors a bad rap .

my partner ...

we just got ta catch the bastard , right ?

sorry about ...

forget your pager ?

i 'll stick it in the evidence locker ...

randy stetz . her boyfriend . we 've questioned him , searched his place . did n't find anything .

who was the last one to see her alive ?

she 'd come to me , sometimes in the middle of the night . bruises all over her back , her upper arms . i pled with her to let me call the police , but she would n't hear it . wanted to keep it a secret .

that boyfriend . randy .

how do you mean ?

goddammit , hap . think about what you 're doing ...

mike flynn 's a dirty cop , hap ! we are nothing like mike flynn . we did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch dobbs paid for what he did . and every bastard like him . we say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they 'll all walk . every last one . and i am < i > not < /i > going to let that happen . no deals . no compromises . no discussions .

cut some kind of a deal . i heard that 's what flynn 's doing ...

you know what about .

even the best make mistakes .

seven years .

we 're under investigation now . back in seattle . hap wanted to talk . as soon as we got back . thought he could work out some kind of deal .

me and hap . a year and a half ago . i knew the second i met dobbs that he was guilty . smug , cold . dead eyes . we had circumstantial evidence , but nothing to tie him to it . nothing concrete . went over every inch of that apartment .

will ... i ...

that 's not what he thinks .

i 'm always all business .

good to see you , too , randy .

she did n't tell me .

how should i know ? ...

she loved me . she wanted to see me every night .

huh ?

my arm !

what was ?

you want me to take you somewhere ?

must be tough for you . what happened .

where 's your back-up ?

if you want it to be ...

do n't you pull that shit with me .

but we work so well together ...

i thought maybe we could talk some more .

told you i could write an ending .

he . well , he ...

what about him ?

does n't sound like a mentor to me .

but you wanted to .

down at the station ?

you 're going to be brought in for questioning .

we are a pair , and that 's what counts .

you made me see their failings , louis . you made me look at them with your eyes .

you were their leader . they trusted you .

no .

you did n't even warm them , did you ?

you let them do it .

louis , they can not be brought back . there are some things that are impossible , even for me .

you ca n't believe i 'd leave without her . armand ! you must save her ! you have no choice .

you would never give up life . if the world were reduced to one empty cell , on fragile candle , you stay alive and study it . you see too clearly . you see too much .

but you asked the wrong questions . do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality ? how quickly they perish of their own will .

it 's already begun . if you want to save her , send her away .

she is .

claudia is dear to me . my ... daughter .

knew ? you mean he is ...

my god ... so it 's as i always feared . nothing , leading to nothing .

perhaps ...

surely you know the one who made you ...

nothing if not vampires ...

so you have the answers ...

are you the leader of tis group ?

monstrous .

no . laudanum .

oh , lestat . i must do more than that . i 've brought a present for you .

is that supposed to frighten me ?

yes . and i 'll tell you something else ! i 've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you .

be glad i made you what you are ! you 'd be dead not if i had n't .

did you do it to me ? ? ? ?

you made us what we are , did n't you ?

but it was n't always so ! i had a mother once ! and louis - he had a wife ! he was mortal the same as she ! and so was i !

it will grow back again !

what you are ? you would be something other than you are ?

which of you did it ? which of you made me the way i am ?

you always give me the doll on the same night of the year .

yes you are , my dearest . you are mine and louis ' daughter . you see louis was going to leave us . he was going to go away . but now he 's not . he 's going to stay and make you happy .

yes , cherie , of course you want more . and i 'll show you how to get it . you drink from morals , my beauty , but from me ? never again .

more .

what died tonight inside that room was not that woman . it will take her many nights to die , perhaps yeaars . what has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human .

bear me no ill will , my love . we are now even .

yet you could do it to me ! snatching me from my mother 's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale ! could n't you have waited ? six more years and i would have had that shape ! and now you weep ! you have n't tears enough for what you 've done to me .

do n't make me , claudia ! i can not do it !

how do we seem to you ? do you think us beautiful , magical , our white skin , our fierce eyes ? drink , you ask me ! have you any idea of the thing you will become ?

let him go , he said . let him go .

so you felt it too !

i lothe them ! i ca n't stand the sight of them ! stupid bourgeois parisians , all dressed in black like some private club ! i 've searched for them the world over and i despise them !

this is no performance .

mortals , mortals everywhere . and lots of drops to drink .

are they my kind louis ? dolls never change either .

yes .

hush , claudia , hush now my dear -

and you never cried -

you never talked to me like that - in all these years .

he 'll never let us go .

but now 's the time to end it , louis . now 's the time to leave him .

i took your life . he gave you another one .

you want me to be a doll forever ?

sit still . it 's not finished -

he jests .

infant death , he calls me . sweet daughter death . you know what he calls you ? merciful death .

but you never let me see you kill , louis .

the way i learn everything . by watching you .

i ca n't bear it louis ! the machines out there , that fly and that roar ! and such lights ! they make the night brighter than the day !

do n't try to speak ... it 's alright ...

claudia ! ! !

claudia ! do n't do this thing ! ! !

she would sleep in my coffin , daily , curl her child 's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of i know not what ...

you are the devil ! you are the instrument of satan !

lestat !

ah , but we have even more in common with our creator . come , i am like a mother tonight . i want a child .

oh god lestat . i felt peace . i felt an end to the craving .

do what it is in your nature to do . and you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms .

in the old world , they called it the dark gift , louis . and i gave it to you .

you finish her - if you feel so much -

i do n't pretend to know .

we belong in hell .

come the new orleans then . there 's an opera on tonight . a real french opera ! we can dine in splendour !

the dark gift is different for each of us . but one thing is true of everyone . we grow stronger as we go along .

i ca n't .

read her thoughts .

but we can live without taking human life . it 's possible .

there 's nothing in the world now that does n't hold some ...

we can live like this ? off the blood of animals ?

you must get into it . it 's the only safe place for you when the light comes .

dear god , what have i done ?

what have i done ?

you 're body 's dying . pay no attention . it will take twenty minutes at most .

because you 're as strong as i was when i was alive .

i wish i were . but if i were , what would i want with you ?

kill me if you will , but i ca n't do this ...

you 've just done it -

call him .

you have to ask me for this . you have to want it , do you hear me ?

you 're not afraid of anything , are you ?

you want death ? is it death you want ?

dear god . i 've failed again , have n't i ?

you need a new passion , louis , a new reason to feel ... what a story you 've told , you do n't understand yourself .

peasant rumours , superstitions about garlic , crosses , stakes in the hear , all that - how do you say again ? bull shit . but one of our kind ? not a whisper .

you loved your wife , surely .

you said the slave had a crucifix ...

yes .

what can i do to put you at ease ? shall we begin like david copperfield ? i am born , i grow up . or shall we begin when i was born to darkness , as i call it . that 's really where we should start , do n't you think ?

perhaps lucky for both of us .

it 's just a room ...

you followed me here , did n't you ?

what do you think she is , madeleine ? a doll ?

is that bad ?

then i 'll call the mainland for a charter .

it 's our version of winter . 201 and 202. there 's scrabble and parcheesi in the lobby . enjoy .

stupid . what were you thinkng ?

up-tighteous and self-righteous .

that 's why you 'll come with titus , mon .

i do n't know ...

only he was n't dead . he killed barry and helen last july fourth .

they never found the body .

karla !

i 'll be givin ' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it .

the dockhand guy . hanging by his neck from up there .

no .

julie , you left four messages ... four .

i know it , and it feels good . hi , ty .

julie , people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers . it 's a fact .

tyrell , i appreciate it , but have you seen my people dance ? we make the mouth face , we move the fingers --

no means yes .

there 's nothing between will and me .

listen to me , julie . ray 's a great guy , nothing against old ray , but he 's so ... ray . i mean , he lives in southport . will 's a nice guy , too , and he lives right down the street .

i thought you were out of town !

what are you doing in my closet ?

oh ... it 's not working right . you 're home early . did i scare you ?

okay , i 'll try . but , listen ... if i do n't make it up , then you go ahead and have a great time .

what ? the bahamas ? you 're kidding .

it 's not like that . it 's not you . it 's me . my head . i want to go back . i want to be with you . i want to be fine . i want everything to be like it used to be . it just is n't .

every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first .

yeah .

wait , it 's nancy --

do n't kill me --

you 've got all these theories but where is he ? where ? where 's your fisherman killer ?

tyrell , you are an unstoppable force of nature .

... why ?

i trusted you .

he 's in it with willis ?

come on . we 're gon na be okay .

what ? what are you talking about ? where ?

are you sure ? i really appreciate it .

i scared you -- i crossed the line --

oh , will ! i 'm sorry .

fumes build up in the fuel tanks . you can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet . planes use o-rings ... which freeze in tap water . planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all .

deep breaths --

are you sure ?

it was one year ago ...

i 'm sorry .

i 'm not hiding up no tree . i 'm with her . let 's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho 's butt .

are you crazy ? we 're not staying here on our own .

see any dead bodies out there ? any fresh kill ? how 'bout freddy , jason ?

why ?

they all start to look the same once you 've worked in one . am i right , sister ?

guess the capital of brazil --

ai n't nothin ' free in this world . everybody says it , and it 's true . i wanted you all to have a good trip .

just for a minute , baby . i got something i wan na tell you .

he 's probably the only one who can help us .

to a great weekend --

i said we start having fun . and that means now .

oh , no ... did you say rio ?

okay , karla , five seconds . five ... four ...

still here ... thinking ... you mean brazil , the country ?

well , i 'm in school and --

well , karla , what 're you doin ' at home over the long fourth weekend ?

i 'm not waiting ... so give me the gun and keep the ring .

do n't really have the market for something like this ... i can go two ... two-fifty .

well , there 's some flaws in her ...

how much ?

must have missed the sign .

not anymore .

you guys lost ?

what is up with that weirdo ?

where is everybody ?

there 's ten people on this whole island and they 're all gon na end up in this jacuzzi with us .

we did n't get all dressed up for nothing .

you do n't have to . it 's inside of you -- all the glory that was greece - the dancing , the singing and the white marble --

thank you , i 'll do that . good night .

all the more reason to watch him . he 's had some wild notions lately .

or even spirit messages from the next world .

that staggering . his dying so quickly . in your campaigns , have you never seen men who staggered before they died , who talked incoherently walked blindly .

why do n't you stay here tonight ? get a good sleep . you can return to your command in the morning .

he is exhausted .

you collect these to sell , abroad ?

you can have your servants prepare a dinner . that is the way i 'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- death -- i have fought him before . i 've won often . now he wins . let him come for me at my own banquet .

) you feel the symptoms ?

very well . i 'll wager a dinner .

let us put it to the test . protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of . i 'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to hermes -- not that i believe in him any more than i do in science .

i have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say , i believe everything , a little .

she 's right . this is hardly the time to bandy old tales .

if the wind shifts , if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the south -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours .

did your servant got word to dr. drossos ?

did you hear what thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us .

i 'm not sure that it is the plague .

the enemy is in retreat . there will be no more fighting here . i came here to visit the crypts . my wife was buried here . what happened to the bodies ?

there 's no reason to decide any of us are going to die .

last night dr. drossos -- today you or i -- oh , no , oliver , it ca n't be you , i could n't stand it .

where 's thea ?

i know it must be hard . but you have relatives in london -- you 've got a whole world of living , ahead of you --

sleep well .

how could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..

m~ father will take care of it . pappa is wonderful ! no matter what happens , he makes me feel perfectly safe . i could never leave him . i should be utterly helpless by myself .

miss wollsten shares the room with you ?

what are you doing ?

she has never mentioned her family .

suppose , she is n't dead . suppose it was a cataleptic attack ?

she is dead at peace .

when i close my eyes , i see miss wollsten . i ca n't think of anything else .

i will let him go . he is dead to me as he is to all my mother 's people . i turn my hand against him .

what an odd question !

cathy - how does it feel to have a father ?

thea is an orphan .

would n't i ?

you would n't tell that

you 'd do anything to get oliver away from thea . but i 'm going to stop you . i 'm going to tell mr. davis exactly what you are .

no . i mean your other secret - the one you kept bidden even from my father . that old doctor in london -- he told me .

what if he is ?

did n't you ? but now -- what are you thinking now ?

i wish i did n't have such bitter knowledge of you , cathy .

that 's superstition . that 's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - i 'm talking of something else -- cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real .

i wanted to be sure of something , general -- something that has always preyed on my mind . i have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed imprisoned..

this girl -- thea - is not a servant in my household , sir . she is my daughter 's companion . now , sir , if you 'll excuse me , i 'll go have a look at mr. jacks .

was she ill before that girl came into your household ?

her family name ?

theodosia .

you are my friend .

i had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately why ?

how did she die ?

she was beautiful . there was blood between her family and my kin . but that did not stop me from taking her when i saw her beauty , nor did it stop her from loving me .

thea is so like her in every feature

we still do n't know that it 's the plague

it is not necessary to understand . we are leaving and i am thankful .

it makes me fear her .

there is something evil about her .

hero ?

for a moment , when he looked at me so sadly , i felt that i had wronged him . but then --

then why does he persecute me ? my family told me what kind of man he is , how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --

i do n't think so , thea . he has spoken of your mother . i do n't believe he knows you are his daughter .

thea , what is this ? what are you trying to tell me ? `` he stole your mother '' -

it is more than a feud between two families . he stole my mother away from her people .

i knew that feuds still went on , but i did n't think people like you and the general would be involved .

why in the world ca n't you ?

the general threatened me .

but they 're somebody 's children .

i ca n't do that . these families have children .

all right all right .

what did . . .

bert , now listen to me . ernie , will you take me over to my mother 's house ? bert , listen ! it 's that fellow there he says he 's an angel he 's tried to hypnotize me .

stand back .

george . . .

well . . . . . . now , come right in here , mr. carter .

we 're all excited around here . my brother just got the congressional medal of honor . the president just decorated him .

mr. carter , merry christmas .

good morning , sir .

i do n't know how you know these things , but tell me where is she ?

clarence . . .

oh , i 'm not sure of anything anymore . all i know is this should be bailey park . but where are the houses ?

are you sure this is bailey park ?

zuzu 's petals .

what do you mean , no identity ? my name 's george bailey .

then if i was n't born , who am i ?

do n't you understand , george ? it 's because you were not born .

look , i think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here .

no .

you do n't huh ? well , you got any money ?

you have n't got your wings . yeah , that 's right .

i found it out a little late . i 'm worth more dead than alive .

oh , no , no . we do n't use money in heaven .

i have n't won my wings yet . that 's why i 'm an angel second class .

you what ? to save me ?

what did you stop it for ?

clarence , you do a good job with george bailey , and you 'll get your wings .

i know . i know .

hey , violet ! hey , listen that 's violet bick !

oh , no ! but , uncle billy . . .

it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization .

well , this house ai n't been lived in for twenty years .

aw , now , doggone it , ernie , do n't you start pulling that stuff . you know where i live . three-twenty sycamore . now hurry up .

oh , look at this . champagne !

hi , bert .

on v-j day he wept and prayed again .

when 'd you see him last ?

it will ?

will you try to get some sleep ?

all right , all right . here , give daddy the flower . i 'll give it a drink .

well , what happened to you ?

old college graduate now , huh ?

oh , oh . sam wainwright ! how are you ? when did you get here ?

big see ! i do n't want one for one night . i want something for a thousand and one nights , with plenty of room for labels from italy and baghdad , samarkand . . . a great big one .

i 'm all right .

oh , no you do n't feel so good .

now , if you 'll just point me in the right direction . . . this direction ? good night , mrs. bailey .

well , here 's your hat , what 's your hurry ? all right , mother , old building and loan pal , i think i 'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking .

and all 's fair in love and war ?

oh . . .

well , she 's not crazy about him .

yes . sam 's crazy about mary .

hmmm ?

uh-huh .

looks like she can keep harry on his toes .

no . no .

mr. gower ! mr. gower ! this is george bailey ! do n't you know me ?

oh , it 's wonderful .

is it a charge , sir ?

look , nick . what 's wrong ?

that does it ! out you two pixies go , through the door or out the window !

okay . what 's yours ?

maybe you were born older , george .

we have that all figured out . you see , harry 'll take my job at the building and loan , work there four years , then he 'll go .

oh , am i glad to see you .

what 's that ?

i 'm not going to go , george . i changed my mind .

now , let 's hear from you . . .

what do you want to do , hock your furs , and that hat ? want to walk to new york ? you know , they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in bedford falls .

no , george , do n't . . .

hello , vi .

hello , what am i bid ?

all right . all right . now we 'll go over every step you took since you left the house .

george , was it a nice wedding ? gosh , i wanted to be there .

the whole town 's gone crazy .

i just did , but they said you left . this is a pickle , george , this is a pickle .

what is this , uncle billy ? a holiday ?

there 's a squall in there that 's shapin ' up into a storm .

it 's important .

five hundred dollars .

they do n't have that kind of money , mr. potter . you know that . you 're the only one in town that can help me .

well , what about all your other friends ?

no , sir . i did n't want the publicity . harry 's homecoming tomorrow . . .

i 'd like to do that .

would i ? you 're not talking to somebody else around here , are you ? you know , this is me , you remember me ? george bailey .

have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages ?

that so ? well , i 'll tell him . hey , that sounds great ! oh , baby , i knew you 'd come through . now , here 's the point . mary , mary , you 're in on this too . now listen . have you got any money ?

oh , i do n't know . . . why not right here ? you remember that old tool and machinery works ? you tell your father he can get that for a song . and all the labor he wants , too . half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down .

well , why not ? can you think of anything better ?

well , dad 's snapped up the idea . he 's going to build a factory outside of rochester . how do you like that ?

i have a big deal coming up that 's going to make us all rich . george , you remember that night in martini 's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans ?

you have no idea what happened . . .

oh , george , george !

mary ! mary !

going up to see zuzu .

is she running a temperature ? what is it ?

the doctor ? was the doctor here ?

zuzu ! what 's the matter with zuzu ?

where 's your coat and hat ?

you could have married sam wainwright or anybody else in town .

have fun .

remember the night we broke the windows in this old house ? this is what i wished for .

oh , mary . . .

just a minute , dear . oh-oh . . .

that does it come here .

after that , who cares ?

mary . . .

do you like it ?

did n't you tell her ?

about what ?

well , then you could swallow it and it 'd all dissolve , see ? and the moonbeams 'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes , and the ends of your hair . am i talking too much ?

okay , then , i 'll throw a rock at the old granville house .

oh , no . just right . your age fits you . yes , sir , you look a little older without your clothes on .

i do n't know . maybe i will say it . how old are you anyway ?

beautiful .

well , i do n't .

well , hello .

a new magazine ! i never saw it before .

made up your mind yet ?

i 've eaten .

well , then . . it 's usually customary to bring the money with you .

i want to go faster !

what the hell . for you ... .

with the right wind , 15-20 knots .

get on the rocks !

back down !

do n't !

i ca n't help it it sticks in my mind .

no problem , no problem .

i was counting on hours .

i could give you a dozen good reasons .

they 're moving pretty fast .

maybe by now they are .

too hot in the lighthouse ?

shells and lobsters and stuff ?

where 're we going ?

what the hell , we 're steering for it .

throw it .

there 's a shark ... .

we 're carrying weight .

can you get us a line ?

sean ! catch the rope !

how 're we going to do that floating on this garbage ... ?

want to swim home ?

want to talk about it ?

let 's just go sailing , okay ?

i thought you said she was going with us ?

gangway , turkies !

i 'm going out there .

mike 's out there .

well , what the hell -- might be something worth seeing . take it somewhere and see if there 's film in it ... .

that one -- from the wreck . you brought it up , did you look inside it ?

oh .

hendricks . i want to go over your reports and your form 908 .

jesus , do n't freeze on me . what about the others ?

mike ? is that you ?

you want to come here a minute ?

you heard me .

okay , okay .

look , humor the old man -- just be careful .

do i have to ?

every day ?

okay , okay -- stand over there ... .

what else you got ?

you said something about a camera .

will you listen to this man ? will you just listen to him ? you really caused a panic on a public beach , you shoot up the place , god knows who could 've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us ? that could ruin us .

is that what it is ?

temporarily ? uh ... sure ... .

may i have this dance ?

do n't be ridiculous -- sharks do n't take things personally .

ca n't you tell ?

sound . like sonar , or radar . they home in on irregular sounds , unusual sounds , any rhythmic low- frequency vibration .

and sound .

because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish ... .

what makes you think there might be ?

is there one in these waters ?

look , i know a little bit about sharks .

length , 22 feet , 8 inches .

as soon as i heard about it , i called you . this thing is big ! his arms indicate big .

mike 's out there .

going out .

what 're you doing ?

turn in the car . clean my desk , explain things to our sons , then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss .

i try . goddamnit , i tried ... now , i 'm tired ... i ca n't keep fighting it ... i 'm too tired ... i 'm ... i 'm ... .

honey , this is nothing ... i do n't know what it is . what did they ... .

ooohh , nothing . i just got fired , that 's all .

yeah . i think so . mike ! keep it down , for chrissake !

i know what you 're going to say .

all summer ?

use the little brush there . why were you at santos ' ?

sort of -- mathew hooper is aboard the research vessel aurora , presently in the antarctic ocean , and wo n't be in radio range until half-past next spring .

thank you . i 'll tell him .

it 's good with coffee .

you have to smoke so early in the morning ?

need a ride ?

mrs. silvera .

home it is .

listen -- what are you doing later ?

i did , i did .

because they 're playing our song .

my boss and your boss . sure .

where the hell were you ?

chief -- the board of selectmen has a question only you can answer .

do n't push it this time . if you do , it wo n't turn out the way you want , i guarantee you that .

a tragedy . but that was a boating accident ; no bites , no sharks , nothing but a boating accident .

and i stood by while you told the people from ramada and marriott that if they put up a hotel they 'd need $ 800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches ! in new england ? we all lost on that one .

we have to do something .

i 'm showing summer rentals . we got a helluva season going .

1530 hours . might still be there . base out .

when ?

yeah ? then what ?

last transmission said ten juve- niles .

where the hell is air one ?

affirmative , affirmative . turn the kids day-sailing back to port . i heard you . patrol out .

can i go with you today ?

can i go swimming ?

shh . shhh ... .

it killed her . it ate her .

what 's wrong ?

i 've never been supercargo .

great .

you 're not going out right away , are you ?

seventeen . she 's a senior .

hang on , hang on ... okay , go .

does n't hurt to ask . sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest .

tina wilcox .

me neither .

sideways - for every yard we go this way , we also slide sideways this way ... .

wait a minute . promise me something .

what about the others ?

it 'll take us to budapest if you 're not careful .

what about sailing ?

you want to tack , or just leave her pointed up like this ?

double nope !

give me back my hat !

mrs. brody , look -- if he ca n't go , then you ca n't go . neither of you can go .

yep . looked like they were headed to the lighthouse .

mike ? our mike ?

right after , the kids went out ?

happens every season -- someone takes off . once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting .

figure they split ?

we 're fighting wind and current . i though we 'd be out longer , catch the incoming tide .

what 's wrong ?

name it .

that 's fun ! let 's race for some- thing !

that 's not it . my dad told me not to go .

we 'll be over by the lighthouse .

uh . well . maybe you could give polo a hand going in ... .

not tonight .

would you take him ?

i 'm not in the way . andy , am i in the way ?

look -- if you 're going to get in the way , you can just go home .

i want to go with you !

you eat cheerios . i want fruit loops .

yeah . go on , beat it .

you should 've been out there . you should 've seen him waving that gun , like a maniac . there were shots fired !

okay ... have them get it out of the tank .

get the hose ! we 've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him !

he 's going with you , doctor .

absolutely . good idea .

go on , doctor .

what you 're saying is we have a great white shark in the lagoon .

i do n't understand . overman 's too good a diver to disappear .

are n't you suiting up , mate ?

michael , you do n't have to go down there .

me .

somebody better get down there !

it 's a shark 's tooth !

yes , you can .

i have to get out of here .

i did . he wants it on exhibit .

it 's too soon to move him .

i do n't want to see them , kathryn .

i 'm not going to walk through that shark arcade .

yes . it 's faster .

... mean through the tubes ?

no , we 'll go through here .

i need more pressure in the shark tank .

me , too .

finally .

sean , that 's right ...

change your mind ?

kathryn ...

should protect you a little , from the compression . if that thing gets ahold of you .

oh , yeah . really nice . who 's your designer ? sassoon shark ?

yes .

do n't think about it . it 's over .

how the hell did it get in here ?

make up your mind .

up .

yeah , and so will i be if i start swimming in that blackass jungle .

what 's wrong ?

oh , yeah . very .

let 's head to the gate and work our way back .

baby goddamn scared me to death !

are you scared ?

look , michael ... you do n't have to come .

i ca n't leave now . we taking sean out ?

how come ?

honey , i got ta go .

i guess .

you will . i 'll see to it .

we can assume he 's back in the water intake passage .

how 'd it get in here ? !

i think that you and i are natural enemies .

we 're all from the sea , mr. hutton . our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans . by continuing to destroy fish , man destroys himself .

and i like you .

just watch it when he does .

afraid i ca n't do that .

i know it and i will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that !

i want that shark alive .

well , then i 'm going to film it .

i will .

a shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack . you know how many are born ? maybe five . they eat each other before birth ! they 're born killers !

it 's one of the world 's greatest creatures .

i 've handled sharks before . bigger than this one .

i can have them walk backwards .

fine . have them do some .

go where ?

do n't blame yourself .

i knew it ; it 's my fault . we moved it too soon .

and big for his age .

he 's a young one .

hi , mike .

hope with none of my girl friends .

musclehead ?

take it up .

you 're not in the water . you 're in a gondola .

why you sonuvabitch ...

did you see me ? ! was n't i terrific ?

this is where to be . high and dry .

well , i needed a cold shower .

that 's too bad . i do n't like water . i do n't like being around in . i never go in it .

depends on big brother .

i have n't seen that much , but so far it looks great .

i was seeing this guy off . he flew in from dallas . wants to marry me . he 's okay , but texans are so possessive .

ohhhhh shhhhiiiit .

do n't you dare .

got ta sneeze .

ahhh , ahhh ...

i am serious .

i do n't talk that way .

the space shuttle has landed !

it 's disappeared .

on monitor three . was a glimpse of something .

he 's big , hutton . you never saw anything so big . watch yourself .

i 'll stay out of your way . i wo n't interfere .

i 'll go with you .

filter system number four . is it large enough ?

i 'll remember that , my lordship .

polar bears in georgia ? ? ?

hey , i do n't want to hear .

i lost a good cameraman in australia last year . a great white chopped him in half with one bite .

kind of dull in there for you , is n't it ? why do n't you throw in another shark ?

hutton , how the hell did you get my crane ?

hey .

let us know as soon as you have anything .

it 's not closing , mike .

yeah , he 'll really go for that .

well , dad asked me to ask you this , about the wedding . is there any chance you and kathryn will get married in amity ?

mike , this is fantastic . i mean , you 're responsible for building all this . what a job you 've done ! maybe i 'll quit school and come down here and work with you . brody brothers construction . we 've always wanted to do that together . boat building .

last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring . gang of kids were using slugs in the pac-man games .

great . i got one b , two c 's , and eight incompletes .

she is a lovely bit of crumpet at that .

give me a 400-foot magazine ; we may be down there for a while .

that bugger moves fast .

yes , i did .

only children are my favorites . that means you , magee ... .

was uncle sean ever bad ? did you ever spank him ?

i do n't want to . i want to swing ... .

come on , sweetheart ... .

do n't bother hoagie ... .

she could have been killed ... you knew and you did n't tell us ... you let your mother think ... .

thea was attacked by a shark ... .

what 's wrong ? what happened ?

why should there be anything wrong ? i 'm sitting around the house , enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage ... .

it does n't take much to remember what day they come ... .

i miss him , matt . i still ca n't believe he 's gone .

we need milk ... .

it sure is good to be home ... .

like mother , like son ... .

no way ... .

please , mom . at least consider it . you should get away . you should n't be alone now ... .

it was a piece of wood . a shitty piece of wood . it 's not fair ... .

you make sure they come ?

at least he does n't have a beard ... .

i 'd be afraid of losing ... .

you 're not interfering , ellen ... .

i hope the man knows what he 's doing ... .

they wo n't kill it ... .

what difference does it make ? it 's here ... .

you have something to say about everything ... .

we have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it ... .

i 'm on the phone ... .

you check it ... .

the fish . check it ... .

hello ? thea who ? i know it 's thea brody . how many grandchildren do i have ? i know you can use the phone by yourself . you 're a big girl . i know you 're five .

ca n't help myself ... .

stop what ?

good night , daddy ... .

i 'll be in to read you a story .

thanks for the consultation ... .

i did n't .

who 's coming ?

i never ... .

can i ride one sometime ... ?

no .

you looked just like your father ... the first time the shark came to amity ... .

i 'm your mother . it 's my job ... .

there 's nothing to worry about ... .

i m not unhappy . frustrated maybe ... discouraged a little . it 'll work out ... .

i 'm leaving in a few days . i do n't want to do that with you unhappy ... .

i 'm fine ... .

it 's late ... .

children are never satisfied . i have my house , my friends , my job ... my life , michael . i have to live it . besides , i 'll be back . now show your mother what a good dancer you are .

i 'm not going to bother you anymore about your work ... .

he 's not chasing and i 'm not running . and that 's ridiculous ... .

you 're having a good time ... .

mom , please do n't start that again ... .

i have this overwhelming desire to kiss you , ellen brody .

you 're always taking time off ... .

would you suffer through a dance with me ?

a drink with an umbrella in it ... .

sure you can ... .

when it killed sean it was like a stab in the heart . i knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him . i knew that . i know it 's coming ... .

it was no accident ... .

i do n't know why i 've told you all this . i hardly know you .

can you just go off ... ?

just like that ?

want to go for a little ride ?

the wind does that . ever been to the bahamas before ?

get her started ... .

what say we get the hell out of here , ellen brody . ...

will you get the bloody hell out of here ... .

i hope she 's a good sailor ... .

i want you to leave her alone . i do n't want you involving her in ... .

the world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers .

you too , michael ... .

i 'll get her . have a good christmas , matt ... .

let me speak to ellen ... .

inch by inch ... .

we 'll be done pretty soon ... .

tell thea i 'm sorry ... .

i forgot my rubber gloves . let 's do it .

the big picture ... if we ca n't get him to swallow it , we 'll shove it up his ... .

you jump , you 'll kill yourself ... .

what the hell are you doing ?

holy christ ... .

tough shit . 'when the shark bites with his teeth , dear ... '

i do n't like the song .

do n't be so down , man . money 's gone ... shark 's gone ... we 're back to conch ... we 've got it made ... .

'snuck up on me ... . '

what about the monitor ... ? you getting anything on the shark ?

i do n't like it ... .

maybe the gear crapped out ... .

bring her to starboard .

how long have you known hoagie ?

shit ... .

you sure you 've done this before ?

you do n't know shit about anything . time you learned ... .

the shark will get it for us .

we 've got a rare bird here , michael . great whites do n't come to the bahamas . there 's never been one down here before . i 'm not just going to let it swim away .

okay ... we got it together ... .

we do n't write up anything until we 're done ... .

trouble with you , jake , is you have no sense of humor ... .

what ?

i 've struck the mother-lode . i 'm counting ... spade work ... .

oh , it 's okay for you , but not for me ... .

you 're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics . you 're never going to amount to anything .

he 's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own ... .

money is money ... .

sharp shirt , jake ... .

i did n't do it on purpose ... .

should n't pick on that . sorry . i 'm sorry about your brother ... .

hey !

a blind man could find more conch on a mountainside ... .

if you made them right , it would n't happen ... they leak ... .

you did n't stick them on right ... .

the readings suck ... .

i know how to tag a damn conch ... .

woman has taste ... .

manage the whole damn place some day . i 'm looking forward to living in the style to which i would like to become accustomed ... .

oh , jake ...

more beautiful with each passing minute ...

deputy brody will take care of it personally .

i 'll take care of it .

gone to ben masters ' place . cow tipping .

anything to do before i go home ?

you have the safety talk at school , one o'clock tomorrow ... .

you 'll never guess . shut your eyes , mama . shut 'em for little jakie . ha . i 'm gon na steal something . ha , ha , ha , ha . i 'll give it back to you some day , too , you see if i do n't . mama , darlin ' , if i 'm a success in this show , well , we 're gon na move from here . oh yes , we 're gon na move up in the bronx . a lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know . there 's the ginsbergs , the guttenbergs , and the goldbergs . oh , a whole lotta bergs ; i do n't know 'em all . and i 'm gon na buy you a nice black silk dress , mama . you see mrs. friedman , the butcher 's wife , she 'll be jealous of you .

we only got one .. he does n't drive .

the van ?

as i said , sergeant , you nearly ran into < u > me < /u > ? what 's the problem ?

policemen 's bodies age at diff- erent rates . look at me . gut in its fifties . balls in their six- ties . and feet in their eighties ..

it 's twenty of three .

what exactly you doing , john ?

that 's just what i wan na find out .

i dunno what i 'd do with your help . i 've got ta take her out of there ..

everything you say sounds reason- able . but there 's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite .

< u > one hundred fucking per cent < /u > ! .. and you know why ? coz i never told her good-bye . o.k. ? is that good enough for the `` committee ? ''

you do n't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved ?

sure .

she was n't lying about the van .

just makes to so god damned mad ..

car accident .

what does it matter what i bel- ieve ? .. what you got ta worry about is what citrine believes ..

you believe me , do n't you ?

for a < u > dead < /u > < u > dog < /u > ?

they possibly did - but they nev- er had a head , so they never had a bullet - and they never got an i.d . - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we 're the first to get a positive identity .

what are you doing , ross ? i 've had that 15 years ! ..

i need some security . i do n't trust you anymore .

i have n't got it .

forget it . they got stringent hyg- iene rules . he 's long gone in lime .

no way .. not me , mister . i 'm not going up there again . might find someone 's prick in a hot-dog roll .

no , you did n't .

let me just keep going a while . she might remember something ?

i dunno .. i guess this is staff side of the building ?

no you do n't . that 's how you < u > think < /u > you feel about him . that 's how you feel about < u > yourself < /u > . you wo n't give yourself one-fucking-minute for < u > you < /u > .

a dollar ? .. not worth giving up for a dollar ..

you got ta stop smoking ..

you want my advice ?

he thinks you stole his promotion . what exactly you doin there , john ?

there 's nothing in the files ?

what time is it ?

not too good in daylight ..

not for me ..

think i 'll lay down with him . only way i 'll get outta here .

the < u > dogs < /u > ?

`` welcome to eureka . ''

be my guest . what you got ?

alright , you got it . and i 'll be putting an observer in with you .

i 'm talking , outside the girl ?

i 'm not telling you what to do . what i will say , is < u > right < /u > < u > now < /u > , that child 's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..

yeah , that 's all very inter- esting , but where 's the body ?

that , i could n't tell you .. and do n't worry about anya this crap , by the time you 're back it 's gone ..

no .. but we have a theory ..

did you find the knife , sergeant ?

popeye was n't old . younger than you .

did he get you the job ?

cut your own throat , you 're ner- vous about it , tend to hesitate . he 's got three trial cuts , lower left side of the neck , before he works up courage for the big one .

you < u > have n't < /u > . and you got no voice in here , taylor , < u > so keep it shut < /u > .

do n't you know nothing about this guy ? he < u > reads < /u > the newspapers . col- lects the cuttings . when are they gon na find her ? now he 's reading helena robertson 's name , phrased like she 's a fucking witness . you could n't have done anything more stupid if you 'd sat down & tried ..

alright , i gave him the case ? .. so the case is closed , so what ?

do n't lie , taylor . i just had this blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case !

wrong cabinet .

well , apparently , she saw amber the weekend she left , & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with .

yes , sir .

then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving , sergeant . what i said on the phone 's the same as i 'm saying now . i got no idea where amb- er is , or who it was took her there .

as recent as we have .. what ex- actly is your interest in amber ?

i do n't want them to arrest you .

i wan na be near you ...

he do n't know that . i did n't .

who ? probably angelo .. i 'll take care of it .. do n't worry , we- 're gon na find this guy , and everything 'll be o.k . .. o.k . ?

coz you hardly said a word since you got here . but you been thinking pretty loud ..

i have to talk to you , helena .

just your age .

no , i do n't pray .. had a dream once , about god , just around the time i was getting well .. he was a nasty lookin little guy , moved into the apartment right on topa me .. i said , do n't you listen to people 's prayers ? he said , prayers ? not often . they 're junk mail .

i do n't know , i have n't read much . i do n't think poetry 's my kinda thing ?

no , wordsworth .. do you like poetry ?

are you married ?

oh .

no .

hamlet . have you read it ?

i 'm sorry , someone slammed the door on me . i could n't get out .

i got ta admit , you 're one of them . just wish i knew what you meant by a `` hollow car ? ''

no , just a minute or two .. i knocked on your door - no one home , so i followed the music ..

i do n't know .

yes .

lotta scratch-marks on your door ?

can i see your hands ?

no .

when we spoke on the phone , did you know i was blonde ?

you must have some idea about him .

you got a warrant for this ?

yeah , i guess i do .

sure you can . anyway , parties are all about standing still ..

she married some english prick .

even better .

friday night at city hall . got a great chance to frighten the fat .

bobby 's out .. what 's the hurry ?

shut up , king jay ..

you think you 're the only guy ever worked a homicide ? i was a big-city cop too . and i bust- ed the clock on fucken jennifer . i know more about this man than you 'll over know - and that 's how i know it ai n't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..

whass going on here ?

the coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict ?

you can drive down there , sir ..

no .

i did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of el capitan in 6 hours ! i can make this work .

no one has ever dumped me .

listen to me , it 's over .

no .

listen to me !

could you just stop moving ?

it 's all about you , is n't it ? soothe me , save me , love me --

oh honey . it 's spun .

i just heard .

jerry ! do something --

this ca n't be happening to me .

i know . sorry i threw a scare into our lives there --

let 's go . i 'll drive you . _ 45 .

that 's right .

ugh !

and the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket . tell me again , how was it left with cush ?

you know . i do n't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything !

yeah , how 'd it go with sportboy ?

hey , man , tonight i 'm going to teach ray about jazz .

`` it 's okay to eat fish , 'cause they do n't have any feelings ...

cush , matt -- we have a decision to make .

wait . what do you mean ?

you 're imagining it .

this used to be my specialty . i was good in a living room . send me in there , i 'll do it alone . and now i just ... i do n't know ... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life , it was n't complete , was n't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete , because i could n't share it with you . i could n't hear your voice , or laugh about it with you . i missed my wife . we live in a cynical world , and we work in a business of tough competitors , so try not to laugh -- i love you . you complete me .

come on , jerry . you know this is n't easy for me . _ 118 .

i do n't like to give up .

... my soul or something . _ 117 .

well -- i 'm not the guy who 's going to run . i stick .

i was thinking i hope he does n't get injured . i felt responsible .

no no . do n't do that . do n't say that if you do n't ...

sure you 're okay to drive this ?

another time , okay dorothy ?

easy , easy --

no . i have to go in . i live here .

well -- this would be goodnight .

let 's not tell our sad stories .

no no no . i just underestimated her ... her temper , i guess . why are we even talking about this ?

wow . that 's more than a dress . that 's an audrey hepburn movie .

you walked out on a job for me , and i wo n't ruin that .

i mean , the other night was ... i felt like you understood something i could barely even say , something way down deep in the murk -- -- but we have a company here to think about . i wo n't ever take advantage of you in that way again .

plus , you could use that commission .

good evening .

no , i do . i feel like clarence thomas . i 'm like ... harrassing you ... right now .

yeah , i did .

oh shit . you said `` boss . ''

well .

mission ... statement ...

and i am ...

we will be fine !

sorry . uh , let me see , have a seat . i 'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too .

jesus , it 's a real gash , is n't it ?

yeah . that too . i broke up with avery .

oh my god .

hi .

... light .

wait . that 's yesterday , from the other office . today is ...

and i guess we did n't talk about money . so , i 'll just dive in --

you think so ?

nnnnn . i just killed the surprise .

well , take care .

well , thanks .

my son ... my mind ...

hmm . pretty good .

can i help ?

no --

oh , knock it off ! _ 89 .

no no . do n't cry at the beginning of the date .

as opposed to twenty angry women ?

no kidding . i looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen .

he just lost his best client . he called from the plane . i invited the guy over .

you know how much those well child exams cost --

you are a single mother . you have given up the right to be frivolous .

of course , medical ! _ 42 .

ten seconds , rod .

i ... i love everybody , man . i love my wife . my kids . little tyson . my new baby kaydee . my brother tee pee . i love my friends , my teammates , who am i leaving out ?

i 'm sorry , i --

denver got very silent about a day ago . san diego 's got a fever for cush . this stuff tends to happen the night before a draft . people get crazy . and san diego , you should know , is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty . signing bonus of eight . million .

i do n't want to be friends anymore .

why not --

look . i 'm happy to entertain you , as always , but i have a question for you . are we really `` friends ? ''

that 's an answer .

i 'm sorry i asked .

you 're jabbing at me . _ 112 .

i 'm asking you a question --

what 's that supposed to mean ?

well , just stay healthy . i will show you the kwan .

we can still take the offer , rod .

i 'm worried too . i 'm worried that the only reason i 'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you were n't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago .

i 'm a little worried --

you never had the talk , did you ?

no . a real man does not shoplift the `` pooty '' from a single mom .

well , that ai n't fair to her . a single mother , that 's a sacred thing , man . _ 103 .

dude , know your art form . if you put the camera down here , looking up , i look more powerful . there 's no need for a camel ... you got me .

i 'll get you some quick work --

i 'm out here for you ! you do n't know what it 's like to be me out here for you . it is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that i will never fully tell you about ! okay ? ! help me help you help me help you .

what 's wrong .

no , i air-dry .

great word . towel ?

i understand your anxiety .

oh my god .

no .

the least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --

call me tomorrow .

i got ta get back to cushman .

congratulations . you 're still my agent .

jerry . you two will be together forever .

that 's when you need to cement , and define define define .

a year-and-a-half later , we were both in hawaii for the pro bowl . now i 've always hit a wall at 18 months . every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months . it 's like -- ka- boom . the curse of 18 months .

i think you 'll know when you see him at the gate .

alright , i 'm freaking too . but they need you to stay calm . i 'll call back . _ 124 .

i 'm sorry what i said back there .

and say what ? `` please remove your dick from my ass ? ! ''

you gon na get that --

you wanted smaller .

dick .

came here to fire you , jerry .

pardon me ?

gim me a second here ... tidwell ... arizona contract ... new glass cabinet ...

pleasure .

what 's going on , jerry ?

funny .

you said `` fuck '' .

okay . i 've been hogging it . you 're right . _ 76 .

hi .

i 'm not your brother !

hey , man , you know they have big balloons built into cars ?

he should have kept his head tucked down .

what 'd i say ?

eric !

a few of us survived . a lot more died . and we were better prepared and better armed . how many days have they been missing ?

still , you have survived the dinosaurs before . you saved those kids .

either that , or the government will firebomb it back to the stone age .

never had a doubt . never did . us kirby men , we stick around , huh ?

i loaned it to nash . he must have had it on him when he ...

think .

when did you have it last ?

we have to help him .

he 's this way .

eric ! are you here ?

nothing .

no , dr. grant says ...

so do you .

we called everyone , did everything we could . because of all the controversy over this island , no one will step in . costa rica says it 's a no-fly zone , it 's their own damn fault . guys at the u.s embassy -- our u.s. embassy -- said we should `` accept the inevitable . '' you believe that ?

a friend . we were vacationing . eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs , so ben found a guy who would take them parasailing . they never came back .

do n't worry , honey . we 'll circle around and come back .

what 's a bad idea ?

well , i 'm no aviation specialist . but i do know it 's hell of a lot lower than anyone else .

it is truly , whats the word ? inspiring .

who 's that ?

let me tell you a few things about you dad , okay ? he 's very very very clever , very very brave , and he loves you ever very much .

they couldnt climb up , so they were trying to get us to come down .

thirty-thousand , i think . closer to the top .

i did n't know , there were two islands .

no !

you have to believe me . i did it with the best intentions .

billy , i ca n't talk to you now .

alan , i want to tell you that i 'm so sorry about the ...

we should take it with us to signal any planes .

baryonyx ?

obviously a superpredator . suchimimus . that snout .

how would you classify it ?

mr. and mrs. kirby ! if you look out the right you can see ...

i 'm so use to seeing bones . it 's weird to see skin .

the bones will be there when we get back . that 's the nice thing about them . they never run away . and besides , you got me into this . i do n't intend to be alone with these people .

you rented an automated litter box .

when i met you , i thought that one day millions of years ago , all the dinosaurs became extinct . wiped out . but you told me otherwise . when conditions changed , dinosaurs changed . they became other things . they evolved .

i 'd better get going .

the last of my breed .

anything good ?

the population will stabilize eventually . they 'll adapt to fit different roles .

but then you never get to go in space .

closer you get to the water , the bigger things get .

why ?

i dunno . i mean , it was kind of preachy . chaos-this , chaos-that . and like , to me , the guy seemed kind of high on himself .

what did you think ?

but you never came across just one .

well that 's good .

you can stick with us , or you can go and look for him . either way you 're probably not getting out of here alive .

dr. grant if you 'd just sit tight , we 'll explain this all in a jiffy .

that 's hard to believe .

no , no , see dr. grant , you 're the best . you 've seen these animals in the flesh . no one else has come close to you .

now , for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special , something ...

what can i do for you , mr. kirby ?

it matches the pictures .

how do you mean ?

but alone ? we always had great success together , you and i .

last time i plugged it in , i suppose . why ?

how did you know ?

because i did n't know ! i do n't have the faintest idea what they 're doing here .

it does n't matter what i think .

`` minimal '' is too much . it has to be light , it has to be strong --

minimal .

i 've been putting this together for over a year . i have personal suggestions for your entire team , phone numbers , contact people . they wo n't believe you about what they 're going to see , so do n't bother trying to convince them . just use my checkbook to get them there . i 'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts , as such money and equipment as you need , but only if you leave immediately . if we hesitate , all will be lost .

it would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen .

no , no , no , no , no , no . . .

what are you talking about ?

resentful .

everyone , keep your voices down !

we 've got to see one to find out . is there any --

why would n't they ? look at hyenas , jackals , nearly all species of predator birds --

come on !

dad !

because you said so . maybe nobody else believed you , but i always did .

i do n't care about the trials , i want to be with you . i could be your research assistant , like i was in austin .

that richard .

well , is he ?

which one ?

i do n't even know this woman .

kelly ! what are you doing here ?

let it go , peter . the animal won .

the radio rig is inside . it runs directly from the geothermal generator , so power should n't be a problem .

the velociraptors .

you rally think this 'll draw the parent ?

where do you think you 're going ? !

what ? why ?

cancel that , dieter .

piss .

it was a payoff and an insult . ingen never --

you cost me my livelihood . that on which i relied to support my children .

oh , god .

i have to find kelly !

head for the roof !

no .

what do you think they want ? !

no ! get in the car before they hear us !

no way .

she 's nuts .

now 's the perfect time . the animal just fed , so it wo n't stalk us for food . predators do n't hurt when they 're not hungry .

you remember that guy , about twenty years ago , i forget his name , but he climbed everest without any oxygen , came down almost dead . and they asked him , `` why did you go up there to die ? '' and he said `` i did n't . i went up there to live . ''

but why ?

why should they ?

feeling a bit blue , are we ?

what ?

ian . it 's guano .

ian , they will misplace our evidence , shoot holes in our testimony , and say some special effects genius created the animals . the only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a t-rex in the middle of times square .

all right . i 'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now . i feel vindicated . john hammond will too . do you have enough to publish ?

current evidence seems to be to the contrary , would n't you say ? ! give it to them !

funded by whom ?

no ! we 're an independently funded expedition .

no .

that little black line ?

ian , nothing we observe will be valid if we 're trailing along in the wake of an army .

ian , if we recall the boat now , we 've made two invasive landings in one day . that 'll have to go in any paper i write , and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated . you know the academic world as well as i do , once they smell blood in the water , you 're dead . our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic . that means if we bend a blade of grass , we bend it right back the way it-

the kid scores with cheap sentiment .

very noble of you . you do n't think you 're bringing that thing onto the island , do you ?

that must be interesting . what drew you there ?

i was a cameraman for nightline for six years , been freelance since '91 . do a lot of work for greenpeace .

runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait .

ask her .

move where ? our boat 's not coming for two days , your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --

if we ca n't stay in the rex 's territory , we have to move tonight .

none of that matters . our communications equipment 's been destroyed . if your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff , and i 'm guessing by the look on his face --

phones are out too .

what now ?

what ?

stop the program ! stop the program !

how would we cut off the lysine ?

two million - - great . that would help . oh good , that 'll take no time .

what ? no menthol ?

please - - let 's hear something from the others . dr. grant ? i am sorry - - dr. sattler ?

i 'll catch up with you . you can go with the others .

are you sure ?

yes . we know they 're toxic , but the animals do n't eat them .

they are ? i 'll be damned .

imbalance , disorientation , labored breathing . seems to happen about every six weeks or so .

okay , i 'm following the tubing . i 'm going down a passage way . how long does this stuff go for ? could you guys talk a little bit to me ?

john ... .

this is just a delay , that 's all this is . all major theme parks have had delays . when they opened disneyland in 1956 , nothing worked , nothing .

john , john . john , you 're still building onto that flea circus , that illusion . and now you 're adding onto it by what you 're doing here . that 's the illusion .

a carousel - - and a seesaw . they all moved , motorized of course , but people would swear they could see the fleas . `` i see the fleas , mummy ! ca n't you see the fleas ? '' clown fleas , high wire fleas , fleas on parade ...

malcolm 's okay for now . i gave him a shot of morphine .

give time , they 'll out draw the t-rex . guarantee it .

did i say jerk ?

you ca n't hold it by yourself !

i 'll just finish . yeah , i want to finish .

are you sure ?

- - the undigested state of the berries because it 's - -

not just every six weeks .

we 're out of a job .

we were right !

you 've got a t-rex ! ? he 's got a t-rex ! a t-rex ! he said he's- -

the - - agility . you 're right !

small versions of adults , honey .

sattler .

oh my god , they do not ! they do n't smell .

oh , ellie , look . they 're noisy , they 're messy , they 're sticky , they 're expensive .

like hell it is !

because we 're being hunted . from the bushes straight ahead .

why not ?

i can see the shed from here ! we can make it if we run !

okay .

they show extreme intelligence , even problem solving . especially the big one . we bred eight originally , but when she came in , she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others . that one - -when she looks at you , you can see she 's thinking working things out . she 's the reason we have to feed 'em like this . she had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came .

that 'll - it 'd be a first ; man and dinosaur all die together . john 's plan .

please - - chance it .

you see ? the tyrannosaur does n't obey set patterns or park schedules . it 's the essence of chaos .

anti-nature .

and scary .

i know , it 's very exciting .

because he 's like me . he 's a digger .

why not ?

if two experts sign off on the island , the insurance guys 'll back off . i already got ian malcolm , but they think he 's too trendy . they want alan grant .

hammond hates inspections . they slow everything down .

hola , bienvenido

hey ! where are the brakes ?

let 's get something straight , john . this is not a weekend excursion , this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island . your investors , whom i represent , are deeply concerned . forty-eight hours from now , if they - - - -are n't convinced . i 'm not convinced . and i can shut you down john .

tim , you 're going to have to let go of the fence . tim ! get down right now . get off the fence ! now !

i ca n't ! i 'm scared !

but - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls .

a do-you-think-he-saurus rex .

a do-you-think-he-saurus . what do you call a blind dinosaur 's dog ?

straight-a brainiac !

you 'll probably be safe enough on your own --

so am i going to help you with your foot ?

it 's just like coming out of a tree house . did your dad ever build you a tree house , tim , eh ?

are you okay ? can you move ? tim ! are you okay ?

these look kind of familiar .

listen , ahh - -

when you got ta go , you got ta go .

i know .

yeah , they hate me .

machines hate you ?

blood temperature feels like high eighties .

we clocked the t-rex at thirty-two miles an hour .

i could compensate you by fully funding your dig

well , it 's - - right up your alley . look , why do n't you both come on down for the weekend . love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well . i 've got a jet standing by at choteau .

not to put a fine point on it , your kind . let 's face it , in your particular field , you 're the top minds . if i could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know , give a wee testimonial - - i could get back on schedule - - - -schedule .

what kind of opinions ?

well , i 'm afraid i do . there 's one , a particular pebble in my shoe . he represents my investors . he says they insist on outside opinions .

for today , i guarantee it .

timmy ! the power is coming down , quick !

okay . keep low . follow me .

watch how it eats !

let 's get you out .

tim ! lex !

there 's nothing that great about discovery . what 's so great about discovery ? it 's a violent , penetrative act that scars what it explores . what you call discovery i call the rape of the natural world !

hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam . dinosaurs had their shot . nature selected them for extinction .

alright donald , alright , but just let him talk . i want to hear all viewpoints . i truly do . i truly am .

john , john .

i will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you , dennis . i really will not .

that 's what i said ! you 're a nerd ! they do n't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds !

why did you do this ?

fifty .

i want to look at the rest of the house .

there does n't seem to be any water damage . kind of cozy , actually .

you learn something new every day . let 's go .

great .

okay ... well ... i think it 's this way ...

that 's not true ...

and do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks crystal lake is filled with corpses ?

janet , goddamnit , what 's going on ?

oh my god ... this is his house ... _we 're in his fucking house_ ...

who is this ? what 's going on ?

it 's still on .

ruby , come on . you witnessed a brutal triple murder and you 're having trouble accepting it . think about what you 're saying . you really expect a jury to believe that jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy ?

you 're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part .

and we 're in the center ring . you sure you want to wear that blazer ?

take it easy , ruby ... it 's all right . now , try to think clearly ... do n't you mean _jason's_ hand ... do n't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed doctor layton 's throat ?

jason 's . it came out of his chest ... a hand with long blades on the fingers ...

he does n't look like he 's going anywhere , bill . and if necessary , i can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private .

a house ?

compared to this guy ... amateur .

i thought that was ted bundy .

your ... client is being booked right now . he 'll be in cell five .

three . where 's my client ?

this is a legitimate cinematic genre . just like westerns , comedies , film noire , science fiction ...

i do n't know if anything 's going to work in this case . therefore , we have to try everything .

now ... i think the video store 's open for another couple of hours . let 's go .

it 's all right . now ... we 're going to need a really good head-doctor for this . someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years ... we 'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who 's willing to testify for us .

sorry .

i think it 's our best bet . they 're taking apart his house right now ... they found weapons , blood , a mountain of evidence . we ca n't say he was framed .

are you going to plead insanity ?

for the moment ! you 've only got about two minutes left ! hurry ! ruby takes off towards the cineplex ...

let 's split up . you take the left side , i 'll take the right . we 'll meet in front of the cineplex .

about ten minutes .

what 's that ?

i used to go hunting with my father when i was a kid .

you know how to use one of those ?

it was krueger , was n't it ?

not yet .

i do n't suppose i can go back to the university and chase young coeds again ... pretend this whole thing never happened ...

so what do we do ?

that does n't make sense .

it 's as though there were two people in that room ... both of them asleep ... both of them dreaming .

_it 's a second rem pattern_ .

yeah , what is it ?

do n't you see ? jason was _asleep_ . and he was dreaming -- the rem patterns prove that . and i saw finger blades just like krueger 's come out of jason 's chest . there has to be a connection .

uh-huh ...

how long will he need to be asleep ?

how do we prove it ?

not guilty by reason of insanity . case closed .

if we could prove that jason suffers from this disorder ... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition ...

it 's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus . the part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive . they did n't know about it back in the sixties . even now , it 's not understood very well .

that 's pretty weird . is it possible for someone to not sleep for months ?

not much here . jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia ... that 's about it .

oh ?

no . you 've told me all i need to know .

none of that 's true ?

i thought she was a killer , too . you know ... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors ... before she was decapitated .

this is bad , joe . the prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists . they 'll argue exactly the opposite . they 'll say he 's just pretending to be catatonic and he 's completely sane .

one of the deputies is pretty cute . i think she likes me .

he wets the bed ?

you have been hearing the sordid side then .

no , no , no -- quite a long time , yes .

my assistants , i presume .

you could say we represent the < u > un < /u > official view of a well-ordered society .

another one ?

will you do me a favor then ?

the castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it 's an escape route . do n't get stuck .

a man must eat -- and drink .

you work in the cemetery .

that would be even worse -- it would be a compromise .

why do you work in that hideous insurance office ? -- dealing with people who fall off ladders . now take me -- i make my living as a stone mason . it 's not my art -- but it 's the < u > tools < /u > of my art . you could be -- a journalist .

the needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man . very good .

i read the one about the penal colony .

-- in magazines nobody reads .

yes .

i 'll commit that to memory .

but < u > i 'm < /u > the messenger . an error like this damages my credibility .

he has it , he just has n't noticed it yet , all right ?

he 's usually in the storage room sorting things out . he ca n't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report .

no , i left it in his office .

i gave it to him yesterday .

and you 're late !

it 's what i 'm paid to do .

you 're just doing your job .

it 's my place to offer advice , not yours -- and by advising the chief clerk of your unpunctuality it 's certainly not my situation that 's compromised , if that 's what you 're implying .

sorry , yes -- well -- thank you , sir .

was there something else ?

well , i --

i did not realize it was obligatory .

you keep too much to yourself -- you 're a lone wolf . it makes me uneasy , and if it makes me uneasy i ca n't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees .

you 've been with the firm for nearly nine years . you 've done your work diligently , there are no complaints on that score . but there 's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly , kafka , we eel your social situation could bear improving .

and burgel is the bringer of messages , is n't he ?

he 's jealous , yes , but < u > that < /u > jealous ? he 's too cautious .

it could n't be for that incident with burgel the other day .

they 're not obliged to tell .

burgel gave me this -- what does it mean ?

yes -- which is why `` quiet , dependable people '' have to take charge of their own lives .

my only concern is the human tribunal . is n't it yours ?

when you only see someone sitting at a desk all day , it 's liable to create a false impression .

he was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the medical records division . apparently one of his claims was relevant .

you strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men . and yet you 're able to remain an outsider . with the concomitant air of ... superiority ?

i 've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from .

you wo n't have any trouble finding it .

there are some people i 'd like you to meet . can you come to the musil district at eight o'clock ?

as long as it 's on their terms . if your work and your private life do n't correspond to their specifications you 're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever .

i suspected that he -- well .

hello again .

one of you must be mistaken .

i know .

that 's not what i call conclusive evidence of an abduction .

... just a perception .

his landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to .

he might have had a drink or two , despite what you think .

would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close ?

engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth .

eight -- and seven months .

did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps ?

wednesday . we left the office together .

still , we 're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings .

you mean you 've actually begun some ?

-- i was just trying to finish some work !

you mean because it 's been a while since there was a sunny day ? what a good detective you are .

the loyal civil servant . i suppose you 'll deny that shortchanging the workers to whom compensation is due is standard company policy .

-- you said so yourself the firm is large and powerful . if the discrepancy really was something big , eduard 's responsibility would still have to be small . no poor young < u > clerk < /u > could find himself in such a fix .

lying in the gutter where they belong .

may i ask where your two warders are ?

you see , kafka , in all cases relating to the factory at orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is , to all intents and purposes , the same authority .

what if i petitioned one of the directors ?

it 's gone out so quickly ?

why would we keep files on < u > dead < /u > employees ? all old files are sent up to the castle . do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records ?

wait a minute . `` raban ? '' where have i heard that name ?

amerika !

ludwig ?

we 've been together too long . his personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa .

and we 're upset too .

it 's not our fault . we 're naturally nervous .

we used to be in the supply section , carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them .

she went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing .

gabriela rossman was here looking for you . do you know her ?

take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig !

am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.ladies and gentlemen ! i am touching the beast !

oh god , it 's that bloody yank !

father ... father !

father !

now look at this fine example of early hindu art ... i do n't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...

no ! do n't !

i 'm not sailing with this thing on board !

we 're leaving .

it 's the same image - kong !

relax ... it was fifteen years ago . i do n't do it now .

i ca n't imagine you crying .

i 'm sorry ...

value ? ... value ?

god , you 're so obnoxious ! our work happens to be of great anthropological value !

holy god ! the mummy walks !

tell me , mr driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down ?

look , i 've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there 's no island like that around here .

native costume ?

pleased to meet you ... hi , bow 's it going ? pleased to meet you ! hi , carl denham ... how 's it going ?

yeah ? ... well , i gave 'em a taste of american lead ... and i do n't see 'em coming back for seconds !

that 's your monkey , denham .

holy shit ! look at the size of that !

what was it , jack ?

did you see her ?

compassion .

yeah .

did he come around often ?

what about him ? yes .

arlyn , just tell me , did jane have a dumper , one of her regular johns ?

oh you 've got to . he does such fun things with imagery . and i 've been reading the fall -- -- the fall by ahlbair camoo -- it 's the same thing , you know the imagery --

mm .

it 's good to see you . well -- could we do it first and then just talk ?

i know : it 's ridiculous . but it 's tearing me up and i do n't know why . and look , all right , i came here did n't i ? and if i have to , i 'll keep coming here , the works , and talk about my mummy and my daddy and i 'll even pay for it , but will you kindly for god 's sakes say something ?

look -- could i use your phone ?

i do n't have to look at anything . i do n't have --

we do n't want to just lock him up ; we want a conviction , we wanted him to do something more .

i 'm sorry , i 'm just frightened . yes .

then it does n't matter what i do any more , does it ?

-- we can talk --

yes -- all right --

can you use these ?

ok .

does n't scare me . i think we could handle it .

no . i was going to come up . i wanted to ask you to marry me .

mm .

mm .

oh . well it was n't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy .

trask said i should move . let 's not make a thing of it .

trask wants to talk with you .

oh zippidy-doo , they 'll find my fingerprints . can i go in ? i need some stuff .

those were police laboratory people , they 've been over the apartment .

you said it was over , right ? you said not to worry any more , all over , right ?

drop it .

hell there 's nothing so mysterious about the square life .

please .

you get the christ out ! you dumb stupid bastard , you do n't know anything , you square , you get out ! i do n't have to show you anything ; you get out !

no .

you 're right , i do n't understand . explain it to me . you were scared . arlyn page , that scared you . well it should ; that 's death . so what did you do , you ran straight for it , death . ligourin kills women .

i do n't get you .

what if i go out on tricks - you wan na come along ? you could sit and read the national geographic .

-- then you do n't need me .

what 's the matter ?

arlyn page .

well what 're you down about ? you mean because you did n't get me there ? you ca n't expect that . i mean frank , yes , he 'd get me there all the time -- but never with a john .

bree -- thanks -- i do n't want to .

oh , do n't be a doo-doo .

you told me what you could . i guess i 'm through with your part of it .

you said you wanted these .

it did n't go anywhere . but that 's not why --

he never told me .

what do you think ?

i go on rounds .

i do n't want you to look up . there 's someone on the skylight .

no thanks .

mm ? oh , he was my old man . we broke up .

-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards .

-- you want to wear women 's clothes , or you get off ripping things --

i have some names the police gave me . frank ligourin . will you tell me what --

most of them .

what ? what do you remember about that -- dumper ?

you remind me of my uncle .

or you 'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean ; another month with the bull-dykes .

will you let me ask you some questions ?

he was a research engineer at the tuscarora laboratories in pennsylvania . he disappeared from there last april . i 've been hired to look for him .

tomorrow . see you tomorrow night .

suppose i meet you there a half hour before .

it probably has the dumper 's name . it might give us some kind of new lead . i want a look at it anyhow .

you were hired to look for tom .

call-girls generally keep a book , you know , a list of their clients . sometimes , if a girl retires , she 'll even sell it worth good money . jane mckenna had a black book ; when she died it was stolen . i 've been after it a long time .

what ?

you said he was no possible connection with tom . the page girl told you that , not tom .

you must be discouraged .

yeah .

well there 's a couple --

then , close the case .

all right , suppose it was n't tom grunemann ; where does that get you ?

goodbye , pete .

have you discussed this with them ?

would you like to know what 's in it ? the report .

ok , a family matter . between the girls . i had two other cows -- -- two other girls besides bree .

i 'd like to make something clear . i do n't go after a girl ; a girl comes to me . her choice . right ?

oh sure they try . the idea of a better life . but they do n't really know much about life : they get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle . the trick . the trick . men in bed . not men in general , not life , not love , not even real sex -- it avoids all that . just the trick , the transaction .

no . she had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient , getting out of the life , devoting herself to an acting career .

did she talk about him to you ?

sounds to me you better shake him again . put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it .

but if cable killed grunemann why would he get you hired to look for grunemann ?

no .

i know tom grunemann .

klute . with a k. k - l - u -

i knew tom never wrote that letter .

unless he was involved with grunemann 's disappearance .

but what reason could he have ? what possible reason ?

thought it might . it 's off an arrest report you typed two years ago . man you wanted samples of everybody .

that 's how the other one died , you know . in the water .

i believed her : the dumper was not tom grunemann .

he 's right you know . waiting for the pusher , she 'd tell you anything .

mr. streiger , speaking frankly -- we 've appreciated the sergeant 's interest you know , all along . here , locally . but new york , that 's - well --

we 'd expect him to work in cooperation with you . he 'd report to each of you and to our company 's new york office , to pete -- pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth , and --

klute offered us his services ; we 've accepted .

private investigation , you mean . yes sir , of course you 're entitled , and there 's some very competent --

trask --

why could n't you ever find out anything from the girl ?

very well , i 'd like to see him if i may .

what does ?

good . i 'll see him in there .

where is the child ?

oh , yes . wo n't you come in .

yes ?

playing .

what do you like best about her ?

oh , sure . here , this can be mommy .

on earth .

show ...

ladies and gentlemen ...

because ... well , that 's what he does . he 's a very powerful man .

no , son , i did n't get fired . i 'll tell you what we 'll do , okay ? how about if we go to a burger king and then we watch a little t.v . and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow . just you and me ... how 'bout that ?

was there apple juice when you were little ?

i guess about the same kind of things you do .

are you going to remarried phyllis ?

wow ! that 's neat . can i sit in it ?

is that really your chair ?

sure .

billy . this is dr. alvarez . she would like to talk to you .

oh ...

is mom ever coming back ?

daddy ?

that 's okay , pal . go back to sleep . it 's very late .

yeah ?

owwww ... you 're hurting me ... you 're hurting me ... i hate you ... i hate you ...

oh , for god 's sake ... here .

no . this is fine . just take a bite , you 'll like it fine .

no i did n't . i hate the brown stuff . it 's gross .

i 'm sorry .

i 'm sorry .

je-sus christ ! i catch all kind of shit at the office because i 'm not pulling my weight because i 'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and --

yeah ?

i 'm sorry , pal , but i had a meeting and --

i 'll call thelma and remind her , okay ? do n't worry .

what about my orange juice ?

you forgot the milk .

when is mommy coming back ?

i see . well , you 'll have to do better than that . do you have any affidavits to support negligence ?

are you introducing the question of negligence here , counselor ?

objection ! i must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness .

because my son is here . and his father is here . as a mother , i do n't want my child to be separated from his father .

yes . i tried to talk to ted -- my ex-husband -- about it , but he would n't listen . he refuses to discuss it in any serious way . i remember one time he said i probably could n't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for billy .

mrs. kramer , did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband ?

the first couple , yes , but after that it became increasingly difficult .

objection !

how long do you plan to live in new york , mrs. kramer ?

and yet you fired him .

look , you do n't understand . i need a job . i 've got a kid and --

yes .

i consider it less my failure than his .

oh ? what do you call it then -- a success ? the marriage ended in divorce .

we were married two years before the baby . and then four very difficult years .

is that ... permanent ?

no .

no .

now then , mrs. kramer , you said you were married seven years . is that correct ?

oh , god ... oh , my god ...

he 's already got one mother , he does n't need two ... he 's yours ... i wo n't fight you for him any more . he 's yours ...

joanna , what the hell is --

goddamnit , joanna . what the --

okay , i 'm here . now why did you --

please , ted . i never would have brought it up if i thought --

ted , all my life i 'd either been somebody 's daughter or somebody 's wife , or somebody else 's mother . then all of a sudden , i was a thirty-two-year-old , highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child . i went to california because that was about as far away as i could get . only ... i guess it was n't far enough . so i started going to a shrink . ted , i 've had time to think . i 've been through some changes . i 've learned a lot about myself .

joanna , i do n't give a --

ted , listen to me ... you and i , we had a really crappy marriage -- look , do n't get so defensive , okay ? it was probably as much my fault as it was yours ... anyway when i left i was really screwed up --

i want my son . i 'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street . i want my son .

watching my son ... ted , i 've been living in new york for the past two months .

yes ... how 's billy ?

hello , ted . you look well .

no ! ... please ... please do n't make me stay ... i swear ... if you do , sooner or later ... maybe tomorrow , maybe next week ... maybe a year from now ... i 'll go right out the window .

i 'm not taking him with me .

that represents a gross billing in excess of two million -- what ? !

i thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the fire and ice account by revlon .

are you firing me , jim ?

that 's my decision , ted and that 's final .

jim , this is garbage . this is n't anything like what we talked to revlon about . none of it . you ca n't --

'night , jim .

jim , i appreciate what you 're saying . i mean it , but i really think joanna 's coming back .

but ... just in case ... i mean , just on the off chance she does n't . what are you going to do about the kid ?

she 'll be back ...

look , ted , i 'm the oldest whore on the beat , okay ? three marriages , two divorces ... you 're gon na be okay .

how should i know ?

what ? ! ?

he wanted to know if i liked fried chicken .

i 've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill .

no . uh , uh . tell him i asked for it friday . i want it friday . period .

we can appeal , but i ca n't guarantee anything .

when joanna -- my ex-wife -- when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage ... well , i guess most of what she said was probably true . there were a lot of things i did n't understand -- a lot of things i would do different if i could . just like i guess there are a lot of things joanna wishes she could change ... but we ca n't . some things , once they are done , ca n't be undone . joanna says she loves billy . i believe she does . so do i. but the way it was explained to me , that 's not the issue . the only thing that 's supposed to matter here is what 's best for billy ... when joanna said why should n't a woman have the same ambitions as a man , i suppose she 's right . but by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex ? i guess i 've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent :

jesus christ . did you have to be so rough on her ?

six years . ever since ted and joanna moved into the building .

no , but --

john , what if she kidnaps him .

any prospects ?

now , i 'd advise you to wait outside . it 'll be eas --

please , thel ...

ah , charley and i are ... well , we 're thinking about ... i mean , actually we 're sort of talking about maybe getting back together .

any day .

sure .

she ever ask about me ?

uh , huh ... she said she had a good job , was playing a lot of tennis . she wanted to know all about billy .

no . i do n't think so .

d'you think you and charley 'll ever get back together again ?

lenox hill . 77th street between park and lex . the emergency number is 327-0800 .

i 'm sure .

you 're on your own , understand ?

got it .

i 've got enough trouble raising my own kid . i do n't need another one . got it ?

what are you going to do ?

no .

joanna said that ?

oh for shit 's sake , ted , you are the most selfish human being i have ever met . no wonder she said you came first , then billy , then , if there was anything left over , she got the scraps .

ted , joanna and i used to talk a lot and ... well , she told me a lot of ... ah , things about the two of you .

ted , do n't be so hostile .

all right , thelma , you want to know what 's going on ? i 'll tell you what 's going on . i 'll tell you exactly what 's going on .

khambas are wild men .

no cried ?

you were a beautiful baby . so calm .

tell me .

i will buy them for you .

here . we 'll collect them .

are you ? of whom ?

not the way to talk to people .

i am sorry , lhamo .

why is it necessary for the chinese to keep so many soldiers in lhasa ?

it depends on the quality . and , that it be indian .

impossible ! you will bring famine down on the people of tibet with these insatiable demands ! more food , the best land for your soldiers to camp .

you must also do something about the public meetings . i see this , memorandum circulating , with tibetan grievances .

soon .

i have a copy for you .

dalai lama .

yes , but they say he did .

with much bloodshed .

yes . most of the chamdo region is now in chinese hands . there is a report from chamdo which makes quite clear that , unless some settlement can soon be reached , communist troops will soon be marching on lhasa .

the united nations voted not to hear our appeal .

and the united nations ? surely ?

the tibetans were introduced as delegates from the `` chinese region of tibet '' . we protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it .

the sera monks have surrendered ?

he has been imprisoned , here in the potala , holiness .

who am i ?

this many ?

how many ?

i miss my brother .

you did . we washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father . that day the father got better . and that day , a pair of crows came to nest in our roof . i just remembered .

i pooped .

me . first break of day .

yes . a cow had died . one night , you stopped all your moving , and i said to your sister , `` his time has come . ''

cow .

oh , no . where will he go ?

you ca n't do anything real until you are dalai lama .

do i have money ?

we are now accused of aiding the rebels . the chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt .

i will alert the chinese delegation . you know , i would never have let you go alone , kundun .

i will not go .

the crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the chinese festivities . many who have been invited to dine with the chinese do not return home .

i ask them to stop , to lay down their guns .

shall we consult the protective deities , holiness ?

has anyone died ?

what is the size of our army , now ?

i shall send a letter to america , to the president , informing him of our problem .

britain chooses not to .

can india help us ?

you are the man who wrote this letter . you are the man who has come back to lead us . you will soon have great responsibilities . you must know what to do .

what can i do ? i am only a boy .

he warned about the future of tibet .

no . this war is almost over .

will we be in this war ?

no . not very big .

is that big ?

please .

please , come in , so cold .

good day .

i leave tomorrow .

is he a bad man ? norbu says he is `` lavish '' and `` willful '' . `` how can he give you monk 's vows if he has not kept them himself ? ''

we have .

these are dangerous times . they want the dalai lama to lead them .

maybe in the next life , the world will not need a dalai lama .

i want to be a shepherd , taking those goats and cows out to the hillside .

you can not .

is that true or pretend ?

things change , kundun .

and after the game , we 're going to trade . you just stay over there , no , there ! , norbu , and i will shoot at you . i want your land . i take it . i am stronger .

it may not be your decision to make .

i do .

tell me .

if we agree that we are part of china , nothing else will matter . not trade , not defense . we will be lost .

taktra rinpoche , i understand there was an attempt on your life .

too young ?

you 're all fuckers . vicious little fuckers .

you ca n't take a cow by eminent domain .

i 'll sue you .

ma'am , how could you not report this ? he puts human life at risk and --

i need to see his habitat .

thank you .

you 're a beautiful woman .

i can arrest you ! !

that < u > sounds < /u > good but underneath it 's hurtful . nightcap ?

< u > bite < /u > < u > my < /u > < u > bishop < /u > .

promise you wo n't kill me , first .

you do n't want to cut me down . 'cause i 'll kill you .

i used to have this recurring nightmare that i was headless .

again . not to be disruptive . do we have a problem with it dying ?

i coulda shot you , you --

i 'm laying a spring trap !

jesus christ ! !

i do < u > not < /u > like you .

no ! ! out !

well , you 've got a croc alright , they 're keystone species .

they have saltwater glands , they can swim across oceans , it 's only a matter of time .

i 'll need any and all topographic studies .

you take care .

where is he ?

can you confirm visually or just radar ?

where ? where ?

you do ?

the more he thrashes , the better .

right .

we both know what they 'll do .

i have enough flaxedil with me to put him out . and i think i know a way to --

'cause he just ate a cow , you stupid --

get the gun .

at school they 'd always say `` go '' first .

he 's gon na live ?

they wo n't . he 's taken human life , the mission will be to put him down .

could we have intercourse ?

yes . you may . but maybe ... i do n't know ...

i 'm no psychiatrist . but i would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy , than --

hector . what you just did ... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on .

he was an indo-pacific .

what ? oh as < u > if < /u > i 'm interested .

i 'm just saying last resort .

'cept he was n't before , was he ? you know , when friends or family members say things , they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger . you 're fat .

but they 're nighttime hunters , hector , he 'd probably be on land now anyway .

likewise .

well ...

you wan na kill yourself , that it , you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide ?

what ?

< u > calm < /u > < u > down < /u > .

< u > that < /u > < u > is < /u > < u > it < /u > ! !

maybe . do n't mush it .

ssssh !

night .

thanks for the ... bandaid .

maybe . i 've always < u > read < /u > about what 's happened . i 've never ... i know it sounds silly but , it 's nice to be someplace < u > while < /u > something is actually ... y'know ... happening .

father 's a surgeon . i can even stitch in a pinch , would n't be a bad idea here .

who taught you be be a nurse ?

i could n't believe ... did you see the size of that thing 's mouth ?

yeah . i got some stuff for your cut .

like little children . you okay ?

police want to keep it quiet , if the press gets word ... lake monster . they just want us to sit tight .

no . u.s. wildlife is on their way .

good .

i 'm sorry but you 're ...

i did n't fly up here to roast marshmallows --

listen , uh ... hank and i think it best if you stay on shore .

skipping stones . look how flat that water is , you can get ten skips on a good one .

i 'd be able to see something .

well . you do n't have to < u > stay < /u > out < u > here < /u > , why do n't --

you do n't like tents , mosquitos , look at your fingernails , you have about as much business being in the woods --

so i do n't like tents , why --

the museum of natural history does n't send out investigators to --

why are you here ? really .

excuse me . one other thing , it 's a < u > small < /u > point , but ... i have a thing about being humored , and i 'm feeling humored , more by < u > him < /u > , but you seemed quick to join in .

yes , it < u > did < /u > seem prehistoric but i 'm sure he just carried the thing for luck . not that it < u > worked < /u > , obviously . it probably somehow got lodged into his body .

get back from the shore . we know how fast he can leap out .

let 's go .

we set ?

i do n't know . back the truck --

he said he knew karate !

hank ?

< u > that < /u > was a bust .

what is this ?

he said he knew it when he looked into their eyes .

is this 'spose to make me take him more serious ?

you hurt his feelings . i think you should go apologize .

thank you , it 's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you , you fucker .

they do n't believe her .

crocodiles . he 's an expert on them . and if he 's < u > here < /u > ... then he must think that 's what 's in this lake .

what ?

sheriff .

ever even been < u > in < /u > one ?

< u > we < /u > ?

and this is how he came to the boat ?

seconds . three , four .

i can look at dead things .

this is a little different .

i would n't .

i never do field work and even if i did , < u > maine < /u > , to look at a tooth of a < u > dinosaur < /u > who bit somebody , could n't you dream up something --

kevin . how 's it going , what 's happenin ' , family good , great , nice to catch up , get out .

< u > oh < /u > ... no , no , i 'm not angry i 'm not , i 'm just thrown , i 'm ... i actually have an early lunch , so ...

a jerk .

else .

i had a great time last night . again .

shitbutt ?

myra .

backstabber ?

you and kevin .

agent starling ! telephone !

fredrica bimmel , from belvedere , ohio . the first girl taken , but the third body found ... why ?

the worst part - the thing that 's making me crazy - is that bill is right in front of me . only i ca n't see him ... lecter said , everything i need to catch him is right here , in these pages ...

clarice - you did the best anybody could have for catherine martin . you stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried . it 's not your fault it ended this way .

no . he wo n't come after me .

somebody 's coaching her ... they 're trying to make him see catherine as a person - not just an object .

boy , is that smart ...

listen , i hope you never need a thing i 've taught you . but you 've got something ... jack sees it , i do too . if you ever need to , you can shoot .

get your field gear , take stuff for overnight . you 're goin ' with crawford .

i 'll get you out ! just be quiet so i can hear . shut that dog up . is there a ladder ? is there a rope ?

you 're all right ! where is he ?

he 's my patient ! i have rights ! i 'm not just some turnkey , miss starling . i should n't even be here this afternoon . i had a ticket to holiday on ice .

you might have suggested that in my office , and saved me the time .

dr. chilton - if lecter feels you 're his enemy - as you 've said - then maybe i 'll have more luck by myself . what do you think ?

i 'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions ... on the afternoon of july 8 , 1981 , he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary . his mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an ekg . when the nurse bent over him , he did this to her ...

do not reach through the bars , do not touch the bars . you pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils . no staples or paperclips in his paper . use the sliding food carrier , no exceptions . do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you . do you understand me ?

lecter carved up nine people - that we 're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits . we 've tried to study him , of course - but he 's much too sophisticated for the standard tests . and my , does he hate us ! thinks i 'm his nemesis ... crawford 's very clever , is n't he ? using you .

i see . let 's make this quick , then . i 'm busy .

the market in lecter hints is way down , today , okay ? i 've got two good men dead in memphis , and three civilians . i 've got -

but then he had to cover up , make her seem just like all the rest of them . that 's what lecter was hinting !

mr. krendler ... dr. lecter trusts me . or at least , he used to . if i could just -

i need the id to fly with my gun . the gun belongs in quantico .

mr. yow ? oh mr. yow ... ? it looks like somebody is sitting in this car .

that was n't me .

good idea .

mr. yow , if this door should fall down -ha ha ! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number ? it 's our baltimore field office . they know you 're here with me ... do you understand ?

i wo n't disturb anything , mr. yow , i promise . be gone before you know it .

are they close to catching somebody , do you think ?

chicago 's only about 400 miles from here . i could be there in -

this gumb 's a real beauty . slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve , and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric . where , starling , he took vocational rehab , and learned a useful trade ...

ohio is cold ground . picked over , ten months ago . our people worked it , so did the locals .

or just as worthless . but i want you in memphis , close to him . maybe when he gets tired of toying with senator martin , he 'll talk to you again . there 's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip .

you 'll back me up with some paperwork ? then i 'll try . but would n't this have more weight coming from the senator herself ?

if we act too anxious , he 'll make us wait . he 'll let the senator keep hoping , day after day , until catherine finally washes up . that 'd be the most fun of all .

you seem pretty sure of that .

when i told that sheriff we should n't talk in front of a woman , that really burned you , did n't it ? that was just smoke , starling , i had to get rid of him . you did well in there .

are you finished ?

maybe you 've got a knack for this ... i guess we 're about to find out .

you do n't have to feel any way about it . lecter did it to amuse himself . why not , what can they do ? take away his books for awhile , and no jello ... i know it got ugly today . but this is your report , starling - take it as far as you can . on your own time , outside of class . now carry on .

the orderly heard lecter whispering to him , all afternoon , and miggs crying . they found him at bed check . he 'd swallowed his own tongue ... chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit , and he 's trying to blame it on you . i told the little prick your conduct was flawless . starling ... ?

well ? why are n't you there right now ?

right down to the kleenex i used . sir , why ? is something wrong ?

the psychiatrist - dr. hannibal lecter .

you see , the one we want most refuses to cooperate . i want you to go after him again today , in the asylum .

i try to be a student , dr. pilcher .

she died . she went to florida to retire , like two years ago ? she dies own there .

your lambs are still for now , clarice , but not forever ... you 'll have to earn it again and again , this blessed silence . because it 's the plight that drives you , and the plight will never end .

well , clarice , have the lambs stopped screaming ... ?

yes . i 'll tell you .

tell me his name , dr. lecter .

thank you , clarice .

do you think if you saved catherine , you could make them stop ... ? do you think , if catherine lives , you wo n't wake up in the dark , ever again , to the screaming of the lambs ? do you ... ?

you still wake up sometimes , do n't you ? wake up in the dark , with the lambs screaming ?

but what became of your lamb ? clarice ... ?

yes ... ! they were screaming .

early . still dark .

we do n't reckon time the same way , clarice . this is all the time you 'll ever have .

what is the first and principal thing he does , what need does he serve by killing ?

no ! that 's incidental .

first principles , clarice . simplicity . read marcus aurelius . of each particular thing , ask : what is it , in itself , what is its nature ... ? what does he do , this man you seek ?

then tell me how .

i 've studied the case file , have you ... ? everything you need to find him is right in these pages . whatever his name is .

dr. lecter , you find out everything . you could n't have talked with this `` william rubin '' , even once , and come out knowing so little about him ... you made him up , did n't you ?

no .

i went to live with my mother 's cousin and her husband in montana . they had a ranch .

quid pro quo , doctor .

yes .

i was your choice , dr. lecter . you chose to speak to me . would you prefer someone else now ? or perhaps you do n't think you can help us .

or does n't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of ... negotiation ? there 's something crawford can give me , and i want to trade for it . i even wrote to him , offering my help . but he hates me , so he wo n't deal directly .

scared , at first . then - exhilarated .

i might if i saw the case file . you could get that for me .

how did - it 's nothing . a scratch .

your bleeding has stopped .

reasonably so . yes .

do you know why he 's called buffalo bill ? tell me . the newspapers wo n't say .

no , i came because we need -

dr. lecter , if you 'd please consider -

did you do those drawings , doctor ?

jack crawford sent a trainee to me ?

`` we '' being the behavioral science unit , at quantico . you 're one of jack crawford 's , i expect .

i doubt very much that the fbi or any other government agency can keep a secret , mr. crawford . truth will out ... and then what ? will you give johns hopkins a new identity ? put a big pair of sunglasses on this building , and a funny nose ?

oh , and senator ... ? love you suit .

what ... ?

i 'm the one who found his perforating proboscis ! are you wearing a gun , right now ? ooh , cool ! can i see it ? can i ?

time , pilch ! my move .

and my compliments to you ...

listen . submit . you hear me ? you 're strong . you stay alive . i will find you ... no matter how far , how long it takes ...

what is it ?

no . i will find you .

webb 's reinforcements will arrive or not . if they do not arrive , the fort will fall . if that happens , stay close to your father . the french will protect the officer class among the english .

'cos frontier land 's the only land affordable to poor people . so after seven years indentured service in virginia , they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin ' by another 's leave ... their name was cameron . john & alexandria .

the bible . monarchy . many wrong ideas about the government of men . my father 's people already know each man is his own nation . and only he can have dominion over himself . not kings . no man is better than any other man .

and what were the consequentialities of european culture you did n't bother with ?

the ottawa are gone .

he did ?

chingachgook . he warned me about people like you .

anyone lookin ' to pick up our trail , would see it as a sign of our passing ...

why did n't you bury those people ?

i will not . i have seen the face of war before , mr. poe , but never war made on women and children . and almost as cruel is your indifference .

but the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon .

the man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room , in my presence . he is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal , regardless of what he did for my children .

what are they doing to duncan ? duncan !

what the bloody hell plan is this ?

they do not live their lives `` by your leave . '' ... they hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands , burying their dead and their children along the way .

cora , i adore you and , when we come together , we will be the happiest couple in england ... i am certain of that . more than ever before . i believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts ...

it can be dangerous ...

`` some '' ?

some say that 's the way of it .

you still have an aversion to the water ?

and if we 're unlucky ?

then what ?

this is it , as far as we can go ... if we 're lucky , they 'll be figurin ' we ca n't have come this way and must 've beached our canoes and headed cross land . if we 're very lucky , they 'll figure we went over the falls .

where do we go from here ?

that is the truth !

ottawa !

do not let gratitude get in the way ...

england does not protect me and does not war against france on our account . she uses us to war against france on her own account ... of greed for land and furs .

then you are one of those who would allow england to fight alone while she protects you from france ?

i ai n't your `` scout '' . and i am in no damn militia .

fort edward , then ?

came across the war party , tracked 'em .

miss cora munro . he never set eyes on her before today .

... no ... do not call myself much of a subject at all .

you , sir ! you call yourself a loyal subject ?

will you men help us stop the french ?

first place , you started it with the french over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the ohio . now you 're sayin ' these people have a fight on their hands ...

what did you say ?

out the northern sally-port . strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the french picket line . head north over the ridge , then come about southeast and fork left in little meadow and you 're free of the outpost and skirmishers ...

that we did . john . but the horicane is near trapped out .

would the huron make his algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man ? would the huron have greed for more land than a man can use ? like francais black robes do ? would huron kill tribes with disease ? would the huron fool seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy ? but sell the fur to the white man for gold ? ... those are the ways of yengeese and les francais masters . are they the ways of huron men who hunt & work the land ? or of dogs ? ... magua 's heart is twisted . he would make himself into what twisted him . a dog , become master of dogs . but are hurons dogs ? ... magua 's way is false . it is like the white sickness . magua 's way will bring only sadness and shame . is there another way ? i do n't know . i am nathaniel of the yengeese ; hawkeye , adopted son of chingachgook , of the mohican people ... let the children of the dead munro go free ... i speak the truth .

the red man put down the bow , picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest . yes . it is the only way .

that judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with webb to defend their farms & families ... major heyward was at john cameron 's . he saw what it was .

yes , mr. poe ? so ?

what else ?

and what is that ?

and who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon england 's policies in her own colonies ? to come and go without so much as a `` by your leave . ''

logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them . they keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day . his thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range , so when they 're close enough , they 'll move them in , lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust . they look to be three hundred yards out . bloody murderers . you have three days .

sir . webb has no idea . and he certainly does not know to send reinforcements !

fire !

yes sir !

atten-hut !

thank you , sergeant major . thank the men .

shoulder arms ! present !

advance , sergeant major !

does yengeese major have property across salt sea ?

wampum ?

if magua give women to yengeese soldiers ... will receive many gifts .

excuse me . what did you say ?

i judge military matters , captain winthrop , not you .

i must receive proof more conclusive than mr. poe 's opinion before i weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw .

that 's where a lead bullet has torn you .

that le renard has the power to lead his people into the light , i know well .

carry them to england to your king with pride .

the honors of war ?

such as ... ?

and i to make yours , monsieur le marquis .

il est necessaire d'etre vigilant , mon enfant .

c'est bien , vous vous promenez bien matin , monsieur !

intelligence may not be the right word ...

why stop with just one aspect of marine life ? why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer ? ...

some say that 's why we 're basically hairless , for less water resistance , faster swimming speeds ...

it was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water . most homo sapiens did n't make it ... danakil man ... < u > adapted < /u > .

yeah ... right ...

it could be a million things , something in the air , food ... . but he went on that ship and so did williams ... i want to examine the crew .

i do n't know . i 've been back and forth with narragansett naval all day , consulting with the best people in maritime medicine , the best people in viruses ...

for this ... you do n't need to be .

dead ? this morning you said he had some skin disorder .

pretty good imitation of a hangover and i ought to know .

just get in yours !

no way ...

that 's why there 's a dead one on the ship . it ran out of blood .

one of those chunks of sixpack ! like a big leech , with those teeth ! ...

there 's now a problem with the weather for pickup . there 's a typhoon in our sector ... ... we 're going to be delayed twelve hours ...

we 're getting out of here just in time .

bullshit ... i was just talking to him . i saw him move .

uh , oh ... i see where this is going ...

it hit me ! where are they ? !

our only chance is to lure it to the swamp and flush it like we did the other .

what can we do ?

you think i should hang around more with the crew ?

has it helped ?

everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line . sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something .

still ... you did the right thing .

shut up , all of you .

is this a contract violation , mr. cobb ?

excuse me , sir ...

all right ...

you 're only twenty-five tons off quota . barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day . it 's just a day off . you do n't have to take it , i just thought it might help .

he 's not at his station .

twenty minutes ...

charge set ?

let 's get it out of here and bring in a new one .

okay , number 23 's full .

what you do n't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy .

i know that .

timex ...

you got money in this tub ?

not yet .

made your million , yet ?

hey , bo ... when 're you going to be off that thing ? i want to find out tonight 's nba scores and check the weather .

fuck the suits , it 's the people monitoring them . it doc had been there like he 's supposed to it never would 've happened !

what the ? ...

oooooh . damn ! not so loud . turn down the music .

ah , it 's just old , like me . you do n't see the doc opening me up every time i get a new creak in my joints ... i say , as long as it 's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it . but , 'long as we 're here ...

listen to it for christsake .

probably the plumbing . you gon na make me finish that puzzle by myself , or what ?

getting some food .

what ? that ? ... i 've done this one before . you hungry ? i 'm hungry .

'fucker could have gotten us all killed .

serves his ass right to get it . motherfucker brings that shit onboard . i hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish .

twelve hours !

burritos ... enchiladas ...

yes sir , ai n't that where we usually go when we 're sick ?

answer them and quit kicking me !

well , why have n't they answered our flares ?

do n't fuckin ' worry , i ai n't .

the air 's stopped .

what is it ?

i ought to smack your face !

sleeping . no sign of doc , though . i 'll check the control room . you look in the shower room ...

who were you talking to ?

your pocket ?

my pocket . check my pocket , will ya , honey ?

well not exactly , no ; i got 'em sitting in the car , actually ; i thought we might sell them back to the greek , but i am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him .

a what ?

seven hundred for the pair .

well , it 's still a good idea .

probably no longer than four weeks .

stop fucking around , tom , and think . what are we going to do ?

i 'll kill him !

yeah , but he has got to tell his dad he is about to lose his bar .

i would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse . the odds are a hundred to one for a good reason , bacon . . . it wo n't win . so where is ed with all the bright ideas ?

the traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear . they got no case against us because there is no evidence against us .

well what ?

that inspires confidence , that does .

i dunno , but i do n't think we need him . dump him at the lights .

they ca n't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked , can they ?

i do n't know how you 've reached that conclusion .

and nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to ; a bit anti-social , you know .

hatchet has a colleague , a monster of a man : barry the baptist .

the reason he is called bacon is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them . but he is a big boy now and it is time to move on .

a cocktail , you asked for a cocktail .

i am not fucking interested .

where 're the others ?

if it looks old , it 's worth money , simple . so stop fucking moaning and rob the place .

like what ?

and jd is his dad , and owns the whole property ?

nope .

jd .

the boys had 'em . i know you like these things ; wondered if you wanted them ?

no harry , you ca n't .

i wo n't be seeing you again chris ; i have paid him every last penny .

i 'll have it for mr harry in a few days . i have been busy , and i am nearly there .

what are you doing ?

well , put your seatbelt on then .

let 's have a look , shall we ?

how long has he been in there , son ?

not likely i am afraid ; i do n't think i 'll be seeing them again .

what can i do for you ?

listen , i do n't care who lives in there ; all as i know it 's got to be preferable to death by hatchet .

this is dangerous shit , dean ; we do n't even know who lives in there .

that was hatchet horrible harry .

it just cost me fifty quid to have this done . if you think i am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you 're mistaken , kenny .

what is the point in that ? even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em .

how about you ? all right ?

my neck , dog . that 's the last bag ?

who are you going to kill plank ? there 's no one there .

do n't you stags move or i 'll kill the lot of ya .

there 's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it .

plank ?

i mean it , there is only three of us here .

do you want me to take his leg off ? where 's the fourth ?

what the fuck is going on ?

willy , this is the last time , and do n't let him know that you 're here , otherwise he will be here all day , and get rid of him quick . we have work to do .

samoan jo 's ? yon mean the pub ? hold on . . .

well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the queen on it . will that do ?

invitations ?

tom , go and throw those guns off a bridge .

i do n't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid .

listen , if he has the guns he might have the money . . . i think we should go and see him .

you what ? what are you on about ?

you think it 's a good idea taking it back to yours ?

why not ? the whole of the british empire was built on cups of tea .

what do you mean , me ?

everything all right out there , tom ?

er , let me guess , my foot in your arse ? a game of cards and hatchet harry . you 're supposed to be getting some rest , boy !

i wanted to talk to you about that .

it 's ed , if that 's what you mean .

well , you 're going to have a problem carrying on , aintcha .

i am not interested in what you would rather ; i want to keep going . i am also offering you the money , so we do n't have to turn them over because you can borrow .

you will what ?

i will .

that is quite a raise , one hundred and fifty on my hundred .

a hundred grand .

harry , that boy does n't know his arsehole from his ear-hole , or you from a hoodwink . this bar is mine , and he has nothing to do with it .

and ?

i like your bar .

i know . now shut it . you say a fucking word the right knee goes , another word then your left .

look , could you just open the door so i could talk without shouting ?

no , i 'm afraid he 's not . he 's out at the moment .

all right , let 's forget about them for the time being . what about your weed man ?

i got contacts . listen tom , if you pointed them at me i 'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do . either way you still get the desired effect .

jesus , if i pick them up , will they stay in one piece ? where did you get them from ?

does n't sound very good to me .

you know it does n't include the amp .

how much did you say it was , tom ?

of course you are . all right , ed .

so i 've just got to put you in , and i am off .

so ?

my van is half full .

you 've already been fifteen .

how many wings have they got between them ?

six .

nick the greek .

it 's the mother of fuck-ups , stupid !

if you will order stuff that comes from kat-man-fucking-du do n't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route . ~ never mind that , what about the money ?

cupid stupid ! that 's the last time i am getting any more fruit off you tom . call that fresh ? there was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit . you should open a butcher 's , not a grocer 's .

what do you mean ?

you went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer . alarm bells are ringing , willy .

it 's pathetic . you ca n't be desperately in love when you 're 14 years old .

and those stupid girls who hang out with them --

it 's my life . if i want to fuck it up , that 's my business .

you think i ca n't learn that ?

you can fix old cars . mr. washburn told me that the cars they 're making now are all computerized --

i can fix cars .

how do you think you 're going to make a living ?

-- you 're going to be on your own .

oh , come on , amado --

i do n't know what the big deal is .

any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers ?

why do you think they let us in on the `` deal '' ?

chaos .

work hard , be good at your job . sir . do whatever they tell you .

how do you think i got to be a colonel ?

what exactly do you think your job is , private ?

do you believe in what we 're doing here , private johnson ?

thank you , sergeant major .

you and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals . put it in gear .

report to dr. innis at the clinic .

sergeant ?

what i will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end . you know how the press is with a murder story -- even if it 's forty years old .

you got to investigate . no question about it .

if it was some poor mojado , swam across at night , got lost in the scrub and starved out there , we would n't go any further . but this is a formerly prominent citizen .

skull was intact , no soft tissue left -- not much to go on .

everybody on the border knows that story .

gon na pull a lot of jobs out of this county .

sam the man .

you ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye ?

you do whatever i say you do or else you put it on the trail , son .

you feeling bad for jimmy ? have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side . those old boys in ciudad leon --

there 's gon na be some left over for you , buddy . i take care of my boys .

what 's that for ?

350 pounds .

no , it was n't , was it ? you did n't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul , did you ?

you did n't -- uhm -- you did n't have one of your fires , did you ? the stuff i left in the garage -- some of it was my father 's --

no . you ?

daddy hired a pinhead to take your job . he says so himself . says `` even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead i got now '' .

you look awful good in that uniform , though .

same weight i always was .

daddy calls it an `` altercation . '' how you doing , sam ? you look skinny .

-- they had n't pulled me off that woman i would have jerked a knot in her .

last year was awful rough -- mama passing on and the whole business with o.j. -- i mean it 's not like it was don meredith or roger staubach or one of our own boys , but it really knocked me for a loop --

you 've been in this house for a while ?

if it 's too late --

so that 's him --

you 'll get official notification when i make my decision . he is out the door -- otis pulls himself a beer as carolyn steps back out --

so how come you got into all this ?

when you 're his age you 'll still be pissed off about him .

he 's a pretty tough old man , huh ?

they were in the army . like your father .

same as they done in mexico .

they fought against the indians ?

they teaching that now ? good . only a couple of 'em held out -- this man , john horse , and his friend wild cat , and a fella name of osceola . army put all of them in prison and osceola died , but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten , fifteen years . beat zach taylor and a thousand troops at lake okeechobee .

he a black man or an indian ?

are we going to ever see your father ?

you would n't ?

so you 're going into the army ?

dad , can i talk to you about track ?

hey , mikey --

always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice . but marriage , man -- i did two tours in southeast asia and i was married for five years -- i could n't tell you which experience was worse .

maybe .

cliff --

it 's not just cactus . there 's the nopals , the yuccas --

i 'd quit the army for you , if it came to that .

it 's up or out these days , cliff . say i get transferred to a different post --

so where does that put us ?

you spoil 'em , cliff .

pleased to meet you .

sheriff -- hi -- this is sergeant -- this is priscilla worth .

that ring --

-- warning . not 'cause he had it in for the colored

you mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors , you be out of a job .

i meant on the post . in general . how are you dealing with it ?

because i 'm your father .

why would you want to do that ?

well , you 're the man out there now , are n't you ? it 's your call .

nice to meet you , ma'am .

this here 's carolyn . honey , this is my son , delmore .

it 's a bar . people come together , drink , fall in love , fall out of love , air their grudges out --

bandidos , injuns --

this same person been bragging all over the county how he do n't have to cut that big gringo sheriff in on it -- he can run his own operation 'thout any help . como se llama , amigo ?

i heard somebody been haulin ' wets on this road .

no hay de que . tengo otra . [ no problem , i 've got another . ]

mercedes gonzales ruiz .

i thought you were married !

es mi novia . [ she 's my girlfriend . ]

we was by the river ? and i hear my friend callin ' for help , and i look and she has falling in the water --

in english , enrique . we 're in the united states --

hay pasado un accidente muy grave -- [ there 's been a bad accident -- ]

buenas noches , senora cruz . enrique walks in the opposite direction --

-- but buddy deeds was my salvation .

your mother was a saint .

charley wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground , and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him .

better late than never . korean war hero , sheriff for near thirty years -- buddy deeds memorial p --

big day coming up -- i wish we 'd have thought of it while he was still living . but he went so unexpected .

he known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up . `` old fishbait , '' he says , `` never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it . ''

we need a drug rehab program , we need a new elementary school --

we do n't need a new jail .

word gets out who that body was , people are gon na think buddy done it .

widow 's benefits . he figured it would make the disappearance look better , and that mexican gal was just scrapin ' by after charley killed her man . they did n't get hooked up till late --

and the ten thousand ?

i think somewhere between roderick bledsoe 's club and his house , wade ran into buddy deeds . i think buddy put a bullet in him , waited for him to die , threw him in the trunk of the sheriff 's car and drove him out by the army post , i think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back .

i got an idea what happened .

besides my father , i mean .

forensics people are sure of it . you have any idea who might have put him there ?

bledso

no .

you go by your old house ?

sam ! hey podner ! you caught me playing hooky --

i always wondered what you mayors do when you 're not cutting ribbons .

not a peep . buddy run the man out of town .

that so ?

there was a mandate in the last election --

danny 's gon na be out for blood the next time .

the perdido thing ?

you got to be interested in somebody . all you do is work .

sure , they go back to cortez . when he rode by , they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner .

what ? become a nun ? you did n't want me going out with anglos --

i never said that .

how come you never got married again ?

you want to see mexicans , open your eyes and look around you . we 're up to our ears in them .

why would i want to go there ?

do you remember the last time you saw him ?

not if they was colored or meskin . not if they wanted to keep breathin ' .

and my father ?

he had the club out on the old trail road --

i 've seen 'em .

you ever play one of these ?

mrs. bledsoe ?

i 'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other -- i should get combat pay --

i do n't think you can take it personally --

yeah . how about that ? people start digging holes in this county , there 's no telling what 'll come up .

i 'm not open . we were just talking .

he ever accept cash for a favor ?

oh , my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys .

nobody really wears that stuff , paloma .

you gon na stay out here ?

yeah ?

what ?

chucho montoya saw it with his own eyes . shot him in cold blood .

you built our patio while you were on the county ?

and your mother was a saint . that summer i built the patio at your house ? she made me lunch every day .

different charge . i had a still . made my own mescal .

i thought he busted you a couple times .

it was for personal consumption .

you stop growing that loco weed at your place , you 'd see a lot more daylight .

three months .

i 've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before . did n't know she owned one .

couple months before i was born --

you gon na tell your mother we been seeing each other ?

what was your father 's name ?

like your story is over .

more , i hope .

we thought we were something , did n't we ?

looks real bad if the teacher 's late for class . it 's really nice to talk with you , sam .

so why did you come back here , sam ?

no --

so she tells me three times a week .

a real palace . she rattles around alone in that thing --

your mother still does n't like me .

are you okay ?

well , it 's a complicated issue --

you 'd do a good job .

the republicans ?

have n't seen much of you at the jail lately .

hospital says the other kid is in bad shape --

this is n't houston , my friend . we pretty much running things now . our good day has come .

what 's this i see ? is that whiskey in them glasses on the bar ? roderick , i 'm gon na have to cite you for a violation of state law --

do n't mind him , sheriff . boy 's just a bit slow , is all . he do n't mean nothin ' by it --

sure .

i heard about that deal for your father -- you must be real proud .

the other one ? hell , at my age , every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one . your head 's all crowded up -- here it is --

your mother was n't one to get chased off her patch . half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein ' it through .

they do n't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole . would you buy this ?

buffalo chips . fella in santa fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out .

you sell much out here ?

how come you do n't took familiar ?

one of cleroe payne 's boys ?

he does n't need to know all my business .

you going to tell him ?

tell him he can keep them . the bellboy looks puzzled .

mister d'amour ?

thanks , billy .

i 'm out of here , man ! are you coming ?

trickery and divinity . yeah , he says that all the time .

what did vinovich say ? something about walking a path between --

a nix specialty ?

that 's butterfield ...

billy ? this was on miller 's forehead . any idea what it is ?

my life was too weird for her .

you heard right .

i hear mrs. swann 's quite a babe .

it 'll be something hokey .

who is he ?

d.a.m.o.u.r . d'amour . harry d'amour .

beats me .

why would i do that ?

it 's an illusion .

what do you mean , `` all of us ? ''

d'amour ... d'amour ... why do i know that name ?

anything ?

i 'll tell you .

i could scoop them out .

what is he ?

if he was just a man like me , then no . but he 's not .

and you think he 'll be in a fit state to resurrect , after thirteen years ?

be ready .

please ... i was n't there ... ask pimm .

ever watched a man die ? if you watch very closely , you can sometimes see the soul escaping . and if you 're very quick , you can catch it .

yes .

harry ...

hang on !

harry ?

and pimm and swann . only nix was ready for them .

and they all came ...

i was so afraid .

nothing ?

you said you were n't with him for love .

jennifer desiderio , for one . she threw herself in front of a car this afternoon .

what did you find ?

i did n't leave . i was just digging around .

okay . i 'll keep digging .

so why did you marry him ?

i went up to the magic castle . you were right . he did n't have a lot of fans up there .

i 'm no bodyguard .

where do i sign ?

we have n't slept in the same bed for years .

what 's the connection ?

nix was never interested in you . it was always swann .

harm to whom ? me ? i do n't think , so . try him again at the hotel .

no word from d'amour ?

i just saw him .

-- vanished .

what makes you so sure ?

tapert 's got nothing to do with this . he came here to get his palm read .

he was a freak . everything he did was tainted .

i 'm not saying another word . you damn fool . he 's a journalist .

you tell me . no ? i thought you 'd maybe have a theory .

i could reproduce any miracle that 's ever been performed , with a little preparation .

i think we walk a narrow path , between ... between ...

we 've got to get you to a hospital .

him too .

why do n't you leave this alone ? let everybody think it 's over ?

nix is dead and buried , for fuck 's sake .

i tried to pay you off .

yes .

yes .

are you satisfied now ?

yeah , i know .

i ca n't let you in .

when will she be in ?

fuck regrettable ! i want to know why .

left alone ? somebody 's been murdered .

a ticket home ,

what for ?

you 're a detective , with no clues . where else are you going to look ? i 'm going to keep this brief . here 's thirty thousand dollars .

i do n't think the dead much care .

what 's the difference ?

are you a gambling man ?

then what do you want ?

shit .

you 're drawn to the dark side , over and over . and it 's drawn to you . you do n't like that .

too late . why are you here ? did you cone ... up here for a reading ?

have you been in ?

are they all in the business ?

people are pretty cagey . who do you know ?

sure . vivovich .

not the walter wilder ?

i 'm in from new york . i came to see swann .

at birth . i do n't know you --

i do n't know .

nobody 's better off this wav !

jesus !

no .

you think i 'm an asshole .

oh jeez .

he deserved it .

illusionists get . las vegas contracts , d'amour . magicians get burned .

they 'll never find out .

what ?

one question .

i got to go . i 'm late .

no . he 's coming back . he 's digging his way out !

is he the puritan ?

who 's not ?

what about philip swann ?

yes .

you could still help me do that .

do n't touch me . he 's got ... got into my head .

so , we got you on an earlier flight , but i really think you should think about staying for that talk show .

yeah , they told me .

i 'll miss you .

why are you crying ?

uh , yeah ... i 'll bring it down .

charlotte ?

i do n't know , it just does n't , reality changes things ... .we ca n't stay here forever , unless maybe we started a jazz band .

i know . but , it does n't last , you have to go back sometime .

i do n't want to go back tomorrow .

i 'm going to miss you .

tomorrow .

a coke .

you ca n't get sushi anywhere in japan after 2 o'clock . did you know that ?

yes , but no , i ca n't right now .

what happened to your toe ?

fuck off .

four .

they really have to work on that street name thing .

why do you have to be with your opposite , why cant similar people be together ?

when they 're born its like vietnam . it 's terrifying .

thanks . it does , the more you know who you are ... you do n't care about things the same way ...

you 're possessive .

oh . well ... they were dancing on the couch with that weird english guy who kept talking about hanging out with the sex pistols on kings road ...

did you see hiromix last night dancing with bambi ?

i do n't know . my fax said `` have a good fright '' .

i know , i kind of blend in here .

i do n't remember .

no , you smiled .

did i scowl at you ?

no , its easy .

hans was very attentive to you .

ok , see you downstairs .

yeah , i 'm going to take a shower and i 'll meet you downstairs .

what do you feel like singing , bob ?

charlie , this is bob . bob charlie brown .

oh , good . do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here ?

not really . how long are you here for ?

no , how about you ?

hi . did you have a nice swim ?

who do i have to fuck to get off this planet ?

hi again , how 's it going ?

thanks .

oh , what do you do with that ?

what did you study ?

i 'm not sure , yet ... i graduated last spring .

what about you ? why are you here ?

my wife needs space , i do n't know my kids ' birthdays . everyone wants tiger woods , but they could get me , so i 'm here doing a whiskey commercial .

my stockings .

can i enter ?

oh ?

mr. kazuzo sent me .

mr. harris ?

ok .

when are you coming home ?

what ?

it 's ok .

i could n't hear you . how are you ?

oh , come on .

fine .

i do n't know ... i want to be more healthy . i want to eat better .

hello , can i have room 5601 .

how do you say `` hospital '' in japanese ?

it 'll just be a few days .

are you sure you want to stay ?

i got ta go ... and i do n't really like champagne .

you do n't have to be embarrassed .

oh ... that 's nothing , someone gave it to me .

its bad for you .

will you please stop smoking ?

i do n't know .

bye .

i went to a temple today and i did n't feel anything .

you wan na come ?

ok. maybe i 'll walk down with you .

evelyn waugh ?

oh , wait , can you hold on one sec ?

we 're here for the week . i 'm shooting in osaka for a few days .

... doing like twenty million interviews a day ... it 's soo good to see you . how long are you here for ?

you really had me going , claire . i was finally ready to propose to you .

she 's been stalking you , peter .

well , it shattered your faith in everything .

it 's with me all the time , claire , i just do n't like to talk about it .

no , of course not , but i think now that this has happened , a lot of things can start to come out ...

i do n't know . in a way , i 'm glad it all happened .

i 'm still shaking .

when did they find her ?

what happened ?

well , it 's a nice surprise . should i hit the `` stop '' button ?

i spaced out .

hey , what are you doing here in the middle of the day ?

it 's susan 's cooking , claire . that 's why uncle james lets them stay .

she 's a talk show host . they ca n't be charmed . by definition .

i missed you .

... you wearing a watch , father ?

nonsense , it 's all of our home . so how 's work treating you ?

peter , are you okay ?

quiet . real quiet ...

you 're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism .

my secretary ?

when your secretary called , she made no mention of her coming , too .

mr. kelson , what a pleasure to meet you . i have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable . i am a fan .

but your patient is legally entitled to it .

and was he in distress when you opened the door ? or was he sitting here , relaxed , at this table ?

i hope so .

i do n't mean to belittle you , but we 've been through this before . satan is not what you think he is . satan is not some creature .

i had to . there was no other way . their deaths were part of the greatest legacy i could have given you .

you killed my parents .

do n't you get it ? they had their 2,000 years . now it 's our turn .

peter . your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you .

but it 's true . i have no faith . it 's strange . when that gun was pointed at my face tonight , i was surprised , but never frightened . it was as if i knew nothing could possibly happen to me and ... in that one moment i did n't care about anything . not eve my own life .

you 're right , but it 's funny . all my life i thought i was simply a man who did n't believe in any of it .

what is it ?

father , please do n't die .

um hm . that 's right , maya .

do n't worry ... about the transformation , maya .

oh , thank you , thank you so much !

peter ... peter kelson .

what 's his name ?

thirteen . the last time , can you believe it ? this is how he says `` goodbye ? ''

what did he say to you in french ?

sure .

i do n't know . extra apartment keys . what 's it matter ?

what about after ?

i 'm scared i 'm slipping back .

i see things . my worst fears . you need to know something , peter . i was possessed once . like birdson . it took father lareaux six days to pull me out of it .

sometimes , when i feel weak , i have these ... visions .

comfort .

there 's nothing else here .

what ?

peter , let go of the chair !

i do n't know . i do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way . i do n't know if it works the same way in this instance . i do n't even know when it 's going to happen .

and if what you 're saying is true , what would happen to me ?

then why are you here ?

so what ?

there 's no reason why you should . this has been planned from your birth . you fit all the criteria that we know of . never baptized , born of incest , devoid of faith ...

you 're about to become the anti-christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world .

if you 're possessed , you ca n't reveal anything satan wants hidden . unless you trick him .

at the exorcism , birdson boasted that satan is about to take over the body of a man . you are that man , peter .

that 's their explanation . you might not believe me ...

i had to .

i cranked it all the way up . nothing but hum .

what do you mean ?

the world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil . unfortunately i find it much more slippery and elusive place .

i 'll bet .

well , then it all seems to be working out for you . listen , ms ... ?

in the end , the jury saw it my way .

ooooooh-kayyyyyy .

that there is no such thing as evil with a capital `` e . ''

listen , i 'm sorry , but i 'm running late .

thank you . do you work in the building ? you coming from the party ?

may i help you ?

i 'm not waiting until it 's too late .

we 'll see father frank in the morning . there 's nothing to be done until then .

i 've dealt with these people before , maya . they 're not going to help us .

hello ?

viznick will get off and michael 's got a crush on you .

you are the younger of two ...

i 'd appreciate it if you 'd put that back .

i 'll be at bedford tonight , if you need me .

the police used him as a witness in this case .

sometimes i can just feel the numbers .

lem me guess . the lottery .

and what about you ? what about peter kelson ? where is your moral compass ?

well , george viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum . viznick is not psychotic . he 's simply unable to submit to any higher authority .

well , long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject . after awhile , you begin to make friends with it , so to speak .

peter , you 're now writing a book about the viznick case . you seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers . i have to ask , how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day , face to face with alleged killers ?

had to let her go . i see you thinkin ' there , superstar . do n't .

where is she now ?

not what the records show . anyway , she was a runaway , arrests for vandalism , petty theft , drugs , the whole bit . parole records show she graduated from community college , moved into a retreat house , teaches some classes at the seminary school , has n't been in any trouble since .

she 's got a juvenile record from new orleans . parents died when she was 13 .

she came to me with a wild story about demonic possession .

sure thing . look , i 've got enough , between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts . you can go home . gim me til morning . find out who he is . until then , do n't sweat it , huh ? just your random bad cheese trying to hole you .

yeah , right . i do n't know why i bothered inviting you guys . i knew you would n't show .

mike . oh , the christening . i meant to call ...

what was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things i knew could help you ?

child , please . ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything i had to say .

i asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy .

engaged .

what ?

taste this .

i wo n't . i 'm a lesbian .

fine , you do n't like this one , which one would you rather wear ?

ah , mom .

monica , what did you do ?

the doctor said it was okay . anyway , i 'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat .

... and if you want a thicker base , you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour .

you know , girl , long as i 've lived next door , i 've never seen the inside of this house .

you think i 'd go hoarse for a player with no potential ? when i ignore you , that 's when you worry . go get dressed .

coach ...

i can take it .

huh ?

oh , sorry .

got ta wait til the press conference .

quincy , word has it you might make the jump the nba .

you 're just scared . i know rehab is hard , and you have to worry about whether you 'll be as good as you were but you will be . i believe in you . you just have to get back on the court . like you 'd get back on a horse .

i do n't know sometimes .

to do what you love .

baby , do n't talk like that . your rehab 's going well . you 'll be back before you know it .

get used to it , babe .

it means a lot that you came by .

too many times .

you ever been in love ?

if you were tore up i would not be claiming you . trust .

i told him you looked like me .

damn , lena ... who is he ?

mom tell you to do this ?

found ? i 'm not some charity case .

so what 's going on with the spring dance ? you have a date yet ?

just try and chill a little bit , alright .

always on my ass , anyway .

no .

so how 's the job going ?

what ?

i was just showing emotion .

sometimes . but what 's the alternative , not playing ? you remember big toni ? she quit last year , now she 's working at some bookstore . i mean , look at us . they treat us like we 're hollywood stars over here . we just played in the championship game . it does n't get much sweeter than this .

yup . so i 've been playing with this italian club the last three years .

i 'm gon na love winning this championship in your house .

never let a freshman take your spot .

just one word of advice for next season .

no buts . took a lot of heart to take that charge .

did n't have to try very hard .

you were trying to make me look bad .

that 's what you get for trying to show out , freshman .

coach hates me , does n't she ?

if i lose , i 'll buy you a wedding present .

so ?

you once said the reason i beat you was because you wanted me to .

what will this prove ?

what ?

because you do n't pull this on someone who 's about to get married .

then why are you so upset ?

i heard enough .

it 's not fun for me anymore because you 're missing .

you woke me up to tell me that ?

we need to talk .

what 's going on ?

so why 'd you give up ball ?

it 's a trip , you know ? when you 're a kid , you see the life you want , and it never crosses your mind that it 's not gon na turn out that way .

that a nice way of saying i rode the bench ?

who 's this guy i always see her around ?

no .

a rest ?

i thought a torn acl was ten to twelve .

a lot of things . all i know is i 'll be back in six months .

what are the doctors saying ?

yup .

should n't you be lying down , or ...

i 'm not asking for us to be together .

well , if all you care about is basketball , why you fucking me ? go fuck dick vitale .

if i stayed , i would n't be starting !

stay !

what , `` q-man '' , did i forget to kiss your ass like everybody else ?

i just said i did n't fuck around . but you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me .

what the hell 's going on ?

you want to go talk ?

sorry about your game .

what 's up ?

for real . i should be alone , anyway .

quincy ...

nothing . why do n't we walk to my dorm ?

i know a lot of brothers dog their wives , i just never thought my pops would do some shit like this ...

you 're not stupid .

do n't put your hands in your pockets , hold your head up , always look a man in the eye , and all the time i 'm hanging on his every word like he 's god or something ...

i wanted you to .

what ?

so how about a little one-on-one ?

that was so weak .

i do n't have it easy like you , alright . there 's no red carpet laid out for me .

then prove her wrong .

quit .

fine , quincy .

i ca n't be nice to a fan ?

you do see me standing here , right ?

what ?

so what dead-end street did you and shawnee hit ?

he ai n't spalding .

hey .

i do n't .

did n't know you cared so much .

please , you jump in some guy 's face , talk smack and you get a pat on your ass . but because i 'm a female , i get told to calm down and act like a `` lady '' . i 'm a ballplayer , okay . a ball player .

i 'm warning you , do n't tempt me .

see , that 's why you ai n't getting recruited .

i do n't .

so she 's honest .

and ?

why she got ta be a ho , just cause she wants to get with me .

guess `` please '' would be a stretch .

i want to ride my own bike .

for how long ?

i do n't like flowers .

what do i have to do ?

uh huh .

for real ?

it 's this big hole . you could almost see bone .

told you i was nice . i 'm going to be the first girl in the nba .

i do n't wan na look fast . thanks , girl .

hey , girl .

almost did n't recognize you with your hair like that . how you been ?

keep your voice down .

i 'm just saying it 'd be nice if you found time for your family . you should see the tramps coming after quincy . if you do n't talk to him ...

mom , we ca n't let something like this mess up the family .

whose truth are you talking about ?

what are you doing in my room ?

uh , your earring ?

what is this ?

yeah .

after five years .

i 'm saying i handled my responsibilities like a man . but when you 're in the nba , you pull into a city and there 's a hundred women waiting at the hotel . and another twenty that made it past security on your floor . and the boldest one is standing right at your door . and after awhile , it just becomes part of the game . i 'm sorry i lied to you , i should n't have . but i did it cause i love you .

i ai n't a damn liar .

a case like this could hang around for months and i 'm up for this player relations job with the `` clips . '' this gets out , false or not , no one 'll touch me .

well , tell them to mind their damn business . you 're smart enough to get a degree .

let 's hope i can say the same about you one day .

'' so me ? i 'm runnin ' on full throttle the whole fuckin ' time . dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties . but i'ii tell you this : the battle of the bush is being fought and won by team mackey . can i have a cigarette ?

if you 're up to it , i 've got us set up in a suite upstairs --

kind of .

oh , yeah . no , no , no . they would n't --

ok. that 's why . i had trouble locating your school records at berkely and ucla . your name change -- they had no official enrollment --

in five years ?

people die .

what does she say about , `` seduce and destroy . ''

does you mother still work ?

where are you from originally ?

... just wait ... dad ... you want something ... can you say ...

mischief ? what the fuck you talkin ' about , mischief ?

yes i can , marcie . and until you start givin ' me some straight answers : i 'm gon na assume that some mischief has been goin ' on here .

ok. marcie . starting now i want you to have a new attitude with me . the more you play games , the more suspicious i 'm gon na become that you 've been up to something .

i went out last night .

i do n't know a loud crash .

yeah . yes .

you 're jimmy gator , right ?

hello . is claudia here ?

we 're not going out two days before we set the record , it 's not gon na happen .

was it a call back ?

movie of the week . i went up for one this morning with alan thicke and corey haim --

shut the fuck up .

-- unless frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that 's what will happen .

well . considering that there 's no one else mentioned in the will ... we 'd have to go to the laws of intestacy , which is -- as if someone died without a will --

like a shrink , like if i go to see a shrink , i 'm protected , i can say things -- fuck -- i do n't know what i 'm doing --

... .it 's alright ... .

earl asked me , linda , please , linda , i 'm sorry -- earl asked me --

put the fuckin ' phone down , hang it up .

hang up the phone .

i 've got frank ... frank earl 's son . he 's ... he asked me to get him and i did --

what are you doing ?

linda --

i come in here - you do n't know , you do n't know who the fuck i am or what my life is and you have the fucking balls , the < u > indecency < /u > to ask me a question about my life --

... i do n't ... .

hello .

do you have that ?

yeah .

yeah .

um , no , y'know what ? forget the water , just give me a loaf of bread ... white bread .

bottled water ?

water .

i 'd like to get an order of ... um ... peanut butter .

phone number .

did you piss your fuckin ' pants , stanley ?

maybe .

alright .

... oh jesus , what the fuck ... ?

i do n't know .

bullshit . bullshit . you know the answer to every goddamn question and i knew the answer to those questions and i 'm not half as smart as you are so what happened ?

what 's the problem , what 's the problem here ?

go to it , handsome .

-- i did n't see you from the window .

i got an audition , i wo n't make it here 'till two , c'mon , i 'll see you later . love you .

... fuck you mean , it 's raining frogs ?

... what ... ?

... .why does he do it ... ?

it 's ok .

there were two . not one . but two .

then we will both die traitors , d'artagnan .

nothing ... nothing .

he is nothing now .

my guards are useless ! take her from me !

louis , please -- !

i wish to discuss your brother .

mother -- ?

you bring me the heart of the jesuit general , and you will have a palace of your own .

i grow closer to my target , your majesty .

your majesty ...

if i find out the identity of this jesuit rebel . i will kill both him and the man who told me .

to the bastille . and death .

aramis , this will never --

i offer you the perfect revolution . a revolution without bloodshed , without any loss of life , even without treason , for he too is the son of the king .

he can learn to be phillippe in time . but first he must learn to be louis , and for that he has two more days .

but aramis -- ! phillippe can learn in time , but --

but -- what is he doing ?

going into the barn naked -- or so it appears .

but -- what is porthos doing ?

you can do it .

how is he ?

he who is not with us is against us .

tomorrow .

well here is the problem at hand : the king has ordered me to discover the identity of the governor general of jesuits , and kill him . as our english rivals have left the catholic church , louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of europe by uniting church and state and making himself head of both . he has already picked the pope . only the jesuits , who put god above throne or papacy , stand in his way .

a simple theological discussion .

who ?

then let him kill me , if all my faith is wrong .

we go someplace dangerous .

what use am i ?

you 've been moping for months . now that you 've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way , you can stop boring me and start being useful to me . now get some rest .

not just a baby , porthos . i carried the child of the king .

the greatest secret of life is who we truly are . now i must give you that secret , which has been kept from you your whole life . it began on the night when louis was born .

where are we ?

please revel with me , aramis , i need my spirits lifted . i 'm old , i 'm weak , my strength is gone --

it worked !

raoul --

fromberge ... ? ! at the front ? ! no .

never mind , papa , it does n't matter now . she loved me once . i want to die remembering that .

he lies . he is here to trap us .

an oath is an oath precisely because it can not be removed !

athos , i beg you --

save my son , d'artagnan .

raoul is hurrying to the front , so i must hurry too .

you trust his character more than anyone else does .

she 's a woman , d'artagnan ! from a poor family . you may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything , but i am old and hard and i 've seen too much . even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire , because power seduces even more than love !

if the young woman truly loves raoul --

i was feeling sorry for myself . raoul is getting married , he proposed today ! i love that boy beyond all measure , i 've spent everything i own to give him education and opportunity . now he has complete happiness , and i mope .

they must stay sharp . there was an attempt on the king 's life today .

midnight ! mon dieu ! driving the youngsters hard , eh ?

you ca n't drink with a friend you have n't seen in months ?

all this time ... i was a lost secret . but you were hiding all your loyalty , all your love . you were the man in the iron mask .

if i could have a blade , then i would be please to run with you .

one for all . all for one .

your mother 's .

whose rooms are those ?

what is that ?

recent hours have been a shock .

phillippe . rest now .

and you never knew why ?

a man in black . i never saw his face . he took me to the cell . a blacksmith came and they put me into the mask . for days i shouted , `` what have i done ? why do you do this to me ? '' but no one heard , so i just stopped shouting .

even the bedchamber passages ! let none remain !

you will protect me as you always have , d'artagnan .

i just left the garden , it was empty . what did you see ?

there is more to love than he knew , or that you know .

it is not raoul 's heart alone that concerns me . it is yours . i know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like michelle . but do they love you ? do you love them ? what about a queen to love ? a son of your own ?

in his mind , anyway , and soon enough in hers . she had written him many letters of love .

i already know about the riots , d'artagnan , i heard them out there whispering . some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food . i will deal with it tomorrow .

aaa ! d'artagnan ! these passages were constructed for the king 's security , not so you could step from my father 's portrait and startle me to death !

wait . bargain me to louis , for all your lives . you have done your best . let me go , and let all of you find peace .

you 've ... memorized ... ?

what number did you tear out ?

magnificent valor ...

when he returns , watch him . when he leaves again , you tell me .

do you want athos arrested , your majesty ?

you may go , lieutenant .

... he did -- but captain d'artagnan blocked his way .

aramis ! i have been expecting you ! we are satisfied , that will do .

raoul ... oh , raoul ...

i will order a mass for his soul . it will guarantee his place in heaven .

i did not want to upset you . it was tragic . i did everything i could for him . i ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety , far from the fighting . but he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger .

wait , no ! do not be ashamed . the straits of your family need not be permanent . it is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates , where they may have fine meals , and physicians to look after them .

it 's lovely . it 's just ...

the food does n't please you ?

raoul ... is in love ...

from raoul . he urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger ... from your king .

sire ! i -- how did you --

yeah , stick around , you might learn something .

if you guys want in , fine . just remember this is our jurisdiction .

i 'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth .

if what you 're saying is true , then why would he have killed two police officers ? a man like that would want to lay low , if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission !

our agency monitors all threats very carefully , and there 's good reason to believe jim trudell has the training , the connections , and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large .

alright , stay on the phone .

you set to go -

where are you ?

yeah ?

so what is they have enough to shut us down !

well why do n't you sit this one and get some rest ... you look like shit . cut to int tubbs ' apartment - night

outside hacker ? what the fuck are you talking about ?

hey what they did on their time was their business , you know ? i just want to catch this scumbag , wherever he is .

when did you join the force ? you know , the police force , the place you work ...

what ?

if you can trail him to a remote area do it . we all want a piece of him but let 's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here .

right behind you .

i do n't know how you 're used to doing things , marvosa , but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me !

it happened too fast . he was in the back , quiet and calm and boom ! he was out - and gone . we ... we fanned out ... stanton must have let his guard down !

did you report it stolen ?

yeah , it was opened - with a goddamn screwdriver ! ! !

i did n't break in - the back door was open !

who am i ? i 'm gon na be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me . you understand ? where did you get the car !

nothing ! he did n't do nothing !

hell , he probably raped her in the lot , dumped the body somewhere . that 's what he was like - a real wacko .

the guy was looking for trouble , shoving people around , being an asshole ...

vice ... you think they had something to do with this dead hooker ?

well it 's just kind of a coincidence , is n't it ? stanton and fleming , both started in '83 , both in area six ... both in vice ?

something i do n't already know ?

did you read today 's paper ?

what ? wait a minute -

yeah ?

they found the getaway mercedes a parking garage north of venice . it checks out .

who is it ?

yeah ... they did . one girl ...

did n't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room ?

what exactly did you see ?

well you figured wrong ! and now i 'm public enemy number one . you have an answer for that ?

only on dates ?

you always carry a gun with you ?

do n't worry about me ... ... and do n't forget your helmet . you do n't want to get a ticket .

i 'm going to need a way to get there .

you know this time , there 's nobody that 's gon na cover your ass . you 're over your head this time .

i gave all that up . i got tired of the lies . they wanted to stuff me in levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment . it got so i did n't know who to trust anymore ... ... some things never change , i guess .

so ... what happened to you , jimmy ? i figure you 'd be in some far off place somewhere , living on the edge like the good old days .

i 'll access the lapd mainframe , but we got ta be careful - that one 's kind of tricky -

how about marvosa and the others ?

ok ... county tax records ... they 're saying 1490 breckinridge is owned by ... an atlantic trust corporation ... they have a p.o . box in d.c .

no thanks . how do you know they ca n't catch you on this thing ?

let 's see what we got ...

1490 ... breckinridge ...

i have nowhere else to go , tubbs , i need your help !

you got ta turn yourself in . before it 's too late -

jimmy , do you realize what you did ? man that 's like death penalty shit -

oh , shit , shit , shit - i do n't know about all this ! you sure ? !

hello tubbs . can i come in ?

it 's ... it 's a long story . can we meet somewhere ?

jim trudell ! bravo company !

i 'm stranded out here .

well i 've kind of had my fill of the place , you know what i mean ?

county jail - get in .

then what did you do , play canasta ?

what ?

did you have sex with her ?

if he pushes too deep into our boy 's mind-set , he may destroy himself . what are you planning , jack ?

i would n't presume to try .

remember when you asked for a study on him , i refused . same goes for now .

kevin and molly are on their way to montana . who the hell is he to do this to my family , sidney ? answer me that ... !

how are molly and the boy ?

sidney : i do n't understand him . we know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience . to witness the act . we know he thinks the act is making him into something different . his 'becoming ' ... but i do n't know what it is he thinks he 's becoming . the answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors . that 's what 's missing for me . why the mirrors ?

what have we missed ?

christ !

not the bible ?

if there 's any doubt , we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the smithsonian teeth . this is your boy ... he folded the bottom part , including what lecktor tore out . in this enlargement of the back side , oblique light revealed impressions . we can make out : 'six-six-six ' . i did n't spot it until i had this high-contrast print . i advised chicago as soon as i saw it .

that could be the tip of a 't . here and here . and here .

this is chester here . who am i talking to ?

let 's go to bed . i 'll rub your back .

talking about 'like , ' you do n't like me very much , do you ?

there 's somebody in the house , jack ...

you 're not going to need that . because we 're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a st. louis pd swat team is going to take him . not us .

parking permits ...

no . it 's bob 's photo store in ...

we want the cans the jacobi home movies came in . they 're in the far corner of the room under the windows .

that 's why the boltcutter .

will ?

there is none ! we 've run it through the computer a dozen times .

vtr , film , polaroid , stills , what ?

'changes ? '

when are you coming back ?

that 's narrow ?

what 's it narrow down to ?

asian studies at langley said the mark you found on the tree is a chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling . the character also appears on a mah- jongg piece . it means red dragon . that mean anything to you ?

who is it ?

after we 've worked the note we want to replace it in lecktor 's cell . i do n't want him to know we found it . where 's lector now ?

how 'd you know 'broken mirrors ? ' bribe a cop ? tell it to the u.s. attorney , lounds !

did price get anywhere with the single prints off the leeds ?

see ? you do know something about him .

why ?

we 're running it through the computers now . so far there 's no event or service that doubles back into both families . plus they were big consumers : snowmobiles , fishing trips , scuba , videogames , lots of routine medical and dental . it 's a haystack . what 's the other ?

we find an event that connects both families . same vacation hotel ; same hospital , different times . then we check employees and come up with a male nurse , hairdresser , whatever ... if we find out how he found them , then we 'll find him .

no .

typed him from semen . he 's a secretor .

where the hell 's graham !

some remarkable events have happened in birmingham and atlanta . do you know what i 'm talking about ?

yes .

you 'll come by ?

are you okay ... ?

yes , are you okay ... ? !

that was nice of you to think of that .

ready to tell me what kind of 'outing ' this is ?

uh-huh .

i 'll probably go back to it someday .

shooting at maybe eight feet . i ca n't use any lights .

no !

they will find out about you . they will lock you in a place worse than brother buddy 's .

absolutely ,

you will tell the truth ?

yes .

do you see ?

look at the screen . that is william blake 's 'the great red dragon and the woman clothed with the sun . ' do you see ?

i do n't want to know .

what am i doing here ?

do you have it ?

yes ?

dr. chilton .

come in .

well , it 's about goddamn time ! i have a note here , or two pieces of a note , that appears to be from the man who killed those people in atlanta and ... .

uh ... sure ...

i want to see lecktor now .

no .

as long as it 's on soft paper . you may ... find this curious .

thank you very much .

3680 desoto highway . marathon , florida .

she does n't have a rolodex .

goodbye .

he 's very strong physically .

let 's get straight who we 've talking about . are you the man i 'm interested in ?

i get a lot of calls . most of them are from people who say they know things .

psychologists call him a sociopath . they do n't know what else to call him .

what happened to them ?

sex murder : three . he likes to bite . six bad ones in mrs. leeds . eight in mrs. jacobi ... ... that 's all i have .

that 's all we know about . most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center . a suck mark . these do n't . so , for him , biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior . you could try emergency room personnel , treatment for bite wounds . i know that 's pretty thin ... he bites a lot .

he only bit women so far , right ?

'intimate ? ! ''

mrs. leeds was a good-looking woman . i 'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation , would n't you ?

will , they never get to see kevin and a few more days ...

i want to see you , too .

i was out in the garden . mama came out and told me when she saw it on tv . why did n't you call me ?

no . i have to be in there ... alone . maybe there 's something for me if i know how he feels and thinks .

and ... where are things ?

no .

can you quit ?

can i have one of your cigarettes ?

hey , goddamn it , paint it shit-brown for all i care ... look , i 'm sorry . when i come home , we 'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and ...

yellow 's a bad color for me . i 'll look green at breakfast .

i 'm thinking about painting the kitchen . what color do you like , will ? are you there ?

hey , baby ! where are you ?

you mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma . you are open and easy now ... it took you a lot of work to get to that ...

and you said ?

he asked how you are .

he stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here .

i know ... 'out in the good air ... '

my grandboy 's been eatin ' a ton of breakfast every day . been out riding . must be the good air . you oughta see that little booger eat . i 'll bet he 's gained ten pounds . molly 's out in the motor home ...

sure he is . blond . probably scandinavian , too ...

that 's right .

i 'll come inside with you , if you like , but mr. crawford said you 'd probably want to be alone .

no .

yes . hobbs had one of his daughters from behind . he was cutting her . i shot him .

how ?

i 'll hang around in here . i 'll just be in the kitchen , mom ...

in this hatchery ? forty to fifty .

how many turtle eggs you think are in here ?

will it keep them out ?

i want to help you , will . you 'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself . we do n't invent our natures , they 're issued to us . along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else . why fight it ?

goodbye , dr. lecktor . you can leave messages for me at the number on the file .

do you know how you caught me , will ?

may i keep the file ?

when you do have one i 'd like to hear it .

yes . i 'd considered it .

that 's interesting .

big backyards , fences , some hedges , why ?

yes .

i do n't think i 'll persuade you . you 'll do it or you wo n't . dr. bloom is working an it anyway , and he 's the best ...

do n't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity .

you 're very tan , will .

i thought you might be curious to find our if you 're smarter than the person i 'm looking for .

pray tell .

you 'll get to see the file on this case . and there 's another reason .

why should i tell you ?

very interesting , even to a layman .

dr. bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of clinical psychiatry .

no .

i -- i got some freaky rare kind . it 's called large-celled carcinoma .

no , it 's true . i have lung cancer .

what , you do n't think i can beat him ?

andy , do you realize you do n't do comedy anymore ? where 's that sweet guy who used to do `` here i come to save the day ! '' ? please , enough with the wrestling ! you 've lost touch with reality !

wrong ! you have n't given them any clues that it 's a parody !

no , i 'm not gon na take it . if i take it i 'll break my back .

but i feel you 're extending this philosophy to real life . it 's obsessive . nothing 's ever on the level anymore .

`` funny '' ? i dunno . but `` intriguing '' ... `` mindboggling '' ... perhaps `` headache-inducing '' ... sure . like , that moment , when you both came onstage ...

but was n't it funny ?

oh dear ! george , this is gon na kill tony . he 's waited his whole life for this break .

oh no ! did he get hurt ?

how long would they let me sleep ?

when you play the midwest and south , you do n't mindfuck these people ! it 's not postmodern -- it 's rude . if you wan na perform in texas , you give 'em mighty mouse ! you give 'em elvis ! !

tell you what . i 'll book you on some concerts , and meanwhile , we 'll show the special around ... see if somebody wants to buy it --

that 's alright . where ... ?

those are my terms .

of course ! that 's what negotiations are for .

okay . fine , i 'll do it . but i have a few terms .

i 'm not interested . i want to create my own material .

b-but , this is classy ... they did bob newha --

i told you , i 'm not a comedian . and sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment : stupid jokes and canned laughter .

andy ... this is every comedian 's dream .

`` no '' ? `` no '' to which part ? ?

george , i hate sitcoms .

and this is a class act ! it 's the guys who did the mary tyler moore and bob newhart shows ! it takes place in a taxi stand ! and you 're gon na be the fonzie !

you show a lot of promise ... but ... my concern is i do n't know where to book you . you 're not a stand-up ... your act does n't exactly translate to films ... help me ... where do you see yourself ?

people love ... comedians .

tank you veddy much .

hey , i really enjoyed your set .

well , everyone else gets this place cookin ' ! pal , it 's hard for me to move the booze when you 're singin ' `` pop goes the weasel . ''

what do you want ? `` take my wife , please '' ? ?

eh , i dunno ... andy . i 'm ... thinkin ' of letting you go ...

andy !

maybe i should talk to the natives . shoom boom boo ba ! shoom boom boo ba --

these kinds of things go on everyday at the networks , only you never see it , because they cut to commercials . now for sure they 're gon na fire me , so if you want to see me again , you 'll have to come to memphis ...

ten .

excuse me -- ?

how can you be so casual ? ? !

oh , it 's open .

i can shtop whenever i want ...

is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble ? ?

no ! you get in the kitchen . i 'm gon na make you dry my dishes !

gosh . gee , lynne ... i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves .

why did you call me ? the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you .

get off !

andy , it 'll be fine ! it 's what we 're known for ! `` maui ? `` wowie ! ''

t-there was n't a reason to purposely hurt me --

then your father 's a wimp .

who gives a shit ? ! it 's not funny !

yeah , my problem is you 're tired .

`` ... has been rushed to a nearby hospital , where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis . his parents are at his bedside . fans will best remember kaufman as lovable latka on television 's taxi '' ...

no offense , pal , but i just do n't think you 're built for it . these he- men 'll kick your ass ! ! they 're huge !

look at this ! an evil russian ! ooo , here 's an evil nazi -- he likes to fight dirty ! hey , here 's an evil japanese guy !

boy , they totally fell for it ! i 'm only acting crazy !

no ! andy , do n't do it --

what ? ! ?

hey andy , good show .

the wrestling ... the sexist remarks ... the foul language ... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual . it seems you have no respect for anything .

yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to tm . but we feel that perhaps ... you and the program have grown apart philosophically .

we are all impressed .

um , yes . i have n't fought with them , since i started here .

gene , you misunderstood ! ! you 're not getting both of them ! it 's physically impossible !

oh .

get off my stage ! you 're fired !

yeah ! ! i talked to andy kaufman !

`` burlesque '' ?

kaufman 's a lying bastard ! if you sign him , i 'll ruin you !

er , yes . speaking .

if i find out you 're behind this , i 'll kill you .

but what 's the point ? how will any of this make you the biggest star in the world ?

bob , andy needs to relax . see if you can get him away from all this . take him to hawaii , or bali ... find something special . something nice ...

i 'm worried about andy . his stress level is affecting his work .

why is he saying these things ? !

where ?

they wo n't make it .

hurry !

i sent two units . they 're bringing her down now .

should tank i.d . it ?

what ?

weird .

you got the money ?

it 's choi .

goddamn you , cypher !

that 's what you think . they 've promised to back me , trinity . they 're going to reinsert my body . i 'll go back to sleep and when i wake up , i 'll be fat and rich and i wo n't remember a goddamn thing . it 's the american dream .

hello , trinity .

i just keep wondering if morpheus is so sure , why does n't he take him to the oracle ? she would know .

do n't tell me you 're a believer now ?

i ... it does n't matter what i believe .

how ?

... yeah .

midnight watch .

nearest exit is franklin and erie . an old appliance store .

just get me outta here .

i need an exit ! fast !

he 's beginning to believe .

we have no choice .

we found him , trinity . we finally found him .

shit ! apoc ?

you have to focus . there is a phone . wells and lake . you can make it .

she told you exactly what you needed to hear . that 's all . sooner or later , neo , you 're going to realize just like i did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path .

morpheus , i do n't know --

no . i did not . i have never told anyone this , neo . after i saw the oracle i thought ... no , i misunderstood what she told me . i believed that it was all about me . that i would find the one , not that he would find me .

yes i do .

why ? so i can hear some old lady tell me , what ? that i 'm this guy that everybody 's been waiting for ? the one that 's supposed to save the world ? come on . how do i respond to that ? i ca n't . it 's ridiculous . i mean who am i ? i 'm nobody , i 'm just a guy . what did i do , morpheus ? why me ?

what do i believe it ? are you kidding me ? what do you think ? i 'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything i believed was real , was n't . the whole world , my entire life was a lie . i do n't know anything anymore , morpheus .

i told you i do n't believe in this stuff . no matter what she says i 'm not going to believe it , so what 's the point ?

why ?

that i would find the one .

and she knows what ? everything ?

the beginning ?

set down in there .

yeah .

no you do n't . did you see the woman in the red dress ?

i thought it was n't real .

do you know why you did n't make it ?

show me .

why do my eyes hurt ?

what are you doing ?

the pill you took is part of a trace program . it 's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location .

do you want to know what it is ?

let me tell you why you are here . you have come because you know something . what you know you ca n't explain but you feel it . you 've felt it your whole life , felt that something is wrong with the world . you do n't know what , but it 's there like a splinter in your mind , driving you mad . it is this feeling that brought you to me . do you know what i 'm talking about ?

because i do n't like the idea that i 'm not in control of my life .

do you still want to meet ?

you 're the one , neo . you see , you may have spent the last few years looking for me , but i 've spent most of my life looking for you .

the agents --

no ! it 's too far away .

the cubicle across from you is empty .

morpheus ...

do it !

i 'm going to make the call .

tank , charge the e.m.p .

we 're on our way --

how is he ?

what ?

what 's funny ?

sorry , kid . you got the gift but looks like you 're waiting for something .

how did you know ... ?

i 'd ask you to sit down , but you 're not going to anyway . and do n't worry about the vase .

yeah .

not yet .

what ?

i 'm not the one , trinity . the oracle hit me with that too .

i have to .

what are you doing ?

there has to be something that we can do .

goddamnit ! goddamnit !

i do n't know . it just went dead .

is morpheus alive ?

we have to !

we ca n't leave him !

it might have been . i 'm not sure .

how much like it ? was it the same cat ?

what did you just say ?

is it ?

that the matrix can not tell you who you are .

it disables any electrical system in the blast radius . it 's the only weapon we have against the machines .

we think you 're bugged . try to relax .

from you .

it 's necessary , neo . for our protection .

please . just listen . i know why you 're here , neo . i know why you left your family and your friends , why you left your home to come to this city . you 're looking for him .

right now , all i can tell you , is that you are in danger . i brought you here to warn you .

do you want to go somewhere and talk ?

my name is trinity .

mr. wizard , get me the fuck out of here !

neo , this has to be done !

depends on the mind . but eventually , it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this .

see who ?

any holes ? nope . me and my brother dozer , we are 100 percent pure , old- fashioned , home-grown human . born free . right here in the real world . genuine child of zion .

trinity , we do n't have any other choice .

he 's alive .

yes . they 're moving him . i do n't know where yet .

no , really , i liked it ... thought it was great .

know where he is ?

and cherry bombs ... ash cans ... and rockets ?

yeah .

well , my stuff comes from maryland ... you know what that means ?

nobody sees where i get the stuff . that 's good business . i 'll be back in thirty minutes .

yeah .

hey ... no more good times like before . until you come back .

i 'll say that i 'm travelling .

yeah .

it 's an open ticket . i can go anywhere up to $ 350 .

i know , i know , stupid . i mean where you goin ' ?

where to ?

look at her .

you got some mouth !

it 'll be ok - i know those guys . they wo n't stiff you .

next time , bet with your own kind .

good idea .

charlie , twenty-eight bucks is nothing . the only way to do it is through your uncle ... think about it will you ?

no you 're not ...

me ? i would n't say a word to my aunt and uncle ... or even your uncle , charlie ...

johnny , i swear to god , if you open your mouth about any of this ...

well kids ... have the bans been announced yet ?

yeah , teresa , shut up ! we do n't wan na get charlie here in trouble , do we ? ... we love charlie .

you tell me that in front of these creeps ?

i do n't get involved with anything , you understand that ? nothing ! i 'm clean as far as you know ... right ?

i swear to god charlie ... my arm still hurts from the car accident ... that 's why i did n't go to work . i swear it .

did you see them run !

let 's get out of here .

ok , ok ... take it easy . i 'll show . tuesday i 'll give michael something . i promise .

i 'll tell you what i do n't do ... i do n't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest , stupid . show up or i break both your arms , we understand each other ?

there wo n't be any this week .

yeah , big man ... get yourself in more trouble . you make a fool out of him , you 're doing the same to me . i signed for you do n't forget .

i do n't think i should go home looking like this . you think i could stay at your place tonight ? your mother 's not there is she ?

it 's the truth , i swear .

he 'd rather have the loan payed , you know that .

what pipes ... the ones from last year ... those pipes .

you 're really crazy .

be seeing you and johnny tonight ... here ... right ?

he could at least show some respect and show his face , even if he does n't have the money ...

$ 3,000 . shit ! can we hold it at $ 3,000 ?

how much was the original loan again ?

you kiddin . the way it is now this is n't even interest for two hours .

$ 20 .

how much ?

we 'll settle it tonight .

all right ... but understand , i do n't like being taken advantage of . i mean you 're in there talking with your uncle and all ... this is embarassing .

look ... i 've talked to him and i 've talked to him ... what more can i do ... ? tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head ... ok ?

ok ... that 's it .

ok , get in .

i 'd like to know charlie , it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me ...

ok , ok ...

i was thinking maybe you 'd do very nicely for the place .

fine .

oh yes , he 's pretty good .

hey , where you been ?

ok .

about that shooting last night ... i was there and ...

fine . did you have a good time last night ?

`` francis macomber . ''

no , c'mon ... y'know , i read .

... he must have heard the name from those t.v . 's in the hall that were blaring all the time . i remember guevara was in town at the time . must 've heard it from there i guess ... but that 's funny , is n't it ?

well you ca n't blame them in a way .

you know why ... with my parents .

sure ... he lives there ?

i know you do n't . you 've been very preoccupied lately .

c'mon charlie ... one more day . i 'll call in sick for work .

it 's still sick .

do n't ask .

sure ... it 's not that ... i mean ...

ok , we 'll go for lunch .

count it .

i feel fine -- nothing wrong with me .

girls ? you call those skanks girls ? !

shut up .

you mean it 's heisted .

well ... no .

ah ... there 's a funny lookin ' cab behind us .

yeah , i think so .

this is some boat . your father 's ?

of course ! a double for michael , tony .

ok guys ... have a heart . this is my business .

and is n't it a lovely one ? so sturdy , so straight --

... i 'm here , are n't i ? would n't miss a loose end meeting . what 's on the table for discussion ? party favors , flowers -- hi dad , hi drew --

drew called from the astar , they 're still two minutes away .

did he ? that 's more than we get to do .

very .

love that name .

just plain 'joe ' ?

daddy ! come on , a name .

you know , darling , this is going to be a wonderful party .

do they , m'dear ?

hi , daddy , what do you think ?

conflict , honey . korean conflict .

-- black .

allison , i trust you . this is your thing .

yeah , but --

please do n't be negative , drew , we have an acceptance list that would do the white house proud -- the secretary-general of the un , the chairman of the fcc , nine senators , i do n't know how many congressmen , and at least twelve of the fortune '500 ' .

he said he would be there with bells on .

what about the mayor ?

red or white ?

9:30 's almost 10:30. where i come from , the sun 's over the yardarm , m'boy , and the cocktail lamp is lit .

well sir , it 's 9:30 in the morning .

good , good . glad to hear it .

oh , you 're the great joe 's attorney now ? are we going to go to court ? or are we going to go to bed ? and i do n't mean you and me . i mean you and him .

no , not okay . i thought we had a good thing going here . it shows you never know .

drew , you 're out of line .

the dagger -- ?

but i know she 's grateful for the care you 're giving her .

who are we talking about ?

yes .

`` death and taxes '' ?

and a glass .

the board of parrish communications - is hereby called to order . our sole order of business is an acceptance of john bontecou 's generous offer and --

i did n't say .

you 're talking through your hat . you 're offering a deal because you 've got no proof .

are you running this board or am i ?

certainly , bill .

the answer is no , quick enough for you ?

bontecou wants a quick response and --

whose ?

if i read this board right now , they want you to accept bontecou 's offer .

yes , you made your feeling abun- dantly clear . now they want to do the same with theirs .

well now it 's undone , okay ? forget bontecou ! scrub him ! i 'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer . i 'm not going for it .

i was hired , you told me , to help bring parrish communications into the 21st century . this merger is the vehicle --

why ?

before i do -- i was hoping we might be alone , bill .

you 're not familiar with the phrase , `` in this world , nothing is certain but death and taxes '' ?

uh -- he 's from out of town --

have we met ?

is there any more to it ?

yeah , something he goes by --

that 's great ! wait 'til i show it to bontecou .

... tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity , you and big john , it 'll lead network news . okay so far ?

in my sleep .

a voice ?

good morning , drew . thanks for coming out .

that 's what he said .

'it 's up to joe ' ?

the timing -- yes . he says it 's up to joe .

i 'd like to come , too . see susan strut her stuff .

are you ?

you 're overthinking it --

quince , m'man , thanks for the offer , but it 's all set for just me and bill . more people might --

brung you flowers and all i gettin 's facety back .

schoolboy tings is you head . badness for you , badness for her , badness for me , lyin ' here tumor , big as breadfruit , poison my inners an ' waiting .

nuthin ' .

doctor ? what could be wrong wit ' you ?

make it time .

i nuttin ' to do wi ' dat .

no , no . i on holiday .

obeah .

did n't you call a board meeting ?

the board is waiting .

-- and call my family , i 'd like them to come over for dinner tonight .

i 've been buzzing you , mr. parrish . are you all right ?

hi , jennifer .

free to love each other . com- pletely . totally . no fear .

what do you mean 'free ' ?

i was a world-class loser and she was a happy , little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in .

you love allison , do n't you ?

confused , huh ? about what ?

c'mon , have a drink . you look like you need one bad as me .

and you 're a nice man , quince .

no problem . i 'll leave you two alone . i can tell you guys have something on the fire --

that 's very gracious of you , quince .

hey , this is fun .

that 's it ?

susan --

i love you now , i 'll love you always --

but you 're not . you 're somewhere else . you 're someone else --

i 'm still here .

you want me to wait for you , you 'll be back --

and i said you 'd have a hard time finding a woman like that .

no worse than it gets for me . i 'm in love with a woman whom i do n't want to leave .

it gets worse .

well -- i --

yes . your father and i , our time together has come to an end .

oh , i hope a long , long time .

more than you love peanut butter ?

yes , he 's tired . i believe so .

he 's taking a nap .

i am .

why , yes . thank you .

it was everything .

-- i guess you have n't .

yes . i 'm tired .

'to bed ' ?

because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married .

why ?

how long have you been standing there ?

has her pain abated ?

i do n't know .

i mean i appreciate that .

well , now i am sorry . for intruding on you this afternoon .

yes .

watch me do what ?

how nice you look . is that your uniform ?

i think you want to go to the west wing . through there .

did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder ?

yes ?

when you put your mouth to his , susan , it seems a frequent thing .

do you love drew ?

peanut butter .

-- ca n't seem to escape you today .

it 's not necessary , joe . drew 's going to step aside --

joe , do n't do this --

i do n't like what you 're saying .

does she know where she 's going ?

i 'm sorry , bill --

say again ?

thanks .

uh --

may i remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor , this is me . so watch it ... bill .

yes , and stop repeating everything i say , and turning it into a question . spooning , fooling around , god knows what . you arrive on the scene -- why you picked me , i still do n't under- stand --

'spooning ' ?

well , you goddam well should . you walk into my life , give me the worst news a guy can get , have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family , and now you 're spooning with my daughter .

well , you 're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman .

i could n't sleep .

what 'okay ' is , it 's 'okay ' it 's over . we 've got bigger fish to fry , do n't we , joe ?

just a manner of speaking .

are you going to fire me , bill ?

how about you telling me ? when i ask a simple question , i expect a straight answer . that 's what i 'm used to . anybody who does n't give it to me , i fire .

and i do n't need your goddamn permis- sion either ! you ! drew ! i do n't need anyone to tell me how to run my life .

i thought you 'd heard a trillion times --

uh-huh .

oh . okay .

now i 'd like to be alone .

can you keep a secret ?

what 's it like ?

i understand .

i want to live .

that 's what everybody says .

so you 've grasped the idea . con- gratulations . now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever , and you still will have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about .

of course .

so you understand the concept then . when you 're busy here , your work , what your task is , is being executed elsewhere .

sounds fair enough .

oh , i would n't tell them anything , bill . you 'll ruin the good start we had last night . i felt as if i were being treated like a person . 'joe ' this and 'joe ' that - a nice smile - quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture ' or 'passion ' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting , but i am cer- tain , should you - uh - say - uh - who i am - our adventure would end abruptly .

how are you ? how 're you feeling ?

and - uh - i guess , 'goodnight ' .

i hope you realize , bill ... in your office this morning , that was your time .

no --

that 's the best i can do . ... but minute-by-minute , i find myself lingering .

how long have i got ?

i wo n't .

it had n't occurred to me until then . i was just having such a wonderful time -- besides , is n't this what i 'm here for ?

so there 's nothing between you and susan ?

shook me up . i mean that you knew her and everything --

... i 'm sorry , i 'm a little discon- certed , that stuff between you and susan -- uh -- threw me .

no --

the jacket and the pair of pants came with the body i took . let me ask your opinion . do i blend in ?

you 're not death . you 're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants .

death !

yes , bill . the question .

bill . come on . the question . the question you 've been asking yourself with increased regularity , at odd moments , panting through the extra game of handball , when you ran for the plane in delhi , when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning . the question that is in the back of your throat , choking the blood to your brain , ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --

what question ?

what the hell are you talking about ?

'the one ' to do what ?

'take me ' ... ? where ?

i want to have a look around before i take you .

the great bill parrish at a loss for words ? the man from whose lips fall 'rapture ' and 'passion ' and 'obses- sion ' ... all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy ' , what there is no sense 'living your life without ... ' , all the sparks and energy you give off , the rosy advice you dispense in round , pear-shaped tones --

it 's enough now .

no , you 're not . you 're trying to 'handle ' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle .

try . because 'if you have n't tried , you have n't lived ' .

i did n't ask any question .

sir , i 'll deliver the package .

no thank you , quince . i 'm sorry , honey . i 'm no good at this . why do n't you choose whatever cake you like ?

this is great , honey . the orange . has it got a little vodka in it ? like that finnish stuff , orange vodka -- put your lips around this one , bill . it 's out of this world .

joe , you do n't know how glad i am you 're aboard . anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man , i 'm in his corner .

yeah . or the week after .

but i 've got to tell you , if mergers are in the wild , i 've got some great prospects i 've developed . i want to talk to you about them next week .

bontecou day . going to close with big john -- look at you , bill , all cool as a cat and over at bontecou 's , i 'll bet he 's shitting in his pants .

how 's that , quince ?

i am , this is it . b day .

good morning , quince .

sorry , bill , have a drink , eat your cake , blow out the candles and make a wish . talk to you monday . okay ?

no , i 'm going to stay down here , keep my finger in the dike and maybe by monday , the waters could recede .

eddie , hold out all the hope you want but , i promise you , it 's hope- less , it 's over . come on up , let 's get drunk , if i had your shoulder to lean on i might actually enjoy this --

eddie ?

that 's why it 's okay .

but what ?

you were right about joe , he is going somewhere --

c'mon ! the guy 's working with you . you always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --

you do n't know anything about joe --

this is crazy --

because i was sitting in a staff meeting , incredibly bored , my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- joe .

what is the nature of your interest in joe ?

that was wonderful .

it 'll come back , daddy .

nothing .

'be deliriously happy ' . i 'm going to do my upmost --

well , it worries me . i want you to get swept away . i want you to levitate . i want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish .

susan , you 're a hell of a woman . you 've got a great career , you 're beautiful --

do n't get carried away .

probably .

forget about me and mom -- are you going to marry him ?

do you love drew ?

i am . with you .

i thought you were in a meeting -- ?

thank god . now could we go ? let 's get this day started .

you 're only six-five once .

i do n't like to interfere .

hi , honey .

but we 've got time .

you said you liked me .

because i like you so much . now i 've got to go .

i 've got to go --

you never know . lightning could strike .

i 've got patients coming in --

so you 're a one-girl guy ?

i 'm not trying to sharpshoot you , but that 'nothing lasts ' stuff , that 's what was the trouble with honey 's guy . he was fooling around and honey caught him at it . one girlfriend was n't enough for him .

i was just being agreeable , now i 've got to explain why ?

i agree --

nothing lasts .

good morning , i was talking kind of loud there , sorry .

i 've got to get back for the evening shift , so make yourself at home , watch t.v. , whatever . just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed . i never need them all anyway .

66 .

47 .

whatever gets you off .

well , what then ?

that 's right i did , did n't i ?

i 'm sorry , i think i 'm checked in here , but i 've misplaced my key .

so how many rooms am i checked into in this dump ?

why did n't you clean it out ? *

when was i in here ?

hi , leonard .

he 's not my friend , burt . but if he calls , or if he turns up here , then you give me a call in my room , okay ?

as requested .

what 's it like ?

amnesia ?

hiya .

i just want you to tell me how you came by that car .

interested in buying one ?

where 'd you get it ?

i have n't made a strong enough impression .

you think you can bargain with me ? !

i do n't want blood on them .

i do n't know . i 'm sorry .

jimmy grantz . know him ?

who 's your boyfriend ?

what are you here for ?

what ?

they 're not looking for him .

about your whore of a wife ?

do n't say another fucking word !

do n't talk about my wife .

what then ? love ? what would you kill for ? for your wife , right ?

what do you think i am ? ! i 'm not gon na kill someone for money .

i 'm not .

you do n't know , do you ? you 're blissfully ignorant , are n't you ?

somebody 's come . already .

what 's wrong ?

and ?

i 'll go see him .

he went to meet somebody and did n't come back .

she 's gone and the present is trivia , which i can scribble down as notes .

you decided to help me . trust yourself . trust your own judgment . you can question everything , you can never know anything for sure .

course not .

what ?

you know what we have in common ?

they treating you alright ?

i was n't helping you for money .

you know him ?

is that what your little note says ?

so you have information for me ?

we should n't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal .

i 'm not interested in the company position , mr. shelby . i want to know your honest opinion about sammy .

quit it ! * * you 're not a killer , lenny . that 's why * you 're so good at it . *

i should kill you . *

to set yourself a puzzle you wo n't ever solve . you know how many towns , how many * guys called james g ? or john g ? shit , leonard , i 'm a john g .

why would i do that ? *

i thought so too ! i was sure you'd * remember . but you did n't . *

somehow , i 'll know !

she was n't diabetic . you think i don't * know my own wife ? what the fuck is wrong * with you ? *

are you sure ?

sammy was a con man . a faker .

like you 've told yourself . over and over . conditioning yourself to believe . `` learning through repetition '' -

that , and your thing . *

this is a drug deal ? !

well , i hope it 's not as serious as his , 'cos this guy 's dead .

no . do n't worry , i 'm a cop . everything 'll be okay . is he still breathing ?

what 's wrong ?

how do you know this ?

the jaguar 's out front . you did n't even bother to put it around back .

do n't go back in there . there 's a motel out of town .

yeah , well , thanks for the advice .

my wife 's death . i used to work in insurance , we were well covered .

like how 'd you get this car ? that suit ?

i wo n't be happy until you leave town .

happy now ?

yeah , well maybe she 'll make it you . is that it ? you worried she 'll use me against you ?

guys who 'll come after her . guys who 'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend . they 'll want to make somebody pay . maybe she 'll try and make it you .

from who ?

she 's gon na use you . to protect herself .

because she 'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage . she 's already got you staying with her , for fuck 's sake .

who 's she ?

sammy . remember sammy . you told me about sammy .

who the fuck are you ?

fuck you . we shoulda taken his car .

yeah . i think it was your sinister mustache that got him .

give me your keys .

we probably ought to take his car , you know , teach him a lesson .

fucking hope not .

how 'd ya get him in here in the first place ?

why ?

no ! should i ?

you called me . you wanted my help . you know , lenny , i 've had more rewarding friendships than this one . although i do get to keep using the same jokes .

why are you here ?

discount inn . do n't know what room ; have n't got my key .

just for revenge . that 's what keeps me going . it 's all i have .

you 're living .

he took away the woman i love and he took away my memory . he destroyed everything ; my life and my ability to live .

why ?

who ?

it 's weird , but if you do n't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry . you get sort of shaky but you do n't realize you have n't eaten . have i told you about sammy jankis ?

you do n't have to remember to be hungry .

i 'll be waiting . *

this bad cop . he checked you into the * discount inn . then he 's been calling you * for days , sticking envelopes under your * door , telling you shit . *

what cop ?

okay . we clean him up , untie him and * march him out with a gun in his back . *

no . i was in namibia ...

trudy and i are goin ' for gina ...

then that 's it . change the mission statement . crockett stays in . he keeps working up the ladder . the local importers get a pass for the time being .

`` and '' what ?

quarter mile away . we see the lights ...

what do you think ?

good .

... i did n't want you around the crime scene because it 's crawling with federal law enforcement . we do n't know who 's straight up , who 's not ...

i got to talk to my ado ...

they knew about alonzo , < u > before < /u > he made a move on them . they had our operation . they 've cut into us .

you said nazi low-riders ... ?

deal .

i got the item .

all i want to know is the where and the when . spare me mini moves , progress reports and bullshit .

so ... ?

why ?

hola , viejo .

hola , chica .

twenty-eight-point-five .

is it december ?

that 's right .

you know how improbable this is ... ?

i insist .

where 's she now ?

it goes very fast .

you do .

i thought we had to meet the man .

put your guns on the table ... if we wanted you dead , you would no longer be drawing breath in miami . we would n't have brought you all the way here .

you got something to say , jos , let 's hear it .

he did n't . interrogation 's not in our skill set . so c'mon , what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations ?

how 'bout this ? how 'd neptune know where to hit us ? huh ? whose op sec 's got a leak ? yours ?

i 'll be there .

`` extras '' tried to relieve us of your weight ... and by the by , you know of a player in overtown who goes by the name of `` things aquatic '' ?

i am not john wayne . there is no `` s '' on his chest . we get down if the play calls for it . but we are into business and making money .

what 's the point ? it 's going down .

there is `` undercover . '' and there is `` which way is up ? ''

what is going on ... ? !

mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow ...

yeah . cia-level stuff ...

we 're makin ' moves on each other .

... where you 're makin ' a move on the wife of archangel de jesus montoya ?

where the hell are you , man ?

no .

no . you gon na give me phony reassurances ?

like ... ?

anything ?

then it do n't work .

what < u > you < /u > get < u > from < /u > us is a date . a place . `` in the parking lot of a jack-in-the-box in north miami . '' at such-and-such time , an eighteen- wheeler will be there . keys in the ignition . ready to roll . you pick it up . and you drive it ... ... away .

and specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs .

so ?

aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers . so ...

what is it ?

backup in case the russians get physical .

what 's our deal ?

if we were for real , and knew our shit , we 'd fade this one ...

switek ?

i 'm my < u > own < /u > man . and anytime you want to see how much man i am ?

out of ... ?

to recruit you .

we do n't know .

nlr , we think . i wan na know ...

what 's your miami pd badge number ?

they had me from the gate .

i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry , sonny ...

where 's riccardo ?

who are you talking to ?

but miami pd was n't part of the j.i.t . and from what alonzo said , he did n't give you up .

as in , your ass is dead in the water .

we do n't know . and that 's the point . maybe there 's a mole . whatever , it 's a disaster . and it 's a joint interagency task force . i have dea , atf , u.s. customs components in on it . so the penetration could be from any one agency . what we do know is i have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause i have to assume our operational security is blown .

... what else , what else did he indicate to you ? i need to know everything he said .

... you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious , they make mistakes . you 're worried about me . do not be . i am careful . i am cool . i got trudy , backup , whatever . you worry about you . because you are the ones who are in denied territory , not me . if your focus is on me , you 'll miss something coming at you . that 's how people slip up . get hurt . and i 'd die if anything happened . you worry about < u > you < /u > . you and sonny ... are in the dangerous place . i 'm fine ...

... even if they could run the identities you built to epic , all they 'll find is more cover ... trust what you built . it 's quality , girl . we 're cool ...

good idea . we 'll grab a bite .

the bouquet , here . five-hundred dollars worth of roses ... yellow .

nothing . calling to say hi ... what 's up with you ?

what am i supposed to do after i get my nails and hair done ... ?

he did volunteer one time ...

what would you do ... ?

a good deal , like this with us , for burnett will be good only temporarily . he 'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever . life is dust , make it while you can . he 's ambitious .

burnett ? they want 22 % of the value on loads they run into south florida . it 's the juarez cartel model . they guarantee the loads . the upside is our risk goes to zero . that frees-up capital .

jos does n't like the deal in south florida ...

you set this up !

transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd .

i walk into neptune 's house ... very nice . but i also see you ... and our drugs that got ripped from maguda .

they lied .

what the hell did you do ?

you sure you heard what i said ?

no , ma'am , i 'm not .

you sure are a pretty lady .

you gon na beat me , joe ?

cut it out . that 's cheating , teasing me so i ca n't think . just one bitsy y word and i gon na beat you !

okay . never argue with a man .

i know . scribbage !

maybe we should take a little nap , see what happens ?

well , that 's something never happened to me before , you can bet your bottom dollar . uh , where 's the matches , ma'am ?

sure you 're all right ?

i can tell , ca n't you ?

sounds like crap , admit it . and i 'm not gon na have it . i 'm rico all the time , okay , do you blame me ? that 's agreed , okay ? we 're gon na tell all these new people my name 's rico ?

if you have to shiver , why do n't you pull the blanket up more ?

how ' n hell a dumb bronx kid like you know that ?

yeah .

they got ta be .

yeah .

well , i made it . this here is ratso rizzo and i ...

now i 'm here . i 'm in new york city . getting picked for things . do n't you see what i 'm driving at ?

he ca n't read . even dumber than you . could n't write his own name . x -- that 's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone . one big lousy x like our flat . condemned . by order of city hall .

can he smell the difference , eh ?

respect shee-it ! you even steal flowers for his grave .

forty-second street . where ' n hell you think it come from ?

who 'd you ever do a favor for ? you just let some poor bastard freeze to death , would n't you ?

the coat ? a guy i did a favor once gave it to me . christ .

not bad -- for a cowboy -- you 're okay , you 're okay .

do n't rush me . how i do it , see , i get myself primed , like i was turning on the charm for some pretty little blonde lady , then kinda mosey away slow and easy and - swing around ! -- and there you are , you handsome devil .

you like it ? take a look .

well , uh , my manager 's gon na manage all that crap , or else he gon na get a coconut up his flue .

you ai n't got a chance in hell . you need threads and glitter , baby . a front , hey ?

you talk like a man with a tin twat .

shee-it , man , i ca n't say all that .

well , i hope you know what you 're in for . i 'm a very dangerous person . someone does me bad like you . if i caught up with you that night , there 'd be one dead ratso long about now . hear ?

ten , ten -- i got a twenty -- take that ...

well , joe , you 're a nice guy , and i 'd be doing you both a favor , but why ? what 'm i dragging my bum leg all over town for ? it 's no picnic and what for , for me myself , what ?

i think you just put your finger on it , i do .

i simply do n't have it , joe .

oh . yes . of course . i should have thought . you should n't have to ask . that was thoughtless of me . yes . wait here ...

i 'm going to florida .

no , yes . no , i mean yes please go . help me to be good . come back tomorrow . promise .

you want me to leave ?

it 's so exciting . new york . the mad forward thrust of everything . my sense of time here is completely altered .

a drink ? i 've got some nice gin . if you 'd prefer something else , they 'll send it up ...

right here , why not ? i prayed in saloons , i prayed in the street , i prayed an the toilet . he do n't care where , what he wants is that prayer .

get down -- where ?

i got a hunch , joe buck , it 's gon na be easier for you than most .

lonesomeness is something you take . you bear ? dammit , you take it and go about your business , that 's all .

but i 'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys . i 'll bet you 're lonesome .

no . you got it .

this pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built ? ten bucks she wanted . three of us made a deal for , twenty-five , see , big goddam bargain ?

instant v-goddam-d .

he fell . hey , fella , you fell . is he all right ?

what ?

twenty fucking years , man - years ! i figger ten at the least .

could be ten or fifteen . maybe even twenty .

history , man , history . how much ?

yeah ... only the room service is lousy . come on , let me show you the tennis courts .

looks like a cheap hotel .

getchmis olsun

everything .

hey , you know what 's gon na get us out of here ? it 's not a map , max . it 's our balls . you know what i mean ... ... i got ta get laid man , i do n't know 'bout you guys , but if i do n't get it on soon , i 'm ... i 'm not gon na make it .

the prison , man . there was this german cat an architect in the hospital . he was helping the turks build some shit round the place . i laid some bread on him and he let me copy them .

well , it 's an interesting place ... tell you the truth , i think the food is lousy . the crap they sell in these little restaurants . i went out to eat in one of them last night , and i had to run to the damn toilet ... you shoulda ' seen the toilet .

how do you like it ? istanbul ?

nothing . just twisted my ankle .

do n't worry about it . right now money does n't count . okay ?

dad ... i 'll pay you back for all this , i promise .

bad . she could n't make the trip . you know her boy ... susan told us before we got your letter . she 's fine ; she 's trying to get the money to come back and see you , but ...

dad ... i 'm ...

all over . turkish army up there . it 's against the law . they shoot us . you sure you looking for your friends , man ?

two miles ! minefields over there . do you know where this campground is or not ?

sixty lira ?

how far ?

sure .

you know where they are ?

two hundred dollars . it was my last two hundred .

but just ...

you just got to get yourself a good lawyer . and some money ... talk to max . he 's been in the longest .

aslan , there ...

what they give you ?

just erich .

about as good as it looks .

how 's it feel ?

the prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession ; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the high court in ankara reviewed it .

oh shit .

bad . sent to the city hospital . they ruptured his hernia again .

you know where it is ?

i want to cut his throat .

ziat ... what do i got to lose huh ! what do i got to lose . and i 'd really enjoy it .

max ... your billy shirt 's on fire ...

after we 're outside the kogus ?

then we 're outside the kogus . then what ?

what ? you got ta be joking .

we go back .

two thirty .

what time is it ?

get the ... midnight ... express .

take it off ! take it off ! ... s'il vous plait ? ...

no !

you ca n't take anything seriously .

i think i 've been poisoned .

was.. ... seven years old . i was on street in suk . buy . sell . no family to take care . i learn .

but you fuck with me . you fuck with me all the time . you make crummy tea . you rip us off on the hash .

if i get bail , mister yesil , they say it 's easy to cross the border into greece ?

i know exactly what you feel but you must not worry , we are acting immediately , we get the right court , the right judge , i arrange everything - just right . and i think we get you bail . if very bad , maybe twenty month sentence ... but i think we get you bail ...

weird shit ... ?

did they get the sleazebag who owns this place ?

immigration 's gon na love you for that .

selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates ...

the blintzes ! `` try the blintzes ... ''

i think so . one right , two lefts ...

track bunnies . rats . they 're usually around .

funny . shoulda seen some track bunnies by now .

you all watch your step . we got some burrows goin ' down seven stories here . you fall , i do n't wan na have to come pick you up .

you gon na finally get to fuck around with the wires . think you can handle it ?

you feel anything ?

oh , jesus ! !

fuck you , wait a minute . i 'm going to-

what ?

well ... there 's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks . ai n't gon na be much use , though . lines are dead .

did you see the size of that thing ? !

we 'll be back at the platform in ...

no , you talkin ' at me .

please do . he 's a lonely guy .

the department of public health ...

what 's manny doing ? i ca n't see him anymore .

hey , hey ! ! take it easy ! !

you better tell me what the hell 's going on here !

hurry , the woman needs help !

my god , what the hell are you ... ?

he can imitate anything , you just watch him .

we 're no leaving you !

across both tracks ! !

he did n't do it !

but the power ...

he 's out there . i heard him . how can he be ? this things ...

peter-

they do n't know anything peter , they just sense . they 're hardwired !

no .

i get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids .

no such thing , baby .

great crowd .

i heard how you talked to him .

honey , just leave it .

metaxonycha godmani .

okay . so you lost a great specimen-

i 'll be late .

okay , meet me out front . i got ta go . josh 's picking me up in five . see you tonight .

no way . i see one of those , i 'd puke .

an `` ootheca '' . an eggcase . it probably had more , uh `` weirdbugs '' inside .

you guys have done a nice job . how bout five dollars ?

that 's impossible . insects do n't ...

and they 're not fully developed . this thing 's not even an adult .

no shit .

it bit you .

i 'd be delighted . now that you know the way ...

sure .

sorry , did n't mean to startle you . you did n't give me a chance to knock .

you did perfect . except for one thing . this time we need two glasses .

i 'm almost done .

you 'll know very soon . i 'm starting the last chapter . and when i finish , i want everything to be perfect . i 'll require three things .

oh , paul . i 'm dying . does she wind up with ian or windthorne ? you have to tell me .

i 'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you 're not nicer --

oh , no reason , you keep me prisoner , you make me burn my book , you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles ...

paul , do n't you think it 's time for you to start writing again ? it 's been over a week .

when you first came here , i only loved the writer part of paul sheldon . but now i know i love the rest of him too . as much as misery loves ian . i know you do n't love me -- do n't say you do -- you 're a beautiful , brilliant , famous man of the world ; and i 'm ... not a movie star type . you 'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you 're someone like me .

annie , what is it ?

oh , god , what have i done ? i 'm so sorry , paul . i ruined your beautiful toast . will you ever forgive me ? here , let me pour another one . can we pretend this never happened ? to misery ?

are you kidding ? if anyone ever told me that one day i 'd be having a candlelit dinner with paul sheldon in my own house , i woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled . will this do ?

a toast ?

i 've never had meatloaf this good , what do you do to it ?

i 'm going to play my records all day

whenever he played radio city , who do you think was right there in the front row ?

oh , paul , can i read each chapter when you finish ? i can fill in the `` n '' s. will she be her old self , now that ian has dug her out , or will she have amnesia ... ?

i said that ?

i 'm telling you , i ca n't .

i know that , mister man -- they also call them serials . i 'm not stupid , you know . anyway , my favorite was rocket man , and once it was a no-brakes chapter , the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out , but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and -- i was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe i was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was rocket man trying to get out , and here came the cliff and just before the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered -- -- but i did n't cheer , i stood right up and started shouting , `` this is n't what happened last week -- have you all got amnesia ? -- they just cheated us -- this was n't fair -- ''

that 's right -- when i was growing up in bakersfield , my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on saturday afternoons for the chapter plays ...

i really value your criticism , but maybe you 're being a little hasty here .

i 'm sorry , paul . this is all wrong , you 'll have to do it over again .

you know goddamn well what i 've been doing -- i 've been sitting here suffering . i need my pills .

what 's the matter ? i 'll tell you what 's the matter . i go out of my way for you . i do everything to try and make you happy . i feed you , i clean you , i dress you . and what thanks do i get ? `` you bought the wrong paper , annie . i ca n't write on this paper , annie . '' well , i 'll get your stupid paper , but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here , mister man .

no , just the paper will be fine .

c'mere , i 'll show you .

but mine cost the most so i do n't see how it could smudge .

it 's two of the letters in my favorite nurse 's name , annie .

do n't worry about that . you 'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work .

work ? you mean write ? what in the world do you think i 'd write ?

i do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year . people say it has something to do with the ozone layer . what do you think ?

then light the match , paul .

i know this may be difficult for you , but it 's for the best .

i do n't suppose i could have a little snack while i wait for the surprise ?

then who did ?

well , i hope you like it .

no problem .

the sistine chapel ?

my pleasure .

no . no , it is n't , it 's -- -- oh pooh , i ca n't think of any words . would `` great '' be insulting ?

then the roads are open ...

they had it at the store , paul , there was a whole batch of them there . as soon as i saw it , i slammed my money down . i got the first copy .

oh , i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to wake you .

well , these are slum kids , i was a slum kid , everybody talks like that .

well , it 's brilliantly written , but then everything you write is brilliant .

say that last part again , i did n't quite hear --

your legs just sing grand opera when you move , do n't they ? it 's not going to hurt forever , paul , i promise you .

what thing ?

`` there is a justice higher than that of man -- i will be judged by him . ''

there 's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars : the ones that ca n't afford new ones , and the ones who would n't give 'em up for anything in the world . that second bunch do n't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents .

he might well be . but not the way they say . he did n't crawl out of that car by himself . you saw those dents on the door -- someone pulled him out .

what ? what is it ?

stop -- stop right here .

yes .

nothing unusual about mr. sheldon 's leaving , buster -- you can tell by the champagne .

has she been buying any odd things lately ?

i am . well , maybe not completely --

now you 've hurt me , paul .

did they win ?

marcia , please .

not a bad business . this thing would still be growing , too . the first printing order on misery 's child was the most ever -- over a million .

an old friend . i was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there . like it was waiting for me .

sean , please..

well , you 've thorough about it , at any rate .

feel like pleading for your life ?

ulrich will be about . he 'll look after you .

a change of plans ?

to win ?

say no more . i 'm off to grab a drink . still favor bellinis ?

maybe that 's it , then . everything 's upside down and backwards ...

and my room ?

in other words , you 're calling her a flake .

than thirty-seven million pounds ? not really .

checkpoint charlie plus 30 , altitude minus two-zero-thousand . airspeed one-seven- niner knots..

well do you disagree with that ?

- or hard wired , right . first line of perimeter defence 'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house . whatever moves burps or bleep is gon na be picked up to a height of twenty feet . basically impenetrable , i 'd say .

that 's it ? that 's it ? that 's it ?

there she is . i got visual .

package away in five..four..three.. two..one ...

there guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill ?

what can we do ' mate ?

how 're we doin ' , then ?

five and a half minutes . he 's breached the hot zone..

i am . she is .

he 's heading down the stairs , now..

no . you just looked as if you did .

no . should i ?

then you 'll have to kill me before it 's too late . before i start killing people .

i guess i lied..you ca n't get both of us out of here , can you ?

nyah , it 's very important not do anything to alarm ambrose..

it 's going to be okay .

i am now . get me out of here . just get me out of here .

he 's touched your heart . you 're overwhelmed . you need to think it over . you 'll meet him somewhere in a month . if you 're not out in 48 hours i 'm coming in and getting you out . give me the ear piece .

nyah , you 've done more than enough . even the best of snake charmers get bit .

i want < i > you out of there. < /i >

i managed .

i 'll muddle through .

ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the london times . what 's that about ?

i 've no doubt .

- michael , his driver 's an aussie , new to me . then there 's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house .

just like old times ?

ethan , you take care of yourself , i 'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove , i 'm gon na bail - and without giving two week notice .

he 's got you on qantas flight 2735. it 's going to be delayed .

probably that i needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind i could n't possible sort out myself..

what would n't make him suspicious ?

sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-i'm- not-nad ' message . not after the way we broke up .

generally , i do n't favor coercing someone . not when there 's a chance my life could end up in their hands .

so would i. but it 's not mine to give .

i 'd like a little more conviction..

not that it matter much but..i seem to recall you staying something like , ' i was hoping we could work together . '

that 's lot of people out there..how many of them , i wonder , are capable of something like that ?

damn , you 're beautiful .

that they 're lying .

not revealing information does n't necessarily make someone a liar .

i need your help and i thin you can use mine .

hi . would you mind slowing down ?

at least you walked .

far right .

think you 're the only one who can pick a lock ?

look , it 's either you or the rent and i do n't mind telling you it 's not an easy choice .

no . you just looked as if you did .

and that appears to have been destroyed . it also contained the anti-virus , bellerophon .

yes .

of course it was . anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do , is bound to get a little flak here and there . you try flogging the stories on cnn i 've had to come up with about what 's been going on around here the last few days . at any rate , it 's been most instructive -- what they 'll swallow , or what they 'll broadcast with a straight face . miss hall 's blood , it appears , has absolutely no elements of the chimera virus . not even antibodies .

why not ? you 've done just about everything else on this operation .

no . i ca n't afford to be curious . and neither can you , hunt..

you mean that leaves miss hall .

but that leaves another seven or eight pints of chimera .

you mean it 'll be difficult .

and then what ?

right now only ambrose knows that .

whatever nekhorvich was carrying sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it .

like it 's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry . and a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier . so let 's get on with it . he 's still in sydney ?

you got ta be kidding .

why did you phrase it like that ?

sorry it could n't be under happier circumstances .

they 're ready and waiting . you 'll soon be with old friends .

well , yes . i suppose i am a bit anxious .

she 's on the north head bluff - approaching the cliffs . one klick away .

nyah still on the property ?

i told her to get outta there .

left jacket pocket confirmed .

roger that .

right . i guess there are n't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer .

that simple , huh ?

nekhorvich specialized in recombining dna molecules . in the myth , bellerophon killed chimera , a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world . i think nekhorvich has created a monster virus in chimera and apparently the means to kill it in bellerophon .

put in the coordinates and let 's get a visual . the visuals are n't coming up .

you still do n't get it , do you ? you want to make an omelet , you break a few eggs - < i > i needed to know just how bad the disease was < /i > - in the real world , not the lab . and you never know til you try . you thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas . but i saw you creating a disease so terrible in < i > chimera < /i > that the cure would be priceless .

a visit from an old friend .

his name is ... ..dimitri miediev .

you asked for my help . you < u > asked < /u > for < u > my < /u > help ... come on ...

c'mon , c'mon , tell the truth ... c'mon .

i do n't remember what happened ! we were at the bar , drinking , laughing -- having fun .

i dont know . it didnt say on the tickets .

s.o.p..

now we dont have to eliminate him ? you like that , dont you claire ? dont you ?

well claire do you ? have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them ?

course he did . just exactly when he knew is something of a question . before or after i showed in london , mind telling me , ethan ?

may take a little time .

is he serious ?

claire .

ethan ?

okay ...

kittridge ...

i 'm so sorry . krieger was my call . i 've never worked with him . i 'm sorry , ethan .

what about you ?

you did n't have to ... ... ...

we need help , and we do n't have time . they have to be local .

you 're sure about this ?

take off your god damn coat !

what ?

they 're dead . jim 's dead .

you were in the car !

do n't move .

i do n't know , ethan . suppose you tell me ?

i see you 've been out visiting the folks .

how about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and i wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole .

correct the actual list is safe at langley . `` golitsyn '' was a lightning rod , one of ours .

you 're right . maybe this 'll save some time .

let 's see if you can follow me around this room . the drunk russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock ... the couple waltzing around me at the embassy at 9 and 11. the waiter behind hannah at the top of the staircase - bowtie , 12 o'clock . the other imf team . you 're worried about me . < u > why < /u > ?

of imf agents . at the embassy . tonight .

yes . i see your point .

passport , visas - you know the drill . we 'll work the exfiltration thru canada , debrief you at langley . throw the prague police a bone , you know toss them a few suspects . follow me ?

yeah .

youre in prague ?

< u > are you intact < /u > ?

whos dead ?

theyre dead .

why do n't you come back with me ?

about what ?

it 's hard to tell . i 'm gon na have to be close .

exactly , that 's your job . tomorrow on the train , you ca n't let this list get out into the open . what 's the range of this thing ?

i 'm not letting this list get out in the open .

luther , relax , it 's worse than you think . the terminal 's in black vault lock-down .

thinking machine laptops , i 'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- < u > with < /u > the artificial intelligence risk chip --

what kind ?

i would n't dream of it .

i 'm going to have to front you personally . do n't lose that money without losing your life .

how will you make sure i 'll have the list in three days ? it 's been a delight . now where can i drop you dear boy ?

six million dollars . i 'll give you the same . but i want the complete list now , not just eastern europe . i wo n't do this piecemeal , it 's too dangerous . i want the < u > entire < /u > list , the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world .

very good .

tell you what . how good 's the rf scanner you used in the car ?

whether you like a paradox . i want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars .

the penny drops . < u > you < /u > are < u > not < /u > job . yes , job is not given to quoting scripture in his communications . and there was its tone -- aggressive but playful . job is not playful . so you 're something of a paradox .

i need one hundred thousand dollars .

do you < u > want < /u > to blow the fire through the whole building ?

nobody goes into any sector where the alarm did n't go off .

time up .

we 'll see .

roger that . opening doors now .

jack . jack .

just do n't chew it .

is there any particular reason we 're not out of here yet ? !

sarah eye on the package . jim , im coming to you .

allowing max to see you and hear what you 've got to say .

then what am i doing here ?

tell me something claire , that night in prague , was it you or jim that blew up the car and scattered hannah all over town ?

they stamped it , didnt they ? those damn gideons .

what he didnt get in prague . the noc list .

we dont have to , jim . hell come after us .

how did kittridge do it ? ..

kitteridge . oh my god ! kittridge is the mole ?

jim , who do you think you 're kidding ? a doctor 's got ta look at that . you ca n't sit up straight .

- and picked us up in the states -

where are you ?

can you lose him ?

what the hell 's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time ? claire 's in a weird mood too .

look to your right , then back to me . there 's a camera built right into the bridge . whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here . can you hear me ?

its working .

is something wrong with the phone ? well is something wrong with the batteries ?

this wasnt what we discussed .

how long until we reach the chunnel ?

thirty-two and change .

that 's not so good for you , my friend .

twenty-six , twenty-seven . so far so good .

then , i suppose the time has come say it 's been nice dwight lionel . it 's been everything . oh , dwight , i 'm frightened .

uh-huh

very good , mr. johnny .

a man ... under stands one day ... that his life is built on nothing . and that 's a bad , crazy day .

have i been a good wife ?

i do n't wan na talk about it .

you have n't said anything .

what are you doing here ?

everything is temporary . that do n't excuse nothing .

more bad luck ! i do n't like his face , loretta . i do n't like his lips . when he smiles i ca n't see his teeth . when will you do it ?

him ? he 's a big baby . why is n't he here with you telling me ?

no ! bad luck ! your ma and i been married fifty-two years an nobody died . you were married , what , two years , and somebody is dead . do n't get married again , loretta . it do n't work out for you . who 's the man ?

he got hit by a bus .

ti amo .

pop , i got news .

where 's ma ?

i brought you something .

and then there is copper , which is the only pipe i use . it costs money . but it costs money because it saves money .

hurry up , hurry up . we open in five minutes .

hurry up .

you have too many dogs .

what do you want me to do ? pick up after five dogs ? i 'm eighty-three years old . god in his heaven understands that i can not pick up after five dogs .

before all these people , yes , i will marry you , ronny cammareri !

will you marry me .

loretta ?

loretta , what are you talking about ?

ronny !

no .

let me go home .

yeah .

i went with you . now i 'm gon na marry johnny and you 're gon na leave me alone . right ? a person can see where they 've messed up in their life , and they can change how they do things , and they can change their luck . maybe my nature does draw me to you , but i do n't haveta go with that . i can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that 's just gon na ruin everything ! i can do that . otherwise , what is this stupid life that god gave us for what ? ronny ? are you listening to me ?

he did n't come !

what do you want to do now ?

no thanks .

thank you !

kinda gaudy .

hi .

alright . where 's the met ?

i 'm in love with you !

last night never happened , you hear me ? i 'm gon na marry him anyway and last night never happened , and you and i are gon na take this to our coffins !

all right , i 'm guilty . i confess !

this time i was trying to do everything right .

that light .

your blood .

me neither .

a wolf without a foot !

he made me look the wrong way and i cut off my hand . he could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head !

i 'm a wolf ?

yes .

stupid .

i do n't know .

when you get engaged ?

he knew my husband who died .

loretta . what 's that smell ?

i do n't understand .

i have no life . my brother johnny took my life from me .

let me come and talk to you .

yeah , i 'll be in .

bye , aunt rita .

what ?

what ?

johnny , i have something to tell you .

well . i told my mother that we were to be married . and she got well . right away .

the waitresses were very nice . my mother is slipping away .

i 'll take care of it , johnny . i 'll take care of the whole thing . all you have to do is show up .

yeah .

alright . a month . in a month .

then let 's set the date .

what time is it ?

we got married at the city hall and i think it gave bad luck the whole marriage .

what do you mean ?

will you marry me ?

it 's the oily fish tonight . not before the plane ride .

no ?

you do n't want the fish .

she recovered .

he 's with his dying mother !

no . but i have a hangover .

no . are you drunk ?

are you drunk ?

a wife knows .

what ! how do you know ?

i do n't wan na talk about it .

not yet . that old lady makes him sweat . where 's that card ?

did he tell her ?

what 's thirty-seven ? i had chiro after i was thirty-seven . it ai n't over till it 's over .

grandma was still alive . chiro was still home going to school . now he 's married and gone to florida . if you and johnny moved in , had a baby ...

pop .

good . when you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can . but you like him ?

no .

the bank . oh my god , i forgot to make the deposit !

hi . why ai n't you at the store ?

hi .

i will . but i must find the right moment .

talk to him .

if i hit the stick too hard , the apple will split . if i am too timid , the apple will fall off the stick .

he owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none .

i do n't know .

that 's it ! that 's the reason !

who was that ?

out . i do n't know where . i was waiting up for my husband .

she 's not home yet . take off your coat and come in the living room . i 'll make you a drink . i wan na talk to you .

come on in .

moving in ?

you 're forty-two years old , johnny , and mama is still running your life .

because my mother was dying ! but now she 's not .

well . yeah . you may not want to .

johnny ...

when i was twenty-seven years old , in jersey city , i asked a woman to marry me . she had red hair . she smelled a jasmine . she wore black shoes with pointy white tips .

may i presume to ask you a question ?

but absolutely !

no . i think the house is empty . i ca n't invite you in because i 'm married and because i know who i am . you 're shaking .

no .

may i walk with you a ways ?

what you do n't know about women is a lot .

maybe . listen . you wan na know why i chase women ? i find women charming .

nerves .

go ahead .

then why are you eating alone ?

will you join me for dinner ?

none of your business .

i 'm not disturbed . by you .

it 's a house .

my god , it 's a mansion !

you see that moon last night ?

raymond , raymond , lower your voice ! what 's got into you ?

and what do you burn , apart from witches ?

there are ? tell up . what are they , wise sir bedevere ?

did you dress her up like this ?

what ? a swallow carrying a coconut ?

seek you the bridge of death ...

the lady of the lake , her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite , held excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by divine providence ... that i , arthur , was to carry excalibur ... that is why i am your king ! | | old woman | is frank in ? he 'd be able to deal with this one . | dennis look , strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that 's no basis for a system of government . supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses , not from some farcical aquatic ceremony .

well , i did n't vote for you .

i am your king !

we do n't have a lord .

king of the who ?

what word ?

cut down a tree with a herring ? it ca n't be done !

oh , knights of ni , here is your shrubbery . may we go now ?

oh !

we are the keepers of the sacred words . ni ... peng ... and neee ... wom !

the black knight always triumphs . have at you !

i 'll do you for that .

look !

had enough ?

i move for no man .

what ?

well ... can we come up and have a look ?

are you sure he 's got one ?

well , i 'll ask him , but i do n't think he 'll be very keen . he 's already got one , you see ?

this is the castle of of my master , guy de loimbard .

i am king arthur and these are the knights of the round table . whose castle is this ?

hello .

oh , just some friends !

ni !

this new learning amazes me , sir bedevere . explain again how sheep 's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes .

who did we lose ?

je ... sus christ !

what ?

there he is !

what ?

follow !

look , you 're a busy man ...

a grail ?

you know my name ?

greetings tim the enchanter !

there are some who call me tim ?

what manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder ?

come and see the violence inherent in the system . help , help , i 'm being repressed !

shut up , will you . shut up !

you ca n't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you !

yes , i see .

you did n't bother to find out , did you ?

i did n't know you were called dennis .

well you could say : `` dennis ''

what ?

man . i 'm sorry . old man , what knight live in that castle over there ?

well , do n't . | i really do n't know where all this got started . it 's like those miserable psalms . they 're so depressing . now knock it of

and do n't apologize . every time i try to talk to someone it 's sorry this and forgive me that and i 'm not worthy and ... what are you doing now ?

sorry ...

and therefore ?

ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone ?

the nose ?

i feel fine .

i 'm getting better !

i 'm not dead !

right . off you go .

what is your favorite colour ?

who approaches the bridge of death must answer me these questions three ! ere the other side he see .

that 's easy !

why ?

when 's your next round ?

'ere . he says he 's not dead .

really , i feel fine , sir .

i will send help , brave friend , as soon as i have accomplished this most daring , desperate adventure in this genre .

i think i 'll be all right to come with you , sir .

oh , well ... er brave concorde ! you shall not have been fatally wounded in vain !

i 'm not quite dead , sir ...

at last ! a call ! a cry of distress ... concorde ! brave , concorde ... you shall not have died in vain !

oh , do n't worry about that ... tell me ... does n't camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains ?

it 's just that when i 'm in this genre , i tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...

'mm ... very nice castle , camelot ... very good pig country ... .

camelot ? are you from camelot ?

oh dear , i did n't really mean to ...

you killed eight wedding guests in all !

how ?

hurry , brave sir launcelot !

who are you ?

but , father .

rather what ?

father , lad .

oh , i see , right .

is that clear ?

just you ...

oh , i remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us ?

er ... if ... we ... er ...

no . until i come and get him .

well look , i 'm afraid i really ought to be ...

the castle anthrax ?

ector .

... i bet you 're gay .

look , let me go back in there and face the peril ?

you were , sir galahad , you were in terrible peril .

we 'll cover your escape !

camelot ...

no , no , this can not be . i am sworn to chastity !

they 're doctors ?

i 'm ... er ... sir launcelot , sir .

they 're all saying the word ...

a path ! a little path for the late knights of ni !

i done it again .

brave , sir rob ...

be careful who sees it .

she 'll get over it .

i 'm getting dressed .

she 'll think it 's her fault for keeping me .

i 'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan i 'd be wearing anyway . that 's as much as a page of the back stairs gets and that job 's only for toffs . i 'm her majesty 's highland servant ! indoors and out . there 's no stopping me now .

she 's got an army of people to get her up and out .

you work the system right , you could ask her yourself . just be thankful you 're not working for household . the queen never lets them out of her sight . but wee spats like us can slip through the net , easy .

three years , john . is that not a bit long to be grieving ?

sixty .

how much ?

so what did ponsonby do when she started shouting ?

not down south you do n't .

checked and locked , sir .

i hope to go up next year .

mary taylor , sir .

what 's your name ?

mr brown , sir --

quite .

my concern is for the reputation of the monarchy .

mr disraeli . ma'am .

well , everyone 's entitled to their opinion .

do you know who you address , sir ?

i said , are you deaf as well as stupid ?

she 's away to windsor tomorrow . talk to her there .

and that is my last word on the matter .

brown 's responsibilities are onerous enough already . he has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed . the smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock .

i do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me . doctor jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box !

no dinners , bertie . why are you dressed for outdoors ?

my own .

this is a slur on her good name .

that can wait till the weekend .

yes , it most certainly is !

well , you tell her majesty from me , if her husband was here now , he 'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her . what the hell 's the point in me being here otherwise ? !

no .

you will await your orders like everyone else . unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday 's little excitement .

you do not report for duty unless the queen requests it . you know that very well .

yes . i do .

do you ?

i came down at the queen 's request . i 'll take my orders from her .

i 'm sure it wo n't be difficult to find you .

who 'll bring it to me ?

she 'll think i betrayed her .

i promised to protect her from people like you .

the greasy pole .

her mind is set . she wo n't change now .

so ... ?

ah , but therein lies the paradox . it is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents . the longer she is away , the stronger they become ; and who , honestly , can promise security against that ? however many doors you lock , someone will always get in . even here .

aye .

for her majesty .

why ?

then i envy yo .

what i do , i do for my queen .

you 're injured .

i do n't think about it .

i am a blank sheet .

because i have to !

-- you stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me !

i do not accept .

having considered my position here at court , i have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of your majesty that i should resign .

yes , ma'am .

has someone seen to those bruises ?

yes , ma'am .

yes , ma'am ?

what is it , john ? john ?

to keep out the cold .

i do n't groom a horse to have it admired by others , i groom it because it needs grooming .

are they worth reading ?

craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich .

what ?

aye , ma'am .

sir henry is not alone . they all wish it . the same people who refused to grant my husband the title of king because he was deemed of insufficient rank --

prince albert was going to build a bench here . he thought it one of the best views in osborne .

you have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so .

yes . that will be company for you .

i 've no family , ma'am , apart from my brothers and sisters .

your family sent cards . it was much appreciated .

oh , several things .

i beg your pardon ?

not at all , dean . good of you to spare the time .

this is my good john brown .

is that not enough ?

i was trying to imagine `` rather upset . ''

surely , you 're not suggesting we dispense --

some young page was boasting about having seen it . lucky .

quite . i think i 'd best take it back .

yes .

the queen wishes to publish an account of him .

not too protracted , i hope .

a fine choice , sir .

i did not consider it wise , in the circumstances , to tax your nerves .

why was i not informed ?

excellent , ma'am , excellent . but perhaps if her majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity ...

why was i not told earlier ?

the royal family and senior members of the household , ma'am .

they are demanding the dismissal of john brown on grounds of drunkeness .

from whom ?

he thought , perhaps , your majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government .

please make sure it does not happen again .

what is the matter with him ?

then why are you not with him ?

why is he not here ?

where is my son ?

if i tell you , then it 's no fun .

how do you stop the screamer ?

it 's a tough game . hard to pin that bastard down . keeps on changing the rules .

maybe he 's not dead .

dead ?

how do you do that ?

you do n't like it ?

security camera . pulled your files before i came down . be careful what you say , kids ... i know where you live .

but you always lie , so you did n't come from there . that means the city on the left must be the city of truth .

sick ?

christ ... no time ...

we do n't have a choice !

right , then ...

do n't even say it .

one . in case ...

i already have a boyfriend , nick .

yes i am ...

what are you looking for ?

i 've been thinking about that . arcade 's like a virus , so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started . you know , like his point of origin ?

everything .

i ca n't believe you made it !

what are you going to do ?

go outside , get your car , and meet me out front with the engine running . and make it quick , okay ?

what alex is trying to say is that it `` seems '' like it 's alive .

and beat it at it 's own game .

the police , then ...

anywhere . we have to stop it from getting out .

like the fractals ?

that 's what i thought .

where to now ?

sure .

it 's the middle of the night . they 're asleep . phone did n't wake them .

call the others . laurie , benz ...

sorry . maybe i need the valium .

no it did n't . it 's just a faulty relay or something . it happens .

see , men always do this . `` quiet down , honey . chill out . take a valium '' . i 'm not a fucking idiot , nick ! i did not imagine it ! ! !

it is .

no . look , i know you 're not going to believe me , but listen anyway ... i think the game 's alive somehow .

turn if off !

but he was playing the game . i mean , you saw him ...

and then keep on driving ?

it 's here ! ! !

it 's the wrong way !

thought so .

yes ...

think ! i want to go to the city of truth , and the truth teller is from there ... but which one is which ? the liar ... think !

is that your question ?

mom ? you 're alive ...

the air-force is working on the same thing .

the game will guide you .

so what 's the scenario ? am i saving a princess ? fighting zombies ?

a man after my own heart . straight to the point . what 's different about arcade is the way it reacts . it responds like a human does . it learns . it adapts . each time you play , it changes its strategy .

so start at the beginning ...

i understand , cynthia and thank you for the offer . i 'll find a place . now go ahead and give the cowboy a yodel and get back to me .

i 'm just offering a place to stay .

i 'll call him , then call you back ... if you want you could stay at my place .

beverly hills hotel . i 've got enough cash in my pocket for one night .

i know , but you 're broke . where are you ?

and ?

someone 's shut off my money !

home ! meet me at the office . we 've got to do something ... you 've got to do something adam !

i 'm going home .

no .

what did you say ?

you 're an understandin ' fella .

good then , but , just in case , that bank 's gon na stay closed a bit longer . you understand that ?

so let 's just say i 'm drivin ' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me .

well , just stop for a little second and think about it . will ya do that for me ?

that a man 's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be .

i agree with what you said ... truly .

beautiful night .

have a good evening , mr. kesher .

that 's fine , mr. kesher . you can pay cash when you check out . i 'm sorry . it was my duty to inform you .

so , what did they say ?

how ... how 'd they know i was here ?

sorry to trouble you , coco .

sweetie , look at me straight .

i can hardly wait , coco .

well then , take a seat everyone . betty why do n't you join jimmy and we 'll play the scene . is there anything you 'd like to say bob ... something to betty before they begin ?

no , no , i 'm fine .

betty elms ?

i came back . i thought that 's what you wanted .

you 're still here ?

betty .

i want to play this one close , bob . like it was with that girl , what 's her name , with the black hair . that felt good . whaddya think ?

just tell me where it hurts , baby .

was anyone hurt ?

hi . i 'm inquiring ... well , i heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and i want to know if there was an accident on mulholland drive .

diane ?

hey , let 's introduce the brand new you to hollywood . we have n't seen the roof garden yet .

rita ... i know what you 're doing .

c'mon help me in . i 'll open the front door .

i do n't think ...

keep going . go around to the back .

those men in front , in the car .

you 've got to eat something . you 're just nervous about going over to see if you 're diane selwyn .

i 'm all right .

`` you know what i want ... it 's not that difficult . ''

maybe the voice is n't diane selwyn . maybe that 's your roommate or if it is diane selwyn she can tell you who you are .

there 's nothing ?

we could call anonymously from a pay phone ... just to see if there was an accident .

how do you remember how to talk ?

what do you mean ?

i do n't know who i am .

yes , sir .

you see what i mean ...

i had a dream about this place .

go ahead .

where at ?

yeah ... and they both use the same address .

find out who they are ?

handstitched italian . filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the caddy .

could be unrelated .

making ends meet , huh .

you 'll keep your eyes open for me wo n't you baby ?

no . i have n't seen any .

great.. great . is there any kind of hint or anything ?

good morning . what do you have today ?

yeah , i 'd say that 's it .

apparently pretty high , we just got a new ceo last week .

there 's one more person here for me to visit .

yes .

it 's poison gas , this is the antidote . drink it .

you do n't . it 's random , there no trick .

just remember , hold your breath as long as you can . then go right over to that corner . the door will open and go in and up .

i 've since changed my mind . i designed this place , based on my belief that i was doing what the legal system could n't or would n't do . mccay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills . it 's a tax write off . on the books everything looks kosher . i have an office on 5th that i have n't seen in ten years .

i do a very thorough background check . i go through police files , personel files , anything .

but how do you know if the people are guilty ?

i was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine . i was originally brought in as a technical advisor . first bank had sponsored my scholarships .

i just graduated from m.i.t . in engineering . that 's when john mccay hired me .

do you have something better to talk about ?

how long till the room fills ?

once the room depletes it 's oxygen , we have about 30 seconds , then a door opens on the bottom over there . then we swim out .

not listening !

you 've been doing a bang up job so far . right now matt is probably dead and it 's your fault .

i 'm leaving .

it 's a tax write off for john c. mccay .

we have to climb up that .

embezzling ? i 'm not embezzling !

why should we trust you ?

almost . look , you two get out of here .

thanks ...

ow ...

you okay ?

that 's cute asshole .

why do n't you tell us a little about yourself ?

i did , but this room has four exits and only one opens , it 's up to them in the control room . there 's one right over there . the exit light is on , but he can change it .

give me one good reason why i do n't plug you right here , right now ?

either you 'll be shot with bullets , impaled with a large spike , or nailed like a super model . basically you 're fucked any way you go .

trust me , if you open any door , you 'll be dead a whole lot sooner .

are you matthew parker ?

why do n't you just stop fucking around and just die !

matthew lives on the upper west side , kinda posh for a temp do n't you think ?

i see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months . each one in the amount of $ 100,000 . he then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account .

no .

i 've been working with you for four years , do n't you think that 's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?

not down here . i 'll start trusting you when i feel there the time is right . it 's not personal , it 's just survival .

respect is earned not given away , trust is given away to anybody .

when i think you 're ready .

he 'll never get it right . try the log ride !

yes , sir mom .

if you want , i can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people . which will it be ?

excuse me , sir ?

sir ? we 're moving them right along as fast as we can .

fantastic ! a little faster sweetheart .

sir ?

that my boy , is the best part . life on top of the world is boring ... predictable . if i wanted life without chances , i never would have paid for murderland . now go . make a formal proposal and see about the assistant . find out if it 's viable .

john , sir .

do you think the assistant , what 's his name ...

what then sir ? what would we do with the park with out bruce ?

i 'm willing to bet that even the creator ca n't out wit his creation .

sir , he created the park . he would know how to circumvent any of the traps .

what about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the `` park '' ? was n't that a computer glitch ?

i do n't believe ol ' bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did . he still insists on the `` guests '' being of the more nefarious type .

i want more action . i want to see more ingenuity than that . i want to see the injured man out wit the machines !

son , let 's watch the tape .

thank you , sir .

zach my boy , i can spend your yearly salary in a blink . i have had that kind of money all of my life . if i wanted to , i could fly to paris for the afternoon . my father formed this company over seventy years ago . when my brother became mentally challenged , it was put in my charge . now running a bank of this size is very stressful . i need to relax on what little down time i have . a yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline . understand ?

and how much do we pay you annually ?

while i am not morally against these little , shall we say `` hobbies '' , as long as i am on the payroll , but why not something like a yacht club ?

i thought that was darwin , sir . or perhaps nietzsche ?

yeah , right . he 's stuck all the way over here

the power went out in half the park .

so what 's next ? no one 's ever made it this far before .

thank you very much .

ach ! how will you know if they 've made it ?

look ! look !

look he figured it out !

i have a turn for the worse for the team !

what was that ?

so who are these people with the boss ?

i had hoped you would say that . i have a proposal for you ... ..

have you ever considered running your own `` park '' ? i mean , since you will not be returning to your former profession .

then what do you want ?

i thought , and correct me if i 'm wrong , but were n't you trying to play both sides ?

we have new `` guests '' for the park . i have a file on them . may i see bruce ?

i 'm just looking for our best interests . may i have the tapes , bruce ?

thanks a lot . i always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight .

where are we ?

what now ?

sweet jesus i never dreamed i 'd be glad to see central park at night .

`` how 's your foot '' ? this guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place , and you want to know how his foot is ?

how 's your foot ?

i 'm talking to you asshole !

no ! just get up . this is serious .

wake up , we 're in trouble .

yahoo ! ! ! ! !

hi . i brought some wine .

yes .

come on , i 'm serious . look at wilma . she 's this frail little thing , and fred , i mean fred flintstone is this big guy . he has to be hung like a horse , and that 's why wilma puts up with his b.s .

i meant him .

i disagree . i think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can ... ..

were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ? i am sorry . perhaps we should have dinner tonight to ... . discuss your future .

four years . i came over from the capitol merger in chicago six months ago .

i am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market . how long have you been with the company now ?

no they 're not . i wan na be a writer , i wan na be just like you .

oh i doubt it ... lectures are notoriously boring .

are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem .

excuse me i asked you a question .

you 're still asking me to break the law .

well maybe you should join a hippie commune . but let me tell you something . sooner or later it 's gon na be your turn to take out the garbage .

do you wan na be a hall monitor all your life ?

his name is jeffrey pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 ford pickup , black with red interior . please ?

suspended from school , my mother ? ?

you kidding ? he picks up a picture and shows vada and nick

can i see him ?

we have a baby ?

totally .

hi honey .

hi dad .

hello ? sultenfuss parlor .

i 'll be back in 137 hours .

what does that mean ?

honey i know it 's fun to think about these things but ... .

okay , we need wallpaper paste . hey cece !

her favorite poet .

it 's just a question , it 's not about anybody .

dad , when a boy likes you , does he pretend that he does n't like you ? and if he pretends that he does n't like you how can you tell that he likes you ?

honey that 's very mature , i 'm proud of you vada .

well you know what i mean .

visualize a spare ?

okay thanks , atta girl .

okay , no problem .

well not far , just down the hall . plus grammoo 's room 's a lot bigger , and you get a view of the whole neighborhood .

do what ?

i got a card from your uncle phil in los angeles today , said he went body surfing .

i 'm sorry i could n't come pick you up honey .

well if there was an article about it i 'm sure she did . she was always reading .

oh , shell , that 's ridiculous , where are my needle nosed pliers ?

i do n't know if i want to .

then i 'll throw up a little bit .

ummmmm , look , i ... i ...

i thought that ... umm ... maybe you 'd be curious about how i turned out .

it 's good to see maggie again ... and you .

would you like ... eh ... to have these movies ?

she 's beautiful .

hillary mitchell ? how 's she ?

we have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and i chose my mother . she was born in los angeles and since my uncle phil moved out here i came in to visit him and then i looked at her high school yearbook and ... and i called a few people and one guy said that she went to ucla , another guy said that i should call hillary mitchell so ... .

you are ?

i 'm glad you 're here .

bye . she looks a little like me when i was a little girl .

i 'd like to , thanks .

ehh ... i do n't know i mean ... .

i do n't know . and i do n't care , kevin 's a jerk and i do n't like him anymore . he 's all yours !

he likes you .

oh god , he 's coming over here , act natural , totally natural .

you should be here when they bring in a body that 's been dead for a couple of days , and they have n't found it yet , 'cause it was in an apartment , and no-one came to visit , or floating in a river , and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green , you know , like watery pea soup ? the arms and legs deteriorate first , the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs . anyway , this is why i 'm seriously considering cremation . judy ? ?

it 's just a corpse .

come on in !

vada , he was giving you an easy out so you would n't have to write about your mother .

it 's okay with me , hi kevin .

are you jeffrey pommeroy ?

you know i 've been re-reading virginia woolf , i think she 'd be a natural for you , she led a fascinating life .

great , i have so much to say , i hardly know where to start .

i never met my mother .

mom !

make that sixty and i 'm docking your allowance for two weeks .

you 're over reacting !

you 're grounded 'till you 're fifty !

give it back nicholas !

i would n't say it was terrible ... it was ... kind of ...

some sacrifices are worth it .

maybe not ... but maybe it does . if no one told me about this , i mean ... maybe they 're trying to hide something .

it 's not his fault !

marriage can really complicate things . so , are n't you gon na say anything about my earrings ?

big deal .

here 's judy garland !

montgomery clift , wait 'till i tell shelly .

jerk ! you idiot ! ! !

leave me alone ! !

it 's dangerous ! !

owh ...

uh oh ...

just give it to me ! !

come and get it .

maybe it 'll fit my pinkie .

ehh ... okay ... but be careful , it has a lot of sentimental value .

let me see if it changes colors on me .

does it work ?

you are weird . let 's just go .

just call us the & quot ; dead end kids & quot ; .

this 'll be great in my report , my mother was suspended for smoking .

care for a smoke ?

what if you do n't wan na be found ?

change my name .

i 'd never do that .

what difference does it make ?

just remember the needle in the haystack .

getting off please .

i did n't ask for the money , phil just gave it to me .

he said it was a gift .

for the mini-bike fund .

what 's that ?

muh ? ?

i do n't think the color of the interior is ... .

okay , that does it , that does it , the strudel does it , first it 's brakes then ... . i mean i am not gon na let some podiatrist with a jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and ... .

doctor helburn , what a surprise . in the last couple of days we 've changed your oil , realigned your brakes , balanced and rotated your tires , aligned your front end , and flushed out your entire cooling system , i really did n't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles .

okay .

how 's this for a solution . we 'll take a drive over to his place , you can introduce yourself ... .

yes , it does .

committed .

she lives here too ?

i do n't want anything you do n't wan na give me .

you know where the fire extinguisher is .

we may go out for coffee after the meeting so do n't expect us before midnight .

oh ... what 's that ?

phil for god sake .

sounds like you 're very organized .

come on ... i 'll show you where you 're gon na stay .

who knew that when i started working in the finest foreign car shop in la , i would also find the light of my life .

bye niece , vada .

she 'll be all right baby .

well just do n't shave your legs ... he 'll never let you visit us again if i send you home hairless and full of holes .

lizt was my parents ' favorite , they were hungarian .

oh , well , i do n't wear a lot of jewelry .

well let 's just say you 're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia .

ahh , dr. helburn , why do n't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock , that 's when we open , we 'll get you started .

i 'm a pediatric cardiologist .

i was commenting on your hair .

but dad 'll never go for it .

it would be fantastic .

but what about you and the baby ? you need me .

how would you like to go visit your uncle phil in los angeles ... next week during your spring vacation , you could do research on your mom .

well , it must mean something . she was obviously very sentimental .

mmmmmm . root beer float that sounds good .

why do they call them training bra 's ? it 's not like learning to ride a bike .

no it does n't but ... i ... i wish it did .

he 'll remember my mother for sure . stanley it was a big class vada and ... but ... well of course he 'll remember , who could forget maggie ?

oh great ! !

i do n't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach . you know vada you have to watch what you eat here , i remember one time i went to a carnival with my cousins david and frank , and they both ate hot dogs , and the next day they came down with nephritis .

i like my name .

hi .

hey vada , guess what we got ?

we 're not gon na bet , we 're just gon na watch .

i stopped that !

pacifist !

sorry .

but , what if you 're afraid to ride horses ?

never mind .

that was grammoo 's . it 's a phrenology chart , they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not . come here , i 'll diagnose your head .

no .

uh huh .

yeah he got away . come on let 's go .

it 's not a real school , it 's a writing class , i wan na be a writer .

she 's crazy , she wants to go to school over the summer .

hi mr. bixler !

i knew he would n't come .

stay , huh ?

long trip . pretty nice of you to come .

... trouser width , this is all classic . which means safe , something i 'd wear .

i 'll think about it . i 'm okay .

to belong to someone .

i 'm taking my next book to viking .

tell him you love him . with all your heart .

two words .

that was thursday .

ben gay .

i wish .

i am breaking her heart in the short run , but doing her a gigantic favor ! she would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus !

sure .

you 've been working on this , huh ?

you like her .

what i mean , when i say annoyingly perfect , is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection . it is vulnerable and endearing . and that is annoying as shit .

i can see why .

same difference . if you love someone , it 's your duty to save them from themselves .

he says , `` swear . when we 're both 28 , if we 've never been married ... we marry each other ! ''

i 've lost interest .

he 's still in love with you .

the wandering sportswriter .

... i do n't send you men , anymore . you do n't know what to do with them .

needs salt .

is it sad to be an editor , and bask only in reflected insincerity ?

have you ever heard of . irony ?

... that this is all my fault ?

do n't you see ...

what with the psychosis and all , yeah .

who ? the jerk who 's running your life ?

look at all this beautiful food , so lovingly prepared ...

we settled this . and i reneged . that was n't fair .

probably am . forget i brought it up .

about michael 's job .

no , this happened to me once , almost , it was excruciating !

ju ...

he has you on a pedestal . and me in his arms .

i 've missed a step .

no .

i 'm not joking . i had to face up to all my competitive drives , and believe me , i 've got 'em .

... except one .

do you get hysterical in small confined spa ...

but nothing ever could , ever did , give me a moment 's pause about this marriage ...

so it 's sweet of you to be protective ...

after two weeks of cataloguing all his faults , i made a command decision that changed my life .

but he sure can kiss .

i 'm excited sports illustrated gave him this kind of shot , he 's only there a ye ...

what ? because i 'm a little understand ...

uh . how about promoting a bridesmaid ? someone you know for at least forty-five minutes .

see . dry . it 's in the delivery .

well , we 're ...

ex-cuse me ?

oh , she 's slipped out , the little monkey . prob'ly with michael , doin ' the nasty .

it 's jules , you guys have n't had a call from , say , kimberly , have you ?

... well , maybe it works on fingers , too .

well , you 're a little early ...

i thought michael was picking me up .

and you think he 's kept this to himself .

i think he 's been fired .

it 's a fax from sports illustrated from ben isaacson , michael 's boss .

they both have some growing up to do . but they 're good people , they 're starting with love . they 've got time .

... me , yeah . and she likes tommy lasorda . case closed .

course , if it 's later rather than sooner , i 'd hate to be you at six o'clock . you 've got a lot of explaining to ...

you ca n't believe you 've lost her ! sooner or later , you 'll find her , and you 'll look in each other 's eyes , and you 'll see all that love ...

almost three .

... wrote it , yeah . i 'm the bad guy .

what 's up ?

you never want to do that , see , that 's always a ... costly turnover . as they say in the sport biz .

she admits it 's her fault .

well . how come she did n't ...

this is her family and her fault .

i had the craziest dream last night ? walter and kimmy had asked your boss to ...

i just want to be alone . is that okay ?

the fax is from ben , too . man , it 's my wedding , and my boss ca n't leave me alone ...

you 're right . easy come , easy go .

it 's just ... up there ... right in front of walter 's ... y'know , computer . if memory serves .

me , too . i 'm getting married tomorrow .

we danced to it . just like this .

where did we first hear th ...

you 've been the man in mine .

you 've sort of been ... y'know , the woman in my life .

well , you 've got the rest of your lives .

big weddings are so strange .

michael ! !

wow and wow . you have a date , after this ?

it 's weird being the groom . all these things kimmy has to take care of ...

you 're not eating .

still . all 's fair in love and w ...

i guess you 're right . that would be deceitful ... manipulative ... controlling ... emascula ...

every day . she makes the bed .

no matter how many times i leave the toilet seat up , she forgets and puts it down .

i just admire your maturity , that 's all . i mean , there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring . day after day , year after year ...

i need you .

michael , it 's wednesday night , you ca n't possibly be getting married on su ...

yeh , well my old machine kept eating messages . i tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement , but finally ...

what is that sup ...

well , forgive me for screwing up your plans !

all of a sudden , i 'm supposed to drop out of school , forget my family , forget my career , forget all the plans i had for my life ...

it would only be , maybe , six months ? or three or four ? it would mean so much to him ...

i travel every week . college ball , motor sports , training camps ...

you 're much more his type .

maybe it 's happy there .

reverend dyer , this is kimberly 's somewhat butch maid of honor ...

i remember when i just saw you . skinny winnifred . jesus , you were skinny .

right here .

is there food ?

yes . i 'm cutting a record .

oh just about everything , i guess . those doctors started on an overhaul and do n't want to quit . they keep taking things out . she 's going to come home an egg shell . tough , though.. she 's tough .

i said , i 've been real tired .

you 'll have to speak up .

oh , honey , i did n't mean to scare you .

your job , huh .

how is that ?

haven ? hell , ' we 've been playing poker together since we were fourteen .

well , you did and she 's fine . thanks .

well -- maybe . let 's see what happens here .

i 'll be damned . boy , if you could get ryan to say something about hal phillip walker , would n't that be something ?

oh yea -- there has never been a better time for something new .

no , we never did that

hal ? well , hal and i have been friends for a long time .

sure thing .

well , honey , i sure hope it comes your way then .

you serious ?

if you 're serious . being serious is real important .

you think i should take lessons ?

you sure do it loud .

you bet .

i see .

hi , i 'm sueleen gay .

yes , i would .

yes , i did . that 's why tim studied it . because it was bruce lee 's fighting style .

tim studied several styles , but his favorite was jeet kune do .

the style of fighting that tim studied did n't believe in belts .

what was the color of tim 's belt ?

well , back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad . and we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors . so , you kids out there , keep the faith . cause mickey and mallory will be comin ' to your town real soon .

well , now me and mickey are gon na take it easy . just enjoy each other 's company , stop and smell the roses , notice the color purple , stuff like that .

what did you think then ?

looked like an interview to me .

mickey !

by all means , knock yourself out .

you got something you want to do ?

grace . i 'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother tim , if you feel up to it .

using the same doctors is not common practice .

well , since that time , they 've killed one person during their trail . and since their incarceration , they 've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates .

the prison board made the decision . a board of which i belong . we 're the who . the why is simple . mickey and mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor 's care , where hopefully they 'll receive the help they need .

why are mickey and mallory being moved to an asylum ? and who made the decision ?

mickey 's better half herself . mallory knox . this little lady drowned her father in a fish tank .

susanville , soledade .

who is n't ?

yes , sir .

what ?

she was born without a tongue .

just save your breath , wayne . we hate you . if anybody in the fuckin ' world deserves to die , it 's you .

no . not really .

we ai n't got all fuckin ' day !

... 'winner of the golden globe and the edward r. murrow award among others . ' tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer , his firm , his address , and phone number . tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines . you getting the idea ?

'every week by forty million people . i am a respected journalist . ' have you won any awards ?

on average forty million .

that 's what i thought . you tell them that . when we go down those stairs , i want you to scream what you just told me . 'my name is wayne gayle ! i am the star of american maniacs watched every week by ' -- how many people ?

let me have the keys .

let me check on scott . he 's hurt bad .

donut , get your camera . see if it 's broke .

now , i 'm no comedian , but it 's pretty funny . it 's a little johnny joke . now in the joke , little johnny ca n't talk . and little johnny 's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date .

everybody thought i 'd gone crazy . the cops , my mom , everybody . but you see , they all missed the point of the story . i was n't crazy . but when i was holding the shotgun , it all became clear . i realized for the first time my one true calling in life . i 'm a natural born killer .

it 's not that easy , wayne . donuts and a smoke only get you so far . you 're gon na have to do your job .

then was it worth it ?

do you miss mallory ?

what ? oh , aaahhh , what you did for fun for starters .

sorry about that .

not to anybody . she sings .

have you talked to mallory about this ?

yes . yours got the larger nielson share .

whose ratings were higher ?

i do n't give a damn if a million united states marines , all whistling the halls of montezuma , are gon na come marchin ' down this alley any second . there ai n't not fuckin ' way in hell i 'm leaving you . and that 's that !

they had us tied down during one of their house raids , you 've seen the headlines , and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gon na kill us .

mickey and mallory have that edge .

-- -and a snake-eye glare , arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence ferigno had .

capt ' n !

scotty ?

so you 're giving a man who butchers whole families , little babies included , my chocolate cream filled ?

roger , do you understand what the word 'no ' means ? it 's important we establish a rapport . something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who has n't had a donut in a year .

i 'm as serious about that as i am about going back to the donut store , and dipping that stupid mexican 's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled . gim me that other box .

i hear ya . play .

i assigned you bingham and washington to go along .

yeah . bus is all gassed up and ready to roll .

what the hell happened to you ?

well , mickey and mallory ca n't be together . so , we 'll put you on one of our prison busses and you 'll take mallory first , then you 'll come back for mickey .

thanks .

so unruly julie 's comin ' with me and planning the interview . you two go down to the editing bay , take the old footage and the new footage , put it together , and see what we got . get it into shape so when we finish the interview , we can just stick it in .

never is a very long time , wayne . a word only the weak use . i 'm not a sore loser . even if i do n't have a leg to stand on , i 'm going to get up and fight this world until i 'm on top again .

but you 'll never be whole again .

by taking away our legs . now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you 'll find in this gym . probably the whole city . they gave us the fighting spirit . before this happened i was content . now i 'm pissed off . now i 'm half a man and i 've got to work like the devil to get whole again .

why ?

but you see , that 's okay , wayne .

could we go with you and film it ?

i 'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a coke .

i did n't mean they were assholes . i mean if they 're leaving , get 'em outta here .

i 'll cut it in half . four guys , but that 's it .

okay . i 'll take two guys off .

well , let me let you in on one more fact you obviously do n't know . if i were to take my men away , mickey knox would snap your neck like a twig .

since he and his wife have been in custody , they 've killed -- -

by all means .

how 's everything coming , mr. gayle ?

no thanks .

what d'you say , duff ?

you gon na buy me a beer , frankie ?

all right , you get out of here , man !

that 'll be thirty-eight cents .

goddamnit , nigger - you must think you 're white ! who d'you think you are - king of harlem ?

then do like i said . men - this boy here 's got something to tell you-all . well , how about it ?

what d'you think ?

you a union man ?

'you duff anderson ?

yeah .

so it was n't funny , huh ? well , i thought it was . what d'you say , barney ? was n't it funny ? !

i do n't know .

people seen him 'round .

i ai n't so sure of that . if i was , maybe i 'd feel different .

well , she never gave me none . look , you better find him a place pretty quick .

thanks .

name 's duff .

well , i guess that 's all till tomorrow .

i do n't know . forty-eight , i guess .

well , he worked around .

would you like me to say anything tomorrow ?

oh yeah ?

hard to get up in the morning , huh ?

you don ' know nothin ' 'bout it , baby . nothin ' ! and do n't kid yourself - you did your bit .

i do n't think that 'll happen .

jesus , baby , you 're so full of talk ! well , you ai n't never really been a nigger , have you - livin ' like that in your father 's house ! so just shut your mouth .

just of getting hurt . they ca n't touch me inside .

you were plenty scared that night in the car .

i ca n't stand to see you like that . i know you ca n't help it .

do n't do that !

day work .

sure , baby . 'fact , i do n't ever have to work no more . when that baby comes , i can just stay home and send you back to school . how about that ?

water pump 's busted . i do n't know if it 's worth fixin ' , but i need that car .

hi .

hell , baby - i met this beautiful chick and she 's just dyin ' for me , okay ?

yeah .

what about your boy ?

ai n't that something ? ! that 's just fine , baby .

well , i have n't come around .

my kids want me to teach them .

well , if you do n't know i ca n't tell you .

you still did n't answer my question .

duff - you know those women you used to know --

yeah , that 's so .

that 's all right with me . always liked kids .

no . but a small one .

yeah . would n't be no picnic for you . i ai n't exactly housebroken .

your boy .

i thought you was n't comin ' .

that 's right .

i 'm just going in to do my shopping .

no , i ai n't married . well , good-bye .

are you married ?

i did n't know you had one .

look , duff - if you 're free , i 'm not working tomorrow .

that 's the way he is .

ai n't your fault .

all right , so i 'm primitive . so what d'you want with me ?

you have some very primitive ideas , do n't you ?

well , either we 're gon na hit the hay or get married . now you do n't want to hit the hay , and i don ' want to get married .

you almost got into trouble back there .

well , i do n't get on so well most places .

damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week .

well , they seem just like everyone else .

no thanks .

no .

you know , baby , i ca n't figure you out .

what d'you expect ?

that 's pretty good for a preacher 's daughter .

look , i do n't know what you been told 'bout section gangs , but how 'bout seein ' me sometime ?

that 's right .

my father 's the preacher .

have n't seen you around , have i ?

thank you , ma'am . that 's fine .

why do n't you relax , frankie ?

'bye , jocko .

yeah . that 's right , jocko . those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them .

see you , duff .

could n't get the words out before .

take it easy , pop .

well , matter of fact , i done a lot of bangin ' 'round .

she do n't look no worse to me .

want me to hold the light for you ?

hell , i 'm just like him .

going back , huh ?

well , that figures . kind of fits in with everything else , do n't it !

and since we 're talking , my wife and i do n't want you hanging around our daughter .

i see . well , i guess we do n't have much to say to each other .

all right , son .

how are you ?

ol ' doris sure goin ' to miss you .

'musta knocked her up .

well , if it ai n't duff !

why do n't you guys buy your own ?

well , i got married to one of them .

i understand .

anything you say , baby .

better now . where 'you at ?

got a thick feelin ' here .

your mother used to lay for her boss , boy . did you know that ?

nothin ' . she 's all right . would n't have made it without her . christ - have n't worked in eight months . right now , i 'm waitin ' for some insurance money . and man , when i get it , i got plans to make me some more . let 's get out ' a here . this place gives me the willies . you got some money ?

hi .

baby - want you to meet duff .

i want my wife . i told you and told you . now i 'm gettin ' tired of this shit --

bathroom . but he 's nowhere near it .

we got any shots ?

that 's not the play . omar 'll get a shot off . i can still talk to him , nate , i just need time .

beck 's just put us on standby for crisis entry .

pity . then you 'll both have to die .

do n't play with me .

take this off .

no . i only needed the code from you .

oh my god , i 'm terribly sorry . did i hurt you ?

what about her ?

it 's nothing . c'mon ... we 've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here .

she was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware .

what the hell is that ?

i 'm getting used to it . where are we ?

can you get us into straylight ?

the elders , mon ...

how 's the villa 's security ?

he 's a vat grown ninja , the royal family 's bodyguard . watch out for him , he 's no joke .

an artificial intelligence . a computer system that 's developed the capacity for sentient thought . they 're dangerous and totally unpredictable .

this ai n't bangkok , chief .

you 've got your orders .

as long as you cooperate . i want it now , armitage .

then once she 's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe ?

you see the couple up in the balcony ?

really ? do i get to know where i 'm going ? it makes packing so much easier .

no , but it traced me .

what 's he doing to my gear ?

you ran without us .

right . best cowboy that ever punched deck . the old man taught me most of what i know .

we 'll match your rate just prior to your ... accident . one half in advance .

what would you say if i told you we could correct your neural damage ?

if someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe . i 'm assembling a team of specialists , mr. case . we need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur .

the corporate plundering of yeshoto industries ... at first these seemed like unrelated incidents , but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise .

patience , mr. case . only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment .

no girl ? only biz , my dear artiste ?

i saw your girl yesterday .

fine , ratz . thanks .

ah , herr case . and how is the artiste tonight ?

dixie , you know how a rom construct works ?

jesus christ , kid . nobody 's ever cracked sukura .

fine , dixie . fine .

case ... yeah , miami joeboy , quick study . how you doing , kid ?

jah guides us .

we 're dead men if we go back there , maelcom . they 'll hunt us down .

can you walk ?

we 're doing fine . take the next right .

help me send this wintermute motherfucker straight down into it .

all things possible in babylon .

maelcom ... do you think there 's a hell for computers ?

steppin ' razor a warrior . but this man ... ... this man stone crazy . surely , the mute is a false prophet . our paths uncertain .

what about the route to the core ?

i 'm getting too old for this shit . one oh four and counting .

then i 'll fry taking this son of a bitch out . i 'm making the run , dixie .

how 's the ice ?

how long , dixie ?

take a look . son of a bitch wo n't feel a thing until it 's too late .

you can make your move when it comes after me .

getting fried ai n't going to get it any smarter . what we got here is one mad dog schizo a.i.. armitage is right about one thing , bro . if we do n't shut this mother down soon , nothing will be safe from it .

so it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding . that means wintermute hired us to fry itself . it does n't make sense .

what ?

what about the a.i. , dix ? sense/net has n't even been able to trace it .

never heard of him .

you 're dixie mccoy 's construct . that makes you something special .

i ca n't feel nothing because i am nothing . just playback . a ghost in the machine .

no ! ... no ...

wait ... you hear that ?

3jane 's the only person beside tessier that knows the code .

you , i presume are mr. armitage . and this is ...

this time it 's different . someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens . five grams of liquid ketamine . it was supposed to be jo jo 's score .

no , it 's you that is full of shit . and blood . and bones . a typically imperfect organic being . you 've been hopelessly predictable all along , but you 're going to have to do better than that now .

i think you 're full of shit .

you set me up from the beginning . it was you that got julius killed .

there 's no call for violence . i 've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson . you use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption . you see , you 've been avoiding me , case .

hold on .

you 're out of time , man .

laser fail-safe . you ca n't get the code wrong ... it slags you . i ca n't let you try it .

then you and maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen .

he projects with neural implants .

something exotic i hope .

okay fine . let 's get this over with .

the first fun 's bound to be rough . it that read out fluctuates more than ten points ... just pull this out . but if the eeg flatlines , do n't touch anything .

what is it with you ? why is it so important ? it 's a buzz , right ? like getting high .

you 're not ready yet . they said two days .

go ahead ...

what the fuck ... are you serious ?

not anymore . you got a new pancreas . armitage 's got you kinked so you ca n't get stoned .

that 's not going to help .

you 've been calling her name .

since armitage sold them a program on it . put them years ahead of the competition .

since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the japanese ?

... a friend of mine 's gon na get herself killed . i need my clip .

what are you talking about ?

how are you at riddles , peter ?

surviving , darling . it 's my specialty . only this time i 'm doing it my style . i 've beaten him , you know .

oh . i forgot .

hey , where 's your sweatshirt ?

have you ever wanted to go to the court ?

that 's the old drive-in . they call it `` the court '' . now it 's just a continuous party for guy 's group .

what 's that ?

nasa . plus we have these really fun pizza study groups , and we go to-these all county meets . and , i mean , not that you need it , and without sounding too much like the godfather , i think we could offer you a certain amount of protection '' , if you know what i mean . we all kind of stick together and watch out for each other .

petty good .

sure . no problem .

professor of medieval literature . novelist . weekend flautist .

oh i know .

i 'm josie . aldys is an interesting name .

you should go out every now and then , gus ; with some new ties the girls would be all over you .

oh give it up , gus . i 'm just making conversation .

it 's great ! they 're behind you . they feel like they know you .

you need my help ?

jos , please try and have some fun here , okay ? how many of us get to go back to high school ? you 're gon na have a blast !

and we 're going to have to do something about your hair .

'nita , this is about reporting , not accessorizing .

cuuuute !

what 'd you feel when you kissed him ?

that is lingerie .

mama mia . just because you were a nerd once does n't mean it 's going to happen again . that 's why you have me for fashion consultation .

at the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool .

and gus - when you picked up knitting , who showed you how to hold the needles ?

okay , just so i 'm clear here -- neither of you think i can do this .

jos - maybe you should turn it down .

my own undercover feature - `` written by josie geller '' .

look . you 're way under 30 , you 're cute , some guys find white carter 's underwear sexy if you talk to his nose , you do n't even notice the eye .

i 'm concentrating on my career right now .

forget it .

and what is your policy ? that if you 're not getting any , no one can ?

well , that does n't mean it was going to happen for sure .

roger in op/ed .

i 'm not doing this until i speak with gus .

we used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants -- '' is that why they never give you a second bag of nuts ? ''

wings ?

do n't tell me ... you 're medieval barbie .

by guy ?

transitioned ?

your story was rigfort 's baby . we were scooped ! we 've got nothing . zippo . you totally and completely screwed both of us .

he 's my teacher !

you 're crazy . i ca n't -- i can't-no . no .

depend on it . no s. your subject is plural .

they hid my car --

do you even know these kids ?

well , how would you define to parties '' ? because we ordered a deli platter at this one denominator drill session --

have you been there ?

no , i am appalled that i have a reporter in there , undercover , for almost three weeks now- i had to read about this in the tribune .

well , the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf --

it 's an expose on cafeteria food .

do n't worry , i 'll straighten all this out .

you know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters ?

yeah -- the blind foster home mother . it was good . i got cahoon on it .

hey gus -- did you see the story idea i left on your desk ?

five -- six --

oh .

my sword .

yes . i 'll go . yes .

you know what , though ? i feel like i 'm really ready to do it . to have sex for the first time .

yes . exactly . major rufus .

rufus ?

she 's sixteen years old , rob . that 's totally and completely illegal .

really ? rob- , that girl is sixteen .

with the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old ! plus , i 'm popular ... you want to be popular ... i can recognize a cry for help when i see one .

you 're twenty-three years old !

this is it jos ! this is my ninth inning ! the game is n't over -- i just thought it was ! i get on the southglen baseball team , the right scout sees me -- i 'm into the minors- it 's game time !

look , do n't you wan na show them - gus , billy prince , yourself -- that you 're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore ? that you can go in there , be friends with them , and get your story ?

come on ! it 's not that hard . all you need is one person . once the right person thinks you 're cool , you 're in . everyone else will be too scared to question it .

i ca n't do this .

it was a long time ago -

do you remember high school ?

i 'll give you my buick le sabre .

this -- this is a luau that sells packing material !

better person than i .

rob , take the money , okay ? it 's no big deal .

she just needs a new windshield wiper .

please . please do n't walk away .

you set me up . for a story . you know what 's crazy ? i was actually considering waiting for you .

it 's weird because `` prom '' is actually from the word `` promenade '' . and you ca n't really promenade alone , can you ?

told him -- if i 'm wrong about this girl , you can take away my teaching certificate !

our penguin , right ?

but humpty dumpty was alone .

thanks . they were n't related to humpty dumpty , were they ? tweedle dum and tweedle dee ?

actually , it 's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me .

thanks . wow . that 's -- really nice to hear .

so what are you thinking for college ?

oh i do n't think so .

but i think she wanted to be happy , that 's why she wrote . i mean , she was still writing about love , right ?

hi , everyone . i don t think we 've met . i 'm sam coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me sam .

who are you guys ?

it 's really hard to do . some kids try for all of-high school and never make it .

nah uh .

aloha ! welcome !

good . gibby gave me champagne .

yeah . definitely .

well , a ball player .

hi . i 'm tracy and i 'm sixteen and i 'm a gymnast and i do n't have a boyfriend ...

he < u > has < /u > to know ...

< i > now in the box , we 'll wait and hide until his curiosity entices him to look inside ... < /i >

< i > i 've got something , listen now , this one is real good , you 'll see . we 'll send a present to his door upon there 'll be a note to read. < /i >

< i > i wish my cohorts were n't so dumb. < /i >

by name .

he 's conducting experiments of his own .

when he left , he took a lot of equipment with him .

then we 'll both starve ... an old man like me , who hardly has strength as it is -- me , without whom ... me , your own father ...

there 's nothing more suspicious than worm 's wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell .

that 's not true . it 's a beautiful home , wonderfully comfortable ... i 'm indebted to you for everything ... it 's just ...

but i guess my best just is n't good enough .

if you went away , what would become of me ?

you 're mine , you know . i made you .

yes .

for this .

yes .

specifically .

do n't tell me it 's not the gas !

no . upstairs .

who 's lisa ?

do n't be a smart ass .

dad 's fixin ' something again . hit the deck !

it 's getting there .

i do n't know ! i just know he needs help and we do n't know how to give it to him .

are you nuts or something ? what the hell is that going to do ?

do n't tell me it 's not the gas ! your mother thought she smelled gas .

he 'll die with me !

wan na join your little friend ?

you 're fucked in the head .

are you nuts or something ?

oh jesus . i 'm gon na be sick .

only the wet ones .

who told you to choke up that way ?

it was okay .

you hit that ball pretty good , walsh .

you two got a thing going , or what ?

get outa here .

could be all night . guy gets his rocks off like this . hangs out in queer s & m joints downtown . likes prettyboys like you .

how much longer you figure he 'll keep us out here ?

hi .

fred krueger . he 's been trying to get hold of me , to use me . he needs me to get out of his world into ours ... he 's gon na take me again .

who ? who 's doing this to you ?

jesse , god - what happened ?

i 'm afraid to go to sleep , i 'm afraid to stay awake - i 'm ruining your party . they 're gon na put me away for sure .

what are you gon na do ? how are you gon na help ? i 'm losing my mind . i do n't want to have you watch me fall apart .

you 're not being fair to me . i 'm worried about you and i want to help you get through this thing .

i think i better go . i 'm just not into it tonight . i 'm sorry .

you should eat something - you 'll feel better .

whoa !

yeah ?

about not finding any bogey men ?

i do n't know . concentrate or some- thing .

c'mon , cut it out .

here .

what is this place ?

yeah , i know ... synapses neurong ...

what 's all this .

i know .

you okay ?

look at this car . are you kidding ?

your timing was perfect - i was getting the third degree in there .

no . i 'm okay .

okay , i guess .

eggs ?

huh ?

all of them .

we 're gon na stay out of your way tomorrow night .

okay ... thanks .

did she always have nightmares ?

please mom ? i just do n't want to be alone .

i thought i 'd wait for you .

i 've been good . when do i get cigarette priveleges back ?

how 's your hand ?

if you get caught , i never saw you . deal ?

jennifer --

if simms catches you in here after lights out , she 'll chew my ass ragged .

girl , what are you doing ?

last time , it was me against him . i was n't strong enough ... alone .

i know who 's trying to kill you .

yes . i 'm going to see her tonight .

to old friends .

to old friends . and your new dreams .

the city that never sleeps . so what will you do now ?

i think new york was just what i needed . so many people . i never feel alone .

kristen , can you pull us out ?

you never lose a gift like that . you just forget how to use it . how about it ? will you try ?

that was different .

we 're not always as good at things as we 'd like .

i was on the team at school . i was never very good , though .

sure .

he 's real .

when i was still a kid . my folks got divorced . after a while , i thought i 'd imagined the whole thing . i guess i did n't .

but ... it 's just a house i 've dreamed about . i dream about it all the time . thank you for what you did last night .

stay out of my face or i 'll go straight to max .

oh yeah ? well , if you 're ever in the mood for a history lesson , i 'm your teacher , understand ?

what are these , beauty marks ?

i do n't know ...

restless . very restless .

i just wanted to be here for the kids . how are they ?

puttin ' in soem late hours , i see . if you 're trying for o.t. , you 're in the wrong place .

she 's been waiting outside your office since breakfast .

max , where 's kristen ?

i 'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow . the patient 's rooms are down here .

but i could n't go until i told you how sorry i am for all the things i 've done .

crossed over ?

nancy ...

it 's over . it 's over .

it 's been a long time .

the question is , what happened to freddy 's body ?

do n't you think i know that ? i do n't have any choice .

anything ?

take it slowly . remember , this is a dream . anything is possible .

take us there , kristen .

okay , we 're going to try a little group hypnosis .

remember -- open mind .

for what ?

then maybe you 're ready .

i 'm sorry , nancy . the answer is no .

dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with . you have no business taking it yourself .

the nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems .

that 's what i know .

what if i told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams ?

i 'm serious .

my father an i ... well , the family just seemed to fall apart .

sorry .

you 're late .

only if you call me neil . what was that nursery rhyme all about ?

make sure to check in with max , he 'll give you the 25 cent tour .

i 've had some experience with pattern nightmares .

i would n't be so sure they have n't .

ever work with vets ? these kids act like they 've got d.s.s . -- delayed stress syndrome . if i did n't know better , i 'd swear they 'd seen heavy combat .

who is he ?

the by-product of guilt . psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality .

and what are they ?

somebody else is out here .

we 've got work to do .

the bastard son of a hundred maniacs . some say he was murdered , though no body was ever found .

this wing 's been closed for years . what was this place ?

only one thing can save the children . the unquiet spirit must be laid to rest . it is an abomination to god and man .

i 'll go straight to carver if i have to . he 'll either back me up or accept my resignation .

elizabeth , i 'm prescribing hypnocyl . it 's a dream suppressant .

okay , group 's in session . straight talk only in this room .

frankly , i do n't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro .

what did you think ?

where ... here ?

uh , fourteen .

accident my ass . i thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here .

and you . i 'll wait till you 've gone before i tell him you 're a vegetarian .

lovely to meet you .

i wonder if you could tell me where the ... ?

now you 're lying .

i 'm sorry ? you think you deserve the brownie ?

and then i ... right .

'tomorrow will be soon enough . '

i said i 'm not listening -- and i think , looking at something that firm , you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse ' would be well-advised to keep quiet .

god , that 's an enormous arse .

we have to . i 've got to be in new york on thursday .

oh splendid . well done . how 's the pay in movies ? i mean , last film you did , what did you get paid ?

no , do n't open it yet -- i 'll be embarrassed .

thank you . shall i ...

yes -- i 'm sorry -- i had to leave ... i did n't want to disturb you .

hello .

i only found out you were here yesterday .

now stop . stop . i beg you -- calm down . have a cup of tea .

i know , i know -- but ... just -- let 's stay calm ...

you do ?

that 's not true .

how are you doing ?

can i stay a bit longer ?

oh .

who was gilda ?

what ?

okay .

right .

you have a stunt bottom ?

big feet -- large shoes .

with a goat playing a violin .

gripping . it 's not jane austen , it 's not henry james , but it 's gripping .

my son 's name is johnny ?

well done you .

i 'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster .

no , that 's fine . it 's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major hollywood star . it was a thrill for me . how is he ?

come in .

i 'm sorry ... i do n't know what to say .

why ?

there are lots of reasons . do you want to come up ?

i 'm rash and i 'm stupid and what am i doing with you ?

no , you were brilliant

no , that 's fine . i love that you tried ... time was i 'd have done the same .

she left me .

so who left who ?

it 's a disease i 've got -- it 's a clinical thing . i 'm taking pills and having injections -- it wo n't last long .

what did you say ?

ahm ...

you abide by rules like that ?

i was .

that 's fine .

too complicated .

you know , i 'm not sure . i do n't think they 'd tried for kids before , as fate would have it .

well , i 've been on a diet since i was nineteen , which means basically i 've been hungry for a decade . i 've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me : and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment . meantime , it cost millions to get me looking like this ...

you 'll have to prove it . this is a great brownie and i 'm going to fight for it . state your claim .

okay .

okay .

but no , i 'm sure i can get out of it .

are you busy tonight ?

right . great . classic . classic .

oh hi . forget something ?

eighteen yards . that 's my house there .

okay . so what does 'just over the street ' mean -- give it to me in yards .

i also have a phone . i 'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again ... in the non-prostitute sense obviously .

yes , we could n't stop him . if you can find an unsigned copy , it 's worth an absolute fortune .

i have n't decided .

excuse me .

can i just say , i thought 'ghost ' was a wonderful film .

christ , what is going on in there ?

he 's bringing a girl ?

no !

c'est la vie ... we 're lucky in lots of ways , but ... surely it 's worth a brownie .

anna scott ?

oh no -- this is just getting worse . i am going to find myself , 30 years from now , still on this couch .

do n't even ask .

well , you know , anybody saying they want to go out with you is ... pretty great ... is n't it ...

that 's nice .

good move : when all is said and done , she 's nothing special . i saw her taking her pants off and i definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there .

what do you think ? good move ?

it is great , is n't it . see you tonight . hey , marty -- sexy cardy .

hun -- this is anna . anna -- this is honey -- she 's my baby sitter .

ahm ... bernie .

ah -- no . it 's fine .

how you doing ? i thought you guys all wore those penguin coats .

are you a fan of henry james ?

mr. thacker 's from 'horse and hound . '

'horse and hound . ' the name 's william whacker . i think she might be expecting me .

any bit in particular ?

ah ... yes , enormously .

i actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it 's been twenty-four hours , and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color ...

but it 's not for the shop . it 's for you .

i have to disturb you when you 're cooking the books , but there 's a delivery .

not classic , no .

no , well ... he was quite a long way away .

but ringo starr does n't look anything like topol .

absolutely . never trust a vegetarian .

let 's face facts . this was always a no-go situation . anna 's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods .

so i get the brownie ?

do you ever masturbate ?

no , sir .

how about miss flintstone ?

i 'm sorry , we do n't have anyone of that name here , sir .

ahm , look this is a very odd situation . i 'm a friend of anna scott 's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she 's staying with you ...

may i help you , sir ?

... ca n't let you through .

oh right . i mean , i am a friend -- i 'm not a lunatic but -- no , you basically ...

i 'm afraid i ca n't really let you through then , sir .

no . you ca n't bin these . they 're classics . i 'm not allowing this .

what 's going on ?

what he 's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the sudan .

i would n't go outside .

well , is n't this perhaps a good opportunity to ... slip her one ?

yes .

and she 's in your house .

maybe .

spike .

you 're welcome . did you find them ?

bollocks , bollocks , bollocks . have you seen my glasses ?

does 'flintstone ' mean anything to you ?

yeh , i wrote a couple down .

just incidentally -- why are you wearing that ?

hey .

well , there you go . on for a video fest tonight ? i 've got some absolute classic .

would n't want that ... okay -- just one more .

point taken .

well ... wait for it ... first there 's this one ...

this is important in comparison to , let 's say , whether they should cancel third world debt ?

how was she ?

i 'm sorry . which hospital ?

i have n't got a book down my trousers .

so ?

we 've got a security camera in this bit of the shop .

bad news .

no . mister harding , that is not true .

have you ever speculated , mister harding , that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements ?

yes , that is correct .

but you have no proof .

n-n-n-n-no , no , i du-du-du-did n't , i did n't !

billy , were you afraid of her , or of her love ?

would you like to start ?

m-m-m-ma'am ?

ma'am , i 'm as gentle as a puppy dog . why , i have n't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks ! hi ya , doc !

thank you , ma'am .

yeah , ya should 've come along with us , miss ratched , an ' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two .

mister mcmurphy , you are deliberately violating the rules ! ...

i 'm sorry , mister mcmurphy , but you must have a majority to change ward policy .

very well . what is it you 're proposing , mister mcmurphy ?

jesus christ , the man does n't want to talk , so get off his back an ' let 's get on to some new business .

yes . now was there anything else you wanted to discuss , mister mcmurphy ?

right ... i 've been givin ' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours , an ' i got a few things i wan na get off my chest , before we get back to harding 's problem .

yes , mister mcmurphy .

well , say . how 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose ?

yeah , some creep stole my cigarettes !

mister mcmurphy . patients are n't allowed in here .

good . i 'm sure we 'll be friends .

good . now if you 'll just go along with mister washington , he 'll see that you 're properly oriented .

please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know , do n't hesitate to ask us .

we do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients .

hold the fort down , will ya , fellas !

yes , miss ratched ?

yeah , kid ?

fuck miss ratched !

w-w-w-what is it , m-m-mac ?

that 's okay , kid ...

y-y-yes ! yes ! y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us !

well , put 'er there , billy boy , my name 's mcmurphy .

shoot ! no wonder you do n't care nothin ' 'bout showin ' your hand .

yeah , well , well , well . 'bout time the rest of the world got a gander at big chief bromden cuttin ' down the boulevard , stopping just long enough for virgins ... oh , man , i tell you , i tell you , you 'll have women trippin ' you and beating you to the floor ...

wait a minute ...

what ? where ?

sock it to 'em , kid !

hey , what 's that ?

charlie , ya ca n't ever let those goons outta ya sight ! understand !

yeah , mack , what is it ?

that 's nice . send me a post card .

ya owe me twenty-five bucks .

just warmin ' up .

giving up ?

with your own two hands ?

you boys seem to think you 've got a champ in there , huh ?

what are you doing ?

do n't you have any clubs ?

hear what ?

big king , too bad ...

miss ratched . given all the conditions of that sublime relationship , coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that i held to be sacred , mentally , physically and emotionally , the only thing that i can speculate on , at this late date , is how i will justify the very existence of my life , with or without my dear wife .

okay , martini . that 's okay . now you watch me .

i saw 'em ! i saw 'em .

what is it ?

yeah , it 's cold !

no . me ! me !

gim me the ball !

we 'll let you know .

no , mister mcmurphy , it 's just that we can not offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at pendleton .

yes , that may be so , but in making a careful study of your past record , along with your behavior since you arrived here , my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case .

doc , what can i tell ya ?

yes ... ah , do you know why you 're here ?

mcmurphy , doc . r.p . mcmurphy .

why , i 'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute .

hold it !

do n't get upset , mister mcmurphy ...

it 's just medication , mister mcmurphy , good for you . now down it goes ...

yeah , we 'll miss breakfast !

ten bucks .

up an ' at 'em , taber .

yeah , yeah , you 're a fucking phony , mcmurphy !

you think it 's funny , huh ?

how do ya know that ?

i 'm the next one .

no , 'fraid not ...

martini out !

shhhh . see ya around the ball park .

yeah , what 's up ?

scanlon ! hey , scanlon , wake up !

a dime .

you just come on with that three fifty and martini will take care of himself ... your dice , scanlon .

yeah , that 's a good idea , turkle . why do n't ya take rose on a little tour of our facilities ...

i tell ya , there 's an angel of mercy standing out there , turkle .

what you boys doin ' up at this ungodly time o ' the night ?

hey , how ya doin ' ?

he 's a patient , rose ...

there they are !

yes , i see it ! i see it !

why , my head would just squash like an eggplant , mcmurphy .

hit , you say ? well well well and with a king up , the boy wants a hit . whadaya know . so comin ' at you and too bad , a little lady for the lad and he 's over the wall and down the road , up the hill and dropped his load .

make yourself at home , mister mcmurphy ...

thank you .

yes , sir , i sure am gon na enjoy my stay here .

this way , mister mcmurphy .

hey , sam , bet ya two bucks ya lose .

tha 's your problem .

the lights were flashing on and off , mister turkle .

why , sure , ma'am ...

is everything all right ?

shhh , please , miss . keep it down ...

are they dangerous when they 're awake ?

what ?

look , she was n't a relative , okay ? i do n't know who she is .

you do n't understand . the man i 'm supposed to marry is on that plane .

i 'm sorry , but without a boarding pass we ca n't let you on the plane .

because .

why ?

no ... it 's just very important that i find him , okay ?

i 'm very sorry . perhaps you misunderstood ?

mr. bradley left about a half hour ago . he said his plans had changed unexpectedly . would you prefer an interior or exterior room ?

no , really . what 's she doing ?

let 's find a telephone .

it just happened . i did n't plan it . i was alone . and he was ... there . but now everything 's changed . i owe it to him to let him know . i need to tell him .

your hair ... is perfect .

-- separate , in the evening ... ''

there 's this poem by rilke , i do n't remember the whole thing , but it 's about that . about waiting for that person , and wondering if you 'll ever find them . and the last line of it goes , `` who knows ? perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us , yesterday --

dwayne pinsley . from high school . that 's how i knew you were here . when you called , from the airport .

dwayne ?

nothing you could say would change the way i feel .

there is one other thing you should know about me .

no .

ask her if she knows how i might reach him ? if she has a telephone number ?

larry , can i borrow your car keys ?

we 'll know .

yeah , but , what if this guy lived a billion , trillion years ago ? like , what if he was a cave man , and now he 's dead ?

wait . i have to write this down .

beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing . nobody 's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it . but , i do n't know . an awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks .

where are you going ?

i can hardly hear you . could you spell that ?

i 'm sure he 'll be sorry to hear that . who should i tell him called ?

who 's this ?

no , it is n't . i called off my wedding all because of you .

a `` little white lie '' ? a `` little white lie '' ?

and i ca n't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger , some phantom you 've never even met destroy it .

i ca n't believe you did that !

i do n't know what you 're talking about . who told you that ?

i 'd call that a yes . do i get a hint ?

in that case ... no ...

hi .

i 'm sorry .

you were saying ...

thank you , peter . thank you so much .

oh , thanks . well , have a good time .

just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs . nothing fancy .

and she 's a knock-out , too .

well , it looks like we both lucked out . i just met somebody myself . somebody my aunt introduced me to .

do you want me to do it ?

oh , and i forgot to tell you . he 's here with his mother .

uh , i 'd rather not say .

oh no , i do n't think that would be a good idea .

it 's in the south . i 've still got my rental car . i can get you there by morning ...

because . i know where he is .

so ?

look , peter , i do n't hate you . but what we had was an illusion . mutual wishful thinking . we both wanted to believe it for awhile , but it was all founded on a lie .

he 's a podiatrist . pain is your body 's way of telling you something is wrong . your toe is trying to tell you not to do it .

i know i 'm limping . i stubbed my toe .

how could you do this to me ?

so , what are we waiting for ?

so , you say you 've been to italy before ?

faith , this is my mother .

well , to -- new friends .

brunello di montalcino , '85 , please .

yes ?

wait .

i 'll look forward to it .

you 're damon bradley ?

larry , did you rent a car ?

he 's gone . he told me what happened . he just left for the airport .

i do n't know . i 've just been thinking ... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation . maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for .

oh .

so ...

what if he does n't like me ?

is damon bradley here ?

i 'm sure . and kate , thank you for coming . thank you for being such a good friend .

you sure you 'll be okay ?

the last dead end in a long series of dead ends that i am relieved to finally be leaving behind . may as well start packing , our cab 's gon na be here in an hour .

a little bad luck ?

why ?

but how could he know ? he only just met me .

faith --

right , right ... okay.. you do n't think he 's gon na think i 'm too aggressive ?

not if you do n't count the sixth grade .

sure you did .

because i 'm the one who 's single .

you 've travelled over six thousand miles and now you 're gon na play hard to get ?

what did you say to her ?

you know , when larry and i got married , i thought we were so lucky we found each other so early . people talk about spending their lives together , how many of them really get to ? but maybe i was wrong . maybe sooner or later everything wears out .

so , what exactly is larry 's side of the story , anyway ?

could n't we just have taken a train ?

only what ?

a phone message . only --

we 're not looking to arrest the man , faith , we 're trying to locate him .

a rich , possibly fat , slob .

what 'd you find ?

i do n't think he understood what you were saying . what 's the airport number ?

are you sure ?

live happily ever after .

would you stop saying that ? i need you to do me a really big favor .

i think he 's having an affair .

people have problems , insecurities , flaws -- and you have to learn to compromise , to overlook , to forgive . it 's not settling , faith , it 's life . real life .

but one day you wake up and realize you 've been had . of course life is n't like the movies . that 's why there are movies .

why do n't you ask him ?

no . he 's never asked me .

`` thrills '' ? that 's what you 're waiting for ? you know how long that lasts ? besides , how do you know ? have you ever been out with him ?

just that they came out of somebody 's experience is all .

so , what 's your point ?

but somebody wrote those songs .

i think if you 're honest with yourself , you 'll admit you 've had a chance at a number of amana appliances in your lifetime .

metaphorically , i still do n't have an amana freezer .

how about that guy at the bank ?

no . he smokes .

yeah . he 's around somewhere .

that 's exactly what you are .

i 'd love to .

oh , hello . i just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink , but --

giovanni , this is faith 's friend , peter .

she 's saying he 's a -- a -- porco .

and you are ? ...

she what ? !

he existed . he was some kid i knew from little league . he was a real jerk . you say he 's a friend of dwayne 's ?

damon bradley ? that 's why you 're here ?

and we did n't have to bring another present ?

uh , yeah . sure . honey , did you forget the guys are coming over tonight ?

oh , it 's you . it 's only peter .

that 's the guy you 've been waiting for all these years ?

she went out to check into skywriting . i ca n't believe you lied . is this a genetic thing , men will say anything just to get laid ?

where is she ?

she 's not here .

you know johnny when he gets mad .

i 'm gon na take her home first .

right now ?

that 's all . next witness !

you mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand , five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records ?

so do i , charley . for your sake .

after what we been hearing about your brother , i thought your throat 'd be kind of dry .

you got a real friend here , kid . do n't forget it .

gim me .

i make it twentysix twenty-three . you 're fifty short , skins .

okay i 'll tell him i could n't bring you in . ten to one they wo n't believe it , but go ahead , blow . jump out , quick , and keep going ... and god help you from here on in .

it was you , charley ... .

see ! you do n't understand !

i always had a bet down for you . you saw some money .

it was n't him ! it was you , charley . you and johnny . like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says , `` kid , this ai n't your night we 're going for the price on wilson . '' it ai n't my night . i 'd of taken wilson apart that night ! i was ready remember the early rounds throwing them combinations . so what happens this bum wilson he gets the title shot outdoors in the ballpark ! and what do i get a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to palookaville . it was you , charley . you was my brother . you should of looked out for me . instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money .

... eight-seven , eighty-eight . what 's it to you ?

i wish i did n't have to do this , terry .

four thirty-seven that is n't where gerry g ... ?

ex-tanker who 's walking on his heels ?

do n't say that !

well , then , you know cousin johnny is n't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped

listen , terry , these piers we handle through the locals you know what they 're worth to us ?

i do n't know i do n't know ! i tell you i ai n't made up my mind yet . that 's what i wanted to talk to you about .

absolutely nothing . you do nothing and you say nothing . you understand , do n't you , kid ?

a steady job and a few bucks extra , that 's all i wanted .

mmhmm .

nothing ever stops you from talking , charley .

thicker than water .

gee , charley , i 'm sure glad you stopped by for me . i needed to talk to you . what 's it they say about blood , it 's

come on , kid . i 'll buy you a drink .

he probably gave 'em an argument .

you hear that , terry ? terry , did you hear that ? you lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war . all you got ta do is walk .

what happened ? what happened ?

do n't turn away ! look at it ! you 're in this too do n't you see , do n't you see ? you 're in this too , father .

time and faith ... . my brother 's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith .

then go ahead go ahead ! go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed , you stupid , pigheaded , son of a what are you trying to prove ? with a decisive gesture terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt . then he goes to the wall and lifts joey 's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging . he puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way , and grins at her as he does so ; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before .

terry , you better stay in for a while . i 'll come and cook your meals . be sure you keep the door locked .

do what i told you . take care of charley .

terry , no , no ... .

get away from me .

it 's just a scratch . you wo n't die . she turns away from him .

it 's you who 's being hurt . by keeping it inside you , like a poison . sooner or later it 's got to come out .

lucky pop is n't home , he 'd kill you .

edie it 's

i do n't rate it .

much more , terry . much , much more !

it 's true .

i wo n't eat cheese for no cops , that 's for sure .

what are you going to do ?

what for ?

why keep harpin ' on it ? come on , drink up . you got to get a little fun out of life . what 's the matter with you ? i 'll play you some music .

if you do n't keep your neck in and your nose clean and you 'll never have no trouble down here .

you 've been off in daisyland , honey . everybody 's got a racket .

he was looking at everybody the same way . asking the same question .

i 'm not lookin ' to get crucified . i 'm lookin ' to stay in one piece .

naw , in the ring , a dive is-

i went pretty good for a while , did n't i , al ? but i did n't stay in shape and i had to take a few dives .

it 's quite nice .

wham ... .

i do n't know .

listen , you like beer ?

if another fella tries to take that perch away from him , he lets him have it .

the things that go on .

the golden warriors .

what for ?

thanks anyway .

i only live up there and across the roof .

i 'd better go in .

do you like pigeons ?

what-what ? where you been the last four five years ? outer space ?

i remember you were in trouble all the time .

man , you were a mess !

in braids ? that 's right .

it 's a regular college . it 's just run by the nuns . the sisters of st. anne .

i better see you get there .

see this arm ? it 's two inches longer ' n the other one . that 's years of workin ' and sweatin ' , liftin ' and swingin ' a hook . and every time i heisted a box or a coffee bag i says to myselfthis is for edie , so she can be a teacher or somethin ' decent . i promised your mother . you better not let her down .

are you trying to tell me terry is too ?

you go to hell .

now do n't give me a hard time .

is that all you 've got to say to me , father ?

if i spill , my life wo n't be worth a nickel .

a question of who rides who .

about edie ?

but you 've got to listen to me .

i do n't want to hear it in there .

baseball bats that 's just for openers . they 'll put the muscle on you , turned-around collar or no turned-around collar .

if i stick my neck out , and they chopped it off , would that be the end of it ? or are you ready to go all the way ?

what do you think ?

now listen , if you know who the pistols are , if you see them on the dock every day , are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one ? are you ? are you ? how about you , nolan ?

yeah , really !

yeah . my own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet i had it in me to hit the top and boy , if i wanted to , the things i could tell you about them guys

such as what ?

wilson yeah yeah i fought wilson .

well , it 'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it . do n't you think ?

i guess it 's pretty tough work at that .

what ?

you 're being served with a subpoena , mr. malloy .

o.k . o.k . without the bird seed . what do you want ?

you 're terry malloy , are n't you ?

you 'd be off the pier for good .

... .and you 'll tell johnny friendly .

doyle . joey doyle 's ... . ? ... .you 're his ... .

did n't you recognize him , dopey . that 's old man doyle .

how do you like them jokers ? taking me for a pigeon .

you 're doin ' lovely , terry , very lovely .

looking for me ?

my lead bird . he 's always on that top perch .

be sure they got enough water .

you ought to go home and take care of that

easy . easy , boy .

no advice . just whiskey .

listen , kid , why do n't you go home before johnny ... .

what 's wrong with your shoulder ?

keep the advice . give me the whiskey .

take it easy now , terry .

stow the receipt . i 'll take the cash .

that 's what i want to find out . we have to get help .

it frightens me .

in there .

well we certainly ca n't stay here . c'mon .

there 's an old cemetery on this road . i 've been there before .

we sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery . let 's turn back .

your pleasures of course !

for what ! ? !

you had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session .

the moon sinks lower into the hills ! we must hurry to the finish .

there are others .

your own pleasure comes only after mine , when i desire it . i am the sole ruler of the dark world . there is no one to challenge my authority here . my word is the law -- all powerful . < b > no one < /b > is to challenge that authority , < b > no one ! < /b > . is that understood ? it is my command .

ahh , she will be yours .

el dia de los muertos ... a celebration in her country .

a symbol , master .

... and what is this ?

then it is some service you desire of us .

aaaahhhh .

you know better than that .

you need not worry ... not just now , anyway .

aaahhnnnahnnnn .

aaarrrgggaahh .

aahhhhnnnaaahahnn . aaaaaahhhhooowwwoooooooooooooooooooooo !

listen , adele , the reason i called , that party is today instead of sunday . about eight-thirty , like only a few hours from now . so you 'll have to get hold of buddy , whatever he might be doing ...

you do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside ?

any idea where i could find buddy ? or glenn ?

i 'll say one thing for jack , he was never ugly or mean , or drank too much . he was very considerate , lights on or off , if you know what i mean .

why not ?

why you want to do that , to a frien ' ?

yes , around here . i was a mayishan in cuba before i come here . manuel the mayishan was my name .

you were his what , his box ?

adele ? you in there ?

no , you dump the van , meet me at the airport . i 'll take one of ripley 's cars .

i 'll go with you .

from the looks of those boys , the ripper too .

what ?

shit .

you remember buddy , do n't you , richard ?

half for doing what ?

it was n't about getting laid . i just wanted to know what might 've happened if things were different .

you know how i felt about her .

and she saw you ?

listen , i got ta get some better shoes , few other things before tomorrow . why do n't you drop me off at the ren cen , we 'll hook up later ?

they put a gun on you , you 'll go back .

tell me something , buddy . you know anyone who 's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life ? cause it occurred to me that everyone < u > talks < /u > about doing it , but i do n't know anyone who 's actually gone and < u > done < /u > it . do you ?

no doubt the man 's got some big-ass security system .

you did n't tell your sister about ripley , did you ? 'cause i do n't wan na go through that again .

she just sat there , looking right at me .

i 'm a tourist .

her phone 's probably tapped .

what ? !

we 'll leave first thing in the morning .

paper says there 's ten grand each on you , chino and lulu .

they pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want , nobody 'll know you .

there 's a store around the corner , i 'll be right back .

i know exactly what you mean . it 's just a feeling . you know , i could go for some wine tonight .

i 'm just saying she was n't scared .

you want to take her to my place and get cleaned up ? you come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes , `` oh , i had you all wrong '' ?

why you brought glenn into this , i 'll never know .

wait a minute . let me have your raincoat . somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes .

get the shotgun . and her purse . i 'd like to know who she is .

okay , honey , come on out of there .

the wall street guy ? oh , yeah . i did n't recognize him without his rug .

call and tell you .

yeah , why ?

but do n't you < u > do < /u > anything . you just have a seat , wait for me to get there .

what -- we already talked to her . that 's a dead end .

sounds to me like he liked having you around . i 'll see you , karen . mr. sisco .

yeah , but i had enough reason to believe he did , and i told you . so you had to at least suspect him .

when i was seeing carl tillman , i did n't know he robbed banks .

this fella holds you hostage , you talk about movies ?

you talked to him ?

really ? huh . he told me he did n't remember how many he robbed .

is n't that my report you 're holding onto ?

daniel burdon , fbi .

oh , is that right ? you going to shoot me ? nice girl like you ? i do n't think so .

you would n't shoot me , would you ?

you told me i can come 'cause i caught you digging the fuckin ' tunnel , saw you and lulu coming out of the bushes , thought maybe you two were making out .

you want , i tole you you can come . you all right , foley . i like you .

hello ?

christ , i know snoopy miller . he 's a fuckin ' wackjob thinks he 's sugar ray leonard . hangs out with a couple other grade-a nutcases over on the west side .

who ?

freezing . but i 'm getting warmer .

i 've seen 'em used on tv .

break and enter , shit . take it and git , how it 's done . do n't waste any time . that 's how you do it .

i was n't asking permission .

look , snoop , i do n't know what glenn promised you or what you think you 're gon na get , but the deal is me and buddy get half of whatever we take from ripley , understand ? how you and glenn cut up the rest is up to you .

low class of people there , snoop .

himey here 's a pro-toh-jay of mine . he 's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system .

i bet . how much ?

sign says `` shut the fuck up . '' or ca n't you guys read ?

you know what i mean .

what 're you now , a desperado ? put the guns down .

i do n't know about that . you ca n't do three falls and think you have much of a brain .

you 're not dumb .

i do n't know .

what about < i > my < /i > motive ? now i can say i fucked a us marshal . you think i will ?

i 'm just going to the bathroom .

i was n't sure you caught that .

you waved to me in the elevator .

i hear he did n't mean to . the cop fell as dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart .

he killed a police officer .

it 's your game . i 've never played this before .

i 'm partial to mountains myself . but if you like islands , we 'll make it an island .

one last score , that the idea ? move to some island .

i can just picture that , a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters .

let 's see . you could come on by my dad 's place , drop 'em off .

really . he has a cop 's face .

nothing .

bleeding on a country road .

it was may , 1934 , near gibsland , louisiana .

you 're full of interesting facts , are n't you ?

oh , you mean of bonnie and clyde ? hm . you ever see pictures of him , the way he wore his hat ? you could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him .

yeah , well , if it turns out i get shot like a dog , it 'll be in the street , not off a goddamn fence .

you know , this is n't gon na end well , these things never do .

sure .

we still talk , though .

uh-huh .

i do n't have to . i do n't rob banks .

i thought so , too .

how many was that ?

time i was convicted in california ? fbi told me i 'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer .

why , are you famous ?

so , what 's < u > your < /u > name ? it 'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway .

who , buddy ? yeah . he 's a good guy . back when we jailed together , he 'd call his sister every week without fail . she 's a born-again christian , does bookkeeping for a televangelist . buddy calls her up , confesses his sins , tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob .

the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me .

there is n't any . all this shit you got in here . what is all this stuff anyway ? handcuffs , chains ... what 's this can ?

you comfy ?

whose blood you got all over you ?

what happened to your shades ? someone finally step on 'em ?

you 're in civilization now , man , ease up .

use your head . the guys got five million lying around his house , you really think he 's gon na tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it ?

so . what 's your point ?

detroit . snoopy miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash .

who you talkin ' to , studs ? me , or buddy . i ca n't tell , you got those shades on .

okay . how many going out ?

dumbfuck glenn was right , there 's about five million worth in there , would n't you say , richard ?

good god ... they 're shooting midge !

a minute or two , you 're gon na wish you were .

jesus christ , what the hell are you doing here ? what 's going on ? who 's upstairs ?

how are you , richard ?

gentlemen . i think we 've calmed down now . have n't we , jack ?

the next time i walk into a bank .

who is ? but then you got ta look at a job as more than just work . you got ta look at it as peace of mind . as < i > security < /i > , you know what i mean ? i got offices in detroit , miami , boston , take your pick .

i was just thinking that i could use a guy like you , someone knows how to ask for things the right way . i 'm talkin ' about when you 're outta here . i mean , you ca n't rob banks for ever .

really ?

any time .

thanks for your help .

really ? well , i uhhh ...

you 're smart , ripley , you 'll tell this guy to fuck off .

yeah , could be . or maybe she thought we 'd have a lot to talk about .

cheaper i guess , take us both down in one van .

ten , you count the prison hospital in ohio i walked away from .

the hejira was the flight of mohammed from mecca in 622 .

if i did n't know you , glenn , by tomorrow you 'd be in jail or dead . look at it that way . go on .

i know , you 'll find me . jesus , i believe it . i keep thinking if you had n't driven me to federal court last summer , you would n't even know who i am .

i do n't know -- he does n't exactly confide in me .

but you say he has n't shown up , you think he backed out ?

rippin ' off ripley was my idea , but these guys , man , they 're into shit i ca n't handle .

for the car , for aiding and abetting a prison escape , and conspiring to do whatever you came here for .

jesus . how 'd you know about snoopy ?

glenn , take the exit .

wait . < i > have < /i > you helped him , glenn ? at this point , technically , i doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive . so you still have a choice . you can help him and risk going down again , get cuffed and shackled , hope to god you pull a reasonable judge , not some hard-on . or , if you want to play it another way ...

glenn ?

why 'd he have to do that to that girl ?

walk in a house with me , do this cross- dressin ' nigga named eddie solomon i used to sell to been dealin ' on his own .

yeah . if you can step up and actually do it . understand ? 'stead of just talking the talk .

me ?

if they 're not busted now , they 're gon na be . it 's wide open .

watch the road , boy . i like this town car . we can cruise the man 's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass .

i ca n't really go into it right now . i 'll just tell you it 's someone big .

listen , snoopy , i 'm on my way up to detroit and need a place to crash .

oh ...

hi , ray .

flyweight .

what 'd you fight , middleweight ?

i < i > was < /i > ...

was a she , name tuffy .

he said he stayed with maurice .

here ? in this house ?

no , i 'm not . maybe you know him . glenn michaels ?

you a lawyer ?

thanks .

that 's not maurice ?

i 'm looking for maurice .

my little girl , the tough babe .

he knew what he was doing . nobody forced him to rob banks .

i did n't have time .

yeah , but you talked all the way from gci to the turnpike . it sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping .

he 's pretty laid back , confident .

was it foley ?

no ?

the sig sauer you got me for my birthday .

huh .

i really got ta go .

you used to like it .

no thanks .

he 's still married though , huh ?

-- sig-sauer .38. i love it .

something better . open it .

like a fag .

how do i look , mama ?

out for the evening ?

not yet . where 's mr. ripley ?

yeah , someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport , called the number --

midge .

where you been hiding , dick ?

excuse me . snoopy ? did we settle the fish thing ?

i think it 's dunn & < u > brad < /u > street . but then , i could be wrong ...

what ?

thank you ...

uh-huh . you recall , did it say dead or alive ?

what is it with red ? i 've never seen him this way .

what , good-lookin ' sumbitch ?

do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform ?

how would i know .

are all the yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed , lieutenant ?

oh yeah . i liked it so much i 'm cutting you out of the squadron .

that was a nice little stunt you pulled , buzzing the base .

you 're walker , right ?

you guys know her ? ! i got ta have an intro ! man , i 'd like to --

mai-tai 's . i got this to tell ya , about mai-tai 's .

no , like ...

a m-missionary ?

of the four left , only one is full of fuel .

they 'll all fly , but -- oh , shit ...

and i 'm on yours . land of the free .

broomsticks instead of tail guns .

bullshit . we 've played with each other , pushed each other . this is different . like you want to prove that you 're better than me . who 's that for -- evelyn ?

i 'm out of ammo !

you hear my okay ?

six p-40 's .

auxiliary field at haleiwa , ten miles north of here .

how sweet . is that when you put the move on her ?

you left her . how 's that for a fact ?

yeah , right . anyway , you did n't know .

why be sorry ? that 's what you feel , it 's better to come out with it .

upset ? why should i be upset ?

it 's a test . if i asked her to come and she came , it would n't tell me anything . if i tell her not to come , and she comes ... then i know she loves me .

did n't you say you told her not to come ?

some other time . i do n't feel like a party .

the colonel helped me work it out .

land of the free ...

good shooting , rafe !

good shooting , danny !

the brass is afraid of sabotage . this makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service .

hey ! what is this , the planes all bunched up like that ?

well ... sure .

sorry .

i was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes . do you think that 's why we 're meeting . to help us say goodbye to rafe ?

... he said that ?

rafe 's folks had a crop dusting business , owned their own planes . real straight , frugal . my father was the town drunk . went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the dawn express came along . rafe and i were the only ones at the funeral . he took me back to his house , and i never left .

then wh-where do we land ?

colonel ... we 're all going . whether you make it or not .

i thought i 'd made it clear , i 'm not just putting this mission together -- i 'm leading it myself .

in flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes . you 'll be flying multi-engines here .

top secret means you help me pick the other pilots , train , and go -- without knowing where you 're going until it 's too late .

thank you , sir .

there are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible .

tell me something , dorie . a man as big as you -- and smart too , you knew where to come when your ship could n't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect ?

every other sunday . i 'm heavyweight champion of the west virginia .

dorie miller , 'mam .

win ?

how 'd you get this ?

wait , let me look at that ... you better come in here .

it 's all right . danny always said i see things with my emotions instead of my eyes .

i 'm just ... so amazed , so glad to know that you 're okay . you are okay , are n't you ?

i had to tell you in person . because there 's something else i need to say .

but you 're in the u.s. army , how could you --

there 's one thing i have to say . i 'm going away .

whatever you 're trying to tell me is n't good , is it . or it would n't be so hard to say .

danny 's not coming ?

nice to meet you , betty .

you too , lieutenant .

i have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission .

uncharged torpedoes have different balance .

the chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the jap patrols do , if any of the planes make it .

what if the japanese did invade ?

the time has come to strike ! or to sit and let the americans cut off our oil and our future . i know what you whisper to the others , yamamoto -- that the americans are strong . yet look at their leader .

i 've already got some in . i was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight . how would you like that ?

quite a bit more rain than usual this year . i hope it does n't spoil the rhubarb .

the last one was six hundred years ago . it 's about time for another one .

i hope so . at least i got to see you and grandma . has it ever worked before ?

let 's go .

it 's gon na rain again . every time i wash the car , it rains .

not from the guy with the lowest prices in town .

but i want you and scott to understand . do you think he loves janet ? maybe he 's smashed too many fortune cookies .

how do you like my hair ?

where were you ? you said you 'd be back at twelve .

what 's the matter ?

all right . what 's the scoop ?

he does ?

he is kind of cute , is n't he ?

yes . let 's stay in touch .

we 're going to take you home .

well , besides charlie , of course .

i do n't know how you do it . i 've never even dated anybody but charlie .

yeah . i 've got ta go . arthur 's picking me up soon .

michael fitzsimmons ! is he here ?

lucky lady . hi .

i 'll never give up .

you were terrific . and i kept trying to push you away but you would n't give up .

i 'll just set it right here .

what about janet ?

i wanted to apologize . i ca n't live without you .

you look awful , like you have n't slept in days . and so old .

i 'll love you , too , charlie . i 'll love you for twenty years .

i think we should get out of here . it 's going to rain .

i love you .

oh , charlie .

if you took the trouble to write it , then sure , i 'll take a look at it . but i 'm beginning to think that maybe there 's more to life than music . i wonder if people would still like me if i stopped being mr. excitement ?

what 're you doing here ?

i 'm trying to save you years of frustration ... waiting for a big break ... no . waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me .

but what has to be different ?

i want to know what 's going on . dolores told me that you and that scuzzball michael fitzsimmons ...

do n't be cruel to a heart that 's true .

yeah , i know . girls mature faster than guys . but last night , i was the one who put on the brakes . and you know why ?

this is a mistake . we better forget it .

charlie , let 's make love .

come on , let 's dance .

charlie , what do you think of richard norvik ?

i 'm fine peggy sue . and how are you ? are we talking on the phone ? are we pen pals ?

is this slow enough for you ?

where did you get that sweater ?

yeah . like that .

i thought it had a lot of merit .

want me to drive you home later ?

refresh my memory .

you know . about what we said on tuesday . it makes a lot of sense .

i call this the staccato .

hey , i can take a hint . you look great today .

no . you are the undead . you will live forever if you give me your twinkie . come on , let 's have it . you hate them anyway .

i vant to suck your blood . i also vant to suck your twinkie .

i 'll think of a way to sell , them . one day .

i know . put scott through college .

you do n't want them ? they 're going to make a big comeback any minute . mark my words , these lamps are going to ...

well , today 's saturday and it 's still not here .

come off it , peggy . and what do you mean your house ? this is my house . i paid for it , i 'm still paying for it .

charles , in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music , we 've always regarded you a a fine young man . we 've trusted you with our daughter .

are you for real ?

dolores , ca n't you be a little kinder to people ? you do n't even know the boy . if you were n't so neurotic and insecure , maybe you 'd shut up for a while and show some compassion .

first of all , richard is not a creep . he happens to be an exceptional person . if any of you gave him half a chance , you 'd find that out .

first a nerd and then a weirdo . what a bunch of nose pickers . i 'll tell charlie .

that commie beatnik ? what 's she doing with him ? wait 'll i tell charlie .

what if we 're witnessing the end of touch dancing ?

hey terry , what is that ? did peggy make it up ? i 've never seen that on bandstand .

he wo n't tell me , but i 've got my suspicions . and i do n't want any of that . do n't keep her out late .

it was my idea , grandma . i always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings .

if you believe it , darling , then i believe . being young can be just as confusing as being old . the things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday .

i 'm not going to marry him . i just went out with him once . i know ! why do n't we go to the movies tonight . just us girls . it 'll be fun .

it was beth 's idea .

i can dig that . bittersweet perfection . dogs of lust on leashes of memory ... yeah .

you think so ?

why not ? polygamy 's legal in utah .

i ca n't do that .

utah ? i thought you 'd be going to new york or paris . what 's in utah ?

now listen , this is the plan . as soon as school is finished we go to utah and ...

five more weeks of school . and ten minutes past graduation i 'm gone . to freedom .

yeah . i 'm surprised . it 's really old ... travels well though . you know , the world looks a lot better from up here .

i thought chicks like you traveled in packs .

coffee and a donut .

maybe you 're confusing his life with his work .

he 's a fisherman ! the most overrated writer of the century . i mean , he 's the perfect american author fat , violent , drunk ...

you do n't ?

look young lady , i grew up through the depression . i fought in the second world war . six days a week i get up and deal with the public , the bank and the bill collectors . and on the seventh day , when god rests , i do n't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool !

how did it go with the pantyhose ?

you mean to tell me that you invited this mr. fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea ?

you need a partner . there 's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars , mr. fitzsimmons . i 've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night .

this is your great invention ? would you wear those things ?

yes .

the hat business is in trouble .

this morning was good .

open it .

i want to help with the family finances . i want you to buy some stocks . and gold . by 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce . then you sell .

yes but i was a boy . and i still had hell to pay .

thank you.. i accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again .

peggy sue , watch your mouth .

i want everybody to hear because i do n't have anything to be ashamed of .

does everybody have to hear ?

do n't worry , it 's just a seasonal slump .

this is not giving blood . this is drunk .

what ? when did it happen ? your dad and i always expected you two to get married .

way to go , mom !

i do n't feel very festive .

is charlie pressuring you to do things you do n't think you should be doing ?

i 'm sorry , mom . i 'll call grandma back and apologize .

she did ? i love her so much , and i have n't seen her in such a long time . and grandpa barney . is he all , right ?

it was nobody . ah ... he 's a poll , taker . i 'm thinking of voting democrat this year . but do n't mention it to your father . how was school today ?

i 'm still here , are n't i ? i may as well enjoy myself . i 'm going to go to school today . dad , i want to apologize for yesterday . the car is a classic . use it in the best of health .

you 're looking pretty chipper this morning .

oh mom , i forgot you were ever so young .

i 'm home now .

chanel number five . that always reminds me of home .

mom !

you know , you two are wonderful parents . i 'm really going to try to behave myself .

they 're bad for you . they cause ... red lips .

why not ? they 're my favorite .

let 's do something together.. do you want to play monopoly ? or careers ... clue ... snakes and ladders ?

i think you should give up diving . it 's dangerous .

i remember when you got that locket , too . you were so excited i think you showed it to the whole school .

you were meant to you 're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to .

goodbye ? where 're you going ? what about our partnership ? i 'm making real progress with the microchip .

what 's the matter ?

me ? you went crazy ! you started taking your clothes off . i was putting them back on for you .

i could n't help it i loved him .

we were lying in the sand . it was my eighteenth birthday ... we were so awkward ... i would have married him anyway ...

oh boy . peggy , what are microchips ?

come on . you ca n't be serious .

ah . this is a biggie . forget sneakers . running shoes , jogging shoes , tennis shoes . fifty to two hundred dollars a pair .

when do we start ?

you 're taking advantage of a minor .

i 'm curious , but i do n't want to know . jeez , i hope you have n't been telling people what 's going to happen to them .

no offense , but for a person who says she 's lived an extra lifetime , you certainly are thick . money is power.. money makes people respect you ...

what if you 're not here tomorrow ?

i told you , i 've already lived my life . i do n't know how or why i 'm here , but you have to help me get back . i want to get back to my real life !

you look pretty good for a corpse .

you probably are crazy . wait a minute . is this some kind of joke ? i know what you all , think of me .

so you think time travel is possible ? for people ?

you can till it with whatever you want . from illusions to memory , from experience to innocence , from happiness to the entire universes

well , i think time is like a burrito . sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other .

all right . i 'll be in the physics lab . make it fourthirty . i have a rocket club meeting .

i 'm not doing any tutoring this year . i 'm too busy .

it really was n't that difficult .

well , you showed them . you 're rich and famous and successful . and you have a beautiful wife .

exactly ! i thought it might be some sort of blood condition ... immune deficiency or ...

how 'd you know that ?

i wanted to get geoff out of l.a. just start things over , you know ?

what ?

you sure did ...

what happened to you ?

uh ... no . you just ... look different than you sounded on the phone . please , come in .

he did . we buried him . there 's a place out in the woods ... if you bury something there , it comes back alive .

geoff , this is crazy . zowie did n't die .

i 'm not hungry .

just out .

i 'm going out , dad !

remember zowie , drew 's dog ? he got hurt again . i 'm going over to take a look at him .

i still ca n't believe she 's dead ...

how long ago did this guy retire ?

say your goodbyes . zowie 's going outside . you 're grounded , buddy . that 's the new law .

just until he heals up ?

drew , i do n't remember inviting zowie in for dinner .

is he gon na be okay ?

all the time .

go later ...

dies ?

i do n't know but i 'm not taking any chances ...

you think he 'd believe it if he did ?

maybe he was n't dead when we buried him .

the old indian burial ground .

there 's a better place ...

sorry about your mom . i could n't handle not having my mom around . just having gus ...

you know everything , do n't you ?

good . he said he 'd be over for dinner at eight ... i mean ... he misses you , mom ...

how long have you been here ?

yes , bob , i do . excuse me ? am i being fired ?

jesus .

you 'll have to get right on it , andy , we 're up against the statute of limitations .

charles is right behind me .

oh , you 're right , beckett , you do n't have an attitude problem .

really ? who thinks that , sir ?

what 's that on your forehead , pal ?

because they deserve to , walter .

close the law book .

that shit 's saving your life , you asshole !

fuck you . this shit 's probably not doing me any good anyway .

fuck you .

hold still . shit . the goddamn vein 's clotted . we have to go the goddamn hospital , so they can change the goddamn catheter .

yes . i think it will be a simple solution . they 'll put it in a syringe , inject it into your bloodstream . it 'll neutralize the virus . it 'll revitalize the immune system , and people with aids will become healthy again .

one hour !

you 're not going to like this . please try to smile ...

do n't do this , andy .

he 's upset , he 's sorry .

this is my partner . we keep records of hospital visits . nothing personal .

we 're waiting ...

a good start .

if it please the court , i 'd like to ask mr. beckett to remove his shirt , so that the jury can have an < u > accurate < /u > idea of what we 're talking about .

yes . on my torso .

do you have any lesions on < u > any < /u > part of your body , at this time , that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired ?

what do you love about it ?

i 'm an excellent lawyer .

no . i did n't .

what kind of person is that ?

want to hear my favorite aria ?

what ?

thank you .

no , we have to do it . but later , allright ?

what do you want ?

beckett . you seem ... better . energized , more alive ...

it 's me , you dork .

arline decision . supreme court .

one of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead .

who 'd you get ?

fine .

i knew you were going to say that . i do n't buy it , and i do n't see a case .

makeup .

hell , they are staring . what 's that shit on your face ?

i dove back into work , everything was fine . until the lesions started ...

continue .

thanks , beckett . i 'm real excited about it . what can i do for you ?

kids are great .

whoa-oh ! sorry , i ...

jesus christ , what happened to you ?

i thought i was supposed to be covering for you . god , andy , you look awful .

and it 's your contention , that when the partners were made aware of the lesions , they jumped to the conclusion you had aids and fired you .

that 's right .

as a homosexual , one is often forced to conceal one 's sexuality , is that right ?

some do . i did n't .

no .

i 'd heard of < u > something < /u > . the gay plague , gay cancer , but ... we did n't know how you could get it , or that it could kill you .

it 's impossible to know exactly when or how i was infected with hiv .

were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there , called aids , and that you could contract it through sexual activity ?

gay movies .

hold on , mom . there 's no way my client will go along with that .

i 'm fine .

andy ! this is a nice surprise . how are you , hon ?

hello ?

were you recently promoted ?

i said my earrings < u > are < /u > american . they 're african-american .

is that a question ?

your honor , if mr. beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair , would the defense ask him to park it outside ? we 're talking about aids , we 're talking about lesions . let 's < u > see < /u > what we 're talking about .

we object , your honor . it would unfairly influence the jury .

it does n't travel through the air , by breathing , or touching , right ?

leave that .

it 's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied . a cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming . do you agree ?

it satisfied me .

that 's correct .

people who want to bend the rules ...

but he 's got lots of other people 's lives to ruin ...

let 's put it this way , andy : your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure .

andy . before we begin , i 'd just like to say : everyone in this room is your friend .

relax ? i ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you !

are n't you ?

would you like to have a drink with me ? i just finished a game , i could use a beer . i do n't pick up people in drug stores every day .

great .

night , honey .

and the way they work out , pumping up , so they can be macho and faggot at the same time ... i ca n't < u > stand < /u > that shit . now i 'm being totally honest with you .

probably since she was born .

since when ?

lots .

how many do you know ?

not especially .

of course you have a case ! now , i want you to go with my assistant , iris , and fill out some forms . she 'll tell you about our fee arrangement . mrs. finley ? any back pain since the accident ? dizziness ? nightmares ?

you taught him a lesson .

we stuck his head in the latrine , after ten of us had used it .

going on ... like ... ?

hold it , joe . he wants to come back to work , chuck .

if it please your honor , we < u > hope < /u > to settle this matter .

joseph miller , your honor . macready and shilts legal services .

you have to make a decision : is this guy partner material ?

holy shit . did you , bob ?

andrew brought aids into our offices , into our men 's room . he brought aids to our annual goddamn family picnic .

dr. j. !

it 's good to be king , hey charles ?

... but we should n't have fired him ...

... keep them from that area , on grounds of relevancy . what , bob ?

... interview every employee , support staff , associates , partners . did < u > any < /u > of them know andy was sick ? < u > how < /u > did they know ? did he tell them ? did they notice something was wrong with his appearance ? none of this information got to the managing partners . we know that . make sure everyone else does too ... and beckett : i want to know everything about his personal life . did he frequent those pathetic bars on camac street ?

not sure where to go . i was just runnin ' away when this whole thing started . where you goin ' ?

probably okay to talk to me now .

you came for us ... .

what ? what is it ?

lookit . lookit !

do n't wan na miss this .

oh , sure . why not ? sounds like a hoot .

does n't seem like enough to turn back on , does it ?

leave the sled , let 's go , go , go !

no , we 'd never ... .oh , god , honey , you shoulda told me sooner .

you barely know them .

i ca n't ... .i ca n't ... .

truthfully ? i would n't know how .

what , you 're afraid ?

think you 've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck .

i promised them we 'd go back with more light . and that 's exactly what we 're gon na do..

riddick ? how close ?

as fast as you can .

one or two .

canyon ahead . i circled once to buy some time to think .

saw something i did n't like .

where are the sand-cat tracks ? why are n't we still following them ?

actually ... that 's what i been askin ' myself .

we can , ca n't we ? trust you ?

been a long time since anyone 's trusted me . that 's somethin ' right there .

riddick ... was thinkin ' we should make some kind of deal . just in case , you know , this actually --

they 're coming .

fairly fuckin ' ironic , would n't you say ? slamlight 's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here . three ass-kick suns . maybe i did do a few people . but not this one . no ma'am , not this time .

you did this ? to yourself ?

tell me about the sounds . you told them you heard something right before ... . if you do n't talk to me , johns 'll take another crack at it -- at your skull .

possibly .

spirits . anything over 45 proof burns well .

cargo hold , everyone in the cargo hold . lesgo , lesgo , lesgo .

no , no , you 're right , fry . what 's to be afraid of ? my life is a steamin ' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow . so i say mush on ! canyon 's only couple hundred meters , after that we 're in skiff city ! so why do n't you just butch up , stuff a cork in that kid , and get --

i was wrong . i admit it . my bad , okay ? now let 's just go back to the ship .

look , we got ta think about everyone now -- the kid especially . how scared is she gon na be out there ?

never said you were a hype , either .

you 're not a real cop , are you ? just some mercenary who goes around talkin ' about the law like --

oh , this is a dangerous game you 're playing , johns .

we 're not sure < u > when < /u > it happens , so let 's not --

... need those cells from the crash ship . shit , still got ta check out the hull , patch the wings --

so what happened ? where are they , then ?

25 kilos each , huh ?

15 6-gigs here ... 90 gigs total ... other ship carries 20-gig cells , so ... five . five total to launch .

how many ?

thought you did n't believe his story .

i assume he licked it clean .

like my pistola .

sorry . thought i heard something .

so now you know .

hey . you can tell me , carolyn .

what 'd owens mean ? 'bout not touching the switch ?

thought you found his restraints over there . toward sunset .

i do n't need his life story . is he really that dangerous ?

be my choice . already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --

amazing . i 'm johns .

hey , who ?

ask if anyone has anything in cargo ! anything to drink !

well ? is it just the pump ?

so what , we should both go down too ? out of sheer fucking nobility ?

oh , no . not owens , not ... . wai ' , wai ' , wait . < u > i 'm owens < /u > . right ?

the sled as a shield ... .

what ?

chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage . to know god , better , yes , but to know yourself as well .

you know who muhammad was ?

think a soul could get lost there ? with all those pilgrim-types ?

there is no `` safe . ''

he 's running us 'round in circles . look for yourself . look !

`` god is great , '' yes ?

oh , so i 'm disposable ?

maratha crow-bill war-picks from northern india . very rare .

be surprised what these will fetch in the taurus system . here . this wooten here -- easy , easy . very rare .

king tut 's tomb ... .

... then we saw this .

just wonderin ' if we do n't need a bigger piece of chum .

then let 's not name the thanksgiving turkey , okay ? i assume you still got a shiv .

what 's her name , anyway ?

so which one caught your eye ?

do n't wan na feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent .

nice embellishment .

sacrifice play . hack up one body , leave it at start of the canyon . like a bucket of chum .

kept calling it `` murder '' when i did it .

what if you 're one of five ?

six of us left . if we could get through that canyon and lose just one , that 'd be quite a fucking feat , huh ? a good thing , right ?

ai n't all of us gon na make it .

they been nose-open for her ever since we left . they go off blood .

aw , this ca n't be happening to me ... .

not afraid of the dark , are you ?

if you were me , i 'd kill us both . c'mon , you wan na sit at the grown-up table or not ?

you 'd cut me loose , boss ?

truth is , riddick , i 'm tired of this head-up shit . i wan na be free of you as much as you wan na be free of me .

for what ? the honor of goin ' back to some asshole of a cell ?

here 's the deal . you work without the chains , without the bit -- without the shivs . you help us get off this rock ... .

so much for my cocktail hour .

'cuz they could n't hunt shit with these things , be my guess .

take it .

maybe they had weight limits , you do n't know .

not a star-jumper .

seal the cave ?

well ? for a time the ancients kept humans as household pets . until the lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed . keep digging cornelius . you 'll find evidence of the master of this house : an ape .

a doll alone proves nothing . true . but the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit .

i 've seen some of your fossils and artifacts . they 're worthless .

we 've never meant to be treasonable , sir . but up there , in the face of that cliff , is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts .

how did you know we 'd come here ?

what are you doing there ?

yes . i have to agree . from all you 've found so far , his position 's as good as yours .

to the diggings i worked at a year ago . it 's a three day ride across the eastern desert , near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours .

we 'd better get started . if the mounted police pick up our trail , they 'll come this far at least .

oh , cornelius , show some strength !

and even if it were n't , why fly ? where would it get you ?

now , just a minute --

dear , you 're a scientist . do n't you believe your own eyes ?

it 's a stunt . humans do n't write .

zira , come on . you know they ca n't -- oh oh . here comes number one .

the blood transfusion .

watch . hello , bright eyes . how 's our throat today ?

no .

none at all .

which direction ?

any sign of dangerous ionization ?

good question . landon -- check your communications kit .

what do you mean , made it ? i 'm an animal psychologist , that 's all . we do n't have any authority .

these animals are dirty , doctor . they stink , and they carry communicable diseases . why are n't they cleaned up before they 're brought here ?

sustained .

sustained . your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature .

objection ! these remarks are profane and irrelevant .

well , dr. zira ? this is a man , is he not ?

tell the court , bright eyes -- what is the second article of faith ?

do as i say .

you could get hurt doing that , doctor .

try telling them our names .

okay . you read me well enough . why ca n't i read you ?

and the glory , do n't forget that . there 's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere . it 's probably turned green by now , and nobody can read the name plate . but never let it be said we forget our heroes .

straighten me out on something . why did you come along at all ? you volunteered . why ? i 'll tell you . they nominated you for the big one and you could n't turn it down . not without losing your all-american standing

long pause ) you know it .

it 's a little late for a wake . she 's been dead nearly a year .

you do n't seem very cut up about it .

we 're some three hundred and twenty light years from earth . on an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of orion . that could be bellatrix .

well ? where are we ? have any notion , skipper ?

forget it . abandon ship .

what signal ?

that 's the boy . keep 'em flying .

i 'll start by following the shoreline . and my nose .

disillusioned ... but vindicated ! i 've been right all along . you ca n't trust the older generation . it 's a matter of values --

fine . just let her out .

zira does n't want your female .

she comes along too .

so you can talk . i 'm dr. zira 's nephew . this abduction was her idea . you 're not really going to the zoo . that 's just our cover story in case we 're stopped . although i do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --

gorilla hunters ...

a man , dr. maximus .

you destroyed his memory ! his mind ! his identity ! and , you want to do the same to me !

let us assume , as common sense dictates , that the prisoner 's story is false . but if he does not come from another planet , then surely he sprang from our own . yes , sprang . as an animal psychologist , i have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute .

since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense , he asks that this statement be read into the record .

thats a lie !

sustained . in all fairness , dr. zira , you must admit the accused is a nonape , and therefore has no rights under ape law .

by your leave , mr. president -- the tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry .

do n't look for it , taylor . you may not like what you find .

because you are a man . and you were right -- i have always known about man . from the evidence , i believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy . his emotions must rule his brain . he must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself .

where else , but in a cage , does man belong ?

sure . in a cage .

cease fire ! withdraw !

all right , let 's see if you 're willing to put that statement to a test .

i admit that where there 's one mutant there 's probably another . and another . a nest of them . where 's your nest , taylor ? where are your women ?

then you admit --

i take it you do n't believe the prosecutor 's charge -- that i 'm a monster created by dr. zira .

what about it ?

what about me ?

we ca n't .

taylor , please -- do n't treat him that way .

taylor , you ca n't .

taylor ! tell him .

taylor , please --

what 's the diagnosis , doctor ? a touch of the sun ?

you want her that much ?

maybe not .

actually , you 're a different breed . this creature will never evolve .

you 're going back to the forbidden zone ?

taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this . remember that men all look alike to most apes .

no , i swear -- i never saw this man before .

what is this ?

there ! can you believe it ? i looks like he 's talking .

but there 's the doll , sir .

mr. president , i believe the prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with bright eyes .

this is his assertion .

dr. zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert .

he 's dead ! where ? ... you saw him ?

elias is dead . join up with the platoon . move it .

do n't tell me how to fight this fucking war , 'lias , you go crying to fucking brigade on your time . out here you belong to me . now move .

you - you 're going to fuckin ' jail , buddy , you ai n't getting away with this one ! ! ! ! !

bob , i got ta bad feeling about this , i ... i 'm telling you i got a bad feeling , man , i do n't think i 'm gon na make it ... y'know what i mean ?

yeah , what is it ?

yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard i found in the ammo crate . i 'm gon na put it in this asshole 's crotch , see if he can walk .

so what 's the problem ?

that reminds me , i got ta take a shit .

don you worry bunny , youse a killer anyway .

das right dude . you be tryin ' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him down . time 's be coming , my man , when de black man 's gon na throw off that yoke .

wrong ? you ai n't ever been right - 'bout nothing . and dig this you assholes and dig it good ! barnes been shot 7 times and he ai n't dead , that tell you something ? barnes ai n't meant to die . only thing can get barnes ... is barnes !

you 're wrong man ! any way you cut it rhah , barnes is a murderer .

yeah ! i got two of them fuckers ...

hang tough , gator . hang in there , man , you 're gon na be ok ... just hang on .

taylor - get your ass over here . move !

come on man !

in '65 - yeah . now ... no . what happened today 's just the beginning . we 're gon na lose this war ...

barnes believes in what he 's doing .

yeah . i love this place at night . the stars ... there 's no right or wrong in them , they 're just there .

... do n't feel like it either .

dawn ...

she was a crossbreed , chinese and polish .

what did n't she do . she fucked the living shit outta me , that 's what she did !

yeah . no pain in my neck now . feels good .

hey that 's great king , that 's great ... you take it on home for me , you tell 'em king ... got your address right ? you know where you can reach men , man . anytime !

'people say i 'm the life of the party cause i tell a joke or two although i may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside i 'm blue ... '

who gives a shit !

... there 's nobody .

must be somebody ?

what are the heads ?

yo getting there taylor . you be cool now and i 'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads ' .

fuck it , do n't mean nothing , no such thing here as a coward , done your best man , next time y'do better .

... you know that night we got hit ... i ...

go on , whatcha got ta lose , yo ' here now ...

you okay man ? neck botherin ' you ?

shit , too bad we in base camp anyway .

you volunteered for this shit man ?

knock it off ! we got two men need attention here . police up your extra ammo and frags , do n't leave nothing for the dinks . hoyt , junior , carry gardner .

they do n't know shit barnes , and chances are we gon na run into something .

what are you talking about !

so he got a reduced and come over here . nam 's his freedom man , nam 's his pussy . three years he been here .

the good lord works his revenge in strange ways .

... and you know how many times he done been shot ? seven times ! seven .

barnes gets killed , his jaws 'd go on clacking ...

sheeit , beats burning hutches anyway ...

merle ?

whatcha doing in the underworld taylor ?

barnes took a bullet right there . at ia drang valley ... and the cocksucker survived - that 's baaad man . that 's his high , baby . high on war !

bah , you 're a child , lerner . rhah do n't waste time on you .

this is one time we could sure use elias .

right ...

hey lieutenant i did n't ask for this job , i ...

begging your pardon lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody 'd see them - i got five live bodies left ...

i do n't like being referred to as babe , or addressed as baby . i do n't like your possessive attitude , nor your hints of secret knowledge . in fact , to be very frank , mr. mitchell , i do n't think i like you .

betty , this is margo west . she wants to meet you . miss mayfield .

if you change your mind about the cocktail party , or anything else , give me a buzz .

i 'm trying very hard to be polite about it .

the brush-off , huh ?

nobody gets invited to clark brandon 's parties . they just go .

i 'm sure you have .

i 'm not in the mood for dining and dancing .

yes ?

i have a darned good idea you 're name is n't betty mayfield at all .

very nice mitchell turns .

well..

i 'm afraid there 's nothing i can do about it , mr. mitchell .

my name 's larry mitchell . i live in vancouver .

possibly , miss .

well ... they have to service the plane ... and get a pilot down to the field , unless there 's one hanging around there still ... and then they have to get the immigration officer ...

bank ?

and that nasty man that followed us last night . you did n't kill him .

yes . yours . you have n't murdered anybody . you killed mitchell . was n't that an accident ? it must have been . if you kill a blackmailer , you kill him dead -- so that he ca n't talk anymore .

i guess i 'm a little screwy . maybe i could believe it . should i try ?

you-killed-him ?

not this one . and not mitchell .

he 'll come back ... they always come back when you give them money .

that man that was following us last night -- he did n't come back this morning . i 'm beginning to wonder about him , too . was he really following me -- or you ?

nobody believed i was n't in on it . i was just a dumb-smart collage boy , and he was my father . i thought it was a legitimate business . he was a politician , with fingers in a lot of pies . i never saw the pies . they had names . for the record . innocent names . you know where that kind of money comes from , do n't you ?

so could you . but our records were a little against us .

larry mitchell found out . so you killed him .

including killaine .

that , and the fun of it .

if you 're doing all this just for me .

my father died in jail , and he was twice the man i am .

you would n't like it . i 've been there .

it 's the frame on the picture . but not if you say so .

do you have to leave the note ?

killaine ...

i was tried for murdering my husband . guilty . the judge set the verdict aside . there was one man on the jury -- -- but he was afraid . they were all afraid -- of my father-in-law . that man followed me last night -- he came from him of course . my father-in-law will never give up . never . he promised me that . so i came to vancouver , b.c . as far away as i can get from north carolina . and it happens all over again . almost the same thing . almost the same way . do you wonder about this --

wrote it in the waiting room of the hudson bay store . with somebody 's pekingese trying to climb into my lap . perhaps you 're right . perhaps i did n't mean it . all i know is that i 'm licked .

if you meant it , you would n't show it to me , betty . or am i supposed to deliver it to dear inspector killaine ?

i hated to go to that place . i almost went to the police station instead .

i 'm in the hudson bay company 's store . that man last night -- the one that followed me --

that 's the second round i 've lost tonight . that fellow hurt me .

why ?

he was following us -- but he 's not a policeman .

he 's a fellow with a very hard knee , and he knows how to use it .

then he 's got to be a detective .

i did n't notice him .

what time is it ?

that 's putting it mildly .

there 's one thing i may as well tell you . you 'll find it out anyhow . i tried to run away -- when i found him out there on the balcony . there was n't any plane .

go ahead ... if you want to . it does n't matter .

he was a great boy for that . what else ?

you said it was n't a tragedy .

he does n't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor .

you 're sure mr. brandon wo n't mind ?

no . are you really going to drink that stuff ?

sure . but i 'd hate like the dickens to be held to everything i 've said before , would n't you ?

as i said before ...

brandon . clark brandon . fellow about my age . lot of money ... that he did n't make . former american . now naturalized in canada . social standing indeterminate . manners not quite perfect . scotch superb .

i see .

ale . i do n't mind .

but even if you were in love with me .

what proper grounds ? you ca n't be in love with me . you hardly know me . i 'm not in love with you .

because you think your in love with me ?

that 's something i ca n't spare you . but i wo n't do it myself .

that 's my hard luck -- i 'm man enough to tell you about it -- and not be sorry .

i 'm about to be very silly . a man passes a girl on the street -- a very lovely girl -- his eyes meet her eyes , and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart -- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd -- and he says to himself , `` there goes my lost love '' -- and it 's true -- if he never sees her again , it 's still true . of course , after a while , he forgets -- or almost forgets -- because after a while we forget almost everything . but this man is a copper . he gets orders -- routine orders -- to go to a place and investigate a murder -- and everything points to a certain girl .

i would n't make you talk about it . my job is the death of marry mitchell . why ca n't you give me your confidence ?

the police always do , do n't they ?

but not in the investigation of a major crime , i hope .

i 've never been to florida .

florida ?

care for a stroll outside ? beautiful morning . the air is like wine , the sky is a deep blue .

they 're all crude , when they do n't work . had breakfast ?

yes .

stop saying you 're sorry . i want information , not regrets .

regimental ! seaforth highlanders .

there 's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger .

you did n't ask a question . you made a speech .

and there 's a mr. goble to see you . says his business is personal .

get it in half an hour .

a thousand .

sorry . another client paid for that . you can hire me not to use it .

for two hundred ?

bluff . you 've waited too long .

i 'm sorry . this thing has just knocked me silly . how long do we have to wait for this police character ?

they still hang women in canada , i 've heard .

leave that one lay .

and without much discrimination .

sometimes .

martini .

what 'll you have , margo ?

what 's this in favor of ?

the new ones are fine . the last set i had gave me all kinds of trouble .

how are your teeth getting along ?

i 've got good ears .

no more for me , thanks . remember what i said . i ca n't interfere with the law .

no idea .

how could mitchell ? after that act he put on up here , is it likely she 'd let him in ?

and old man clarendon ? he had a motive , too . margo and her money .

not if she knew she would n't be believed .

would that make me a heel ?

that must hurt .

i would . fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap . wonderful thing , money is . remember what somerset maugham said about it ?

no .

on miss mayfield 's balcony.. beside the chaise , i picked it up . do n't ask me why . i ought to know better .

where ?

thank you .

that 's what i thought , at first . maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party . with my liquor of course .

you do n't throw guests out , brandon .

did i do something wrong ?

i 'm afraid this is all for the moment .

you could have got in that room , just as you got in here . how do i know you did n't kill larry ?

what are you doing here ?

i 'm getting positively haggard . in a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved .

thank you . it is rather late ... and i 'm not young anymore . good night .

men like you do n't need orders .

how important would it have to be ? it 's only murder , inspector .

i 'd suggest a telegram . something like this : chief of police , san francisco . a licensed private detective named named martin j. goble , address so-and-so , has been found murdered within our jurisdiction . his partner , name something-something greer , refuses to give us any information . correction . refuses information necessary to our investigation . can you assist ? signed detective sergeant driscoll , vancouver , british columbia , police .

greer and goble in the call building , san francisco . just like you thought ... two murders in two days . different places , different methods , different people . nothing connects them , but a telephone number .

you win , inspector . you win all along the line . why did n't we think of brandon before -- or did we -- some of us . yeah . of course you did . when a suspect thinks he 's safe , you go on letting him think he 's safe . wait for a mistake .

how did he know he 'd get the chance ? he could n't have arranged it .

this is the shell . what about the gun ?

pretty big chance , huh ?

before i took the story and closed the case , i 'd want to know a lot more about these people . i 'd want to know just about everything about them .

she did n't seem the type to lam out -- even if she got the chance . that stuff was all gone through last night . anything special you 're looking for , inspector ?

correct , inspector . a woman 's gun . u.s. 125 caliber ammunition in it . it was on a table in there .

i hate to pull rank on you sergeant , but once in a while ... for moral purposes ... you might address me as `` inspector '' . in moments of extreme desperation , you might even call me `` sir '' .

you would still have planted information that clarendon knew about the gun -- and not as an accusation , but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession . very neat . good morning , mrs. west .

perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems .

you could n't possible have traced it this soon -- not possibly .

it was clarendon . he knew i had the gun in my bag .

anybody could commit suicide , if he felt low enough . i 've felt it myself .

this gun permit was issued to clark brandon ?

no doubt about that one .

what are my orders , sir ?

you 're a young man . you 're romantic . you think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together . you think a soft voice means a soft heart . you 'll grow out of that .

i do .

we lifted seven fairly good prints from miss mayfield 's toilet articles . washington ought to teletype us within a few hours .

i disagree , sir . as inspector in charge of the case i have the right to form that opinion , the right to act on it .

this girl is a murderess , killaine .

nobody 's covering her , i detached the officer assigned to that duty .

a little of both , sir , and perhaps not quiet enough of either .

are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop ?

how do you do , sir .

i 'm sorry . i forgot about calling for you .

of course .

i did n't mean it that way i 'm sorry .

i 've always been a heel . i guess i always will be .

correct . i could n't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me .

splendid . now she can return the compliment .

yes .

well , i 'd hate to be a nuisance .

actually , we 've only just met . but we 're quiet good friends .

i do worry about susan . have you known her long ? she has n't mentioned you .

so i can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.i shall be fulfilling a citizen 's duty .

if we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost . everyone must have a memory , everyone needs to be a historian . in this country , for example , we 're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present .

to ann .

yes .

tom , daddy would like to see you in the garden . and will you ask betty to bring us some coffee . and remember to say 'please ' .

it 's kind of you to see me .

give them here . this tells you how the women 's peace camp came to be set up . all local women at first , then we had support from women and men all over the country .

this is jill , carol , betty , mandy , louise , pete over there , and i 'm carmen .

sit on that log , dear .

charles ! i did n't know you were back . have a good holiday ?

of course .

it 's everything we wanted . a very good read . a terrific piece of work . so , here 's to you and suez .

thank you .

james ... i ca n't begin to tell you how pleased we all are . congratulations , and i really mean it .

yes , please .

are you going to have coffee ?

... from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on suez ...

shall we have a drink or something ?

that 'll be fun

what did he want ?

i have n't really thought about it .

i think we 're ready now , thank you . and how was norfolk ? did you get on with my mother ?

you do n't trust me .

me too .

again ?

i called you a taxi .

that must be rather nice , in a way . i mean , you do n't have any --

both dead .

mummy and i , we were more like lovers , really , or sisters . then a couple of years after daddy died , and not long after i left oxford , she started seeing various men and i was furious . i really was upset . i stopped going home . i never phoned . i went round telling everyone how awful her books were . and she hardly seemed to notice , and that made me angrier . then i got a job i was interested in , and i started to see lots of men , and i suppose i grew up a little and began to understand . so i wrote her a long letter , almost seven pages , saying how sorry i was , and how i was worried that we were drifting apart . and do you know , she wrote me a poem , a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters .

no , there 's a fourth . numbness . you do everything right , but you feel nothing either way .

good theory . but i like my mother . i have no aversions to what she does .

you do n't like flashbacks because your mother 's a historian .

really ? i thought those long flashbacks were extremely good .

and i did n't like that man .

i think it went on rather too long .

i 've known susan for more than fifteen years . james , we 're old allies .

susan and i are very old friends , james .

big mistake , i think . you might have learned a lot .

i 'll ring you .

will it be fun ?

sorry . got held up . what are you doing here ?

on the torture of very small children , but do n't start telling them about their rights --

far too long .

no need to thank me , if you do n't want to . just pay for these drinks .

ah , ah . there 's more . the piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left-wing historian and he dazzling daughter . then the news editor , who happened to be in the room , said that years ago , when he worked on the guardian , anne barrington had written a very good piece on ... guess ... suez . it was 1966 , the tenth anniversary .

jeremy , just let me see what you 've got .

let me see .

bastard .

nonsense .

any sign of the goddess barrington ?

not here .

what about the cromwells ?

do you want to hear my list of english kings and queens ?

have you come to talk about me ?

she 's not my mother , anyway . my mother 's in italy .

okay , i will .

terrific .

no , thanks dad .

and joe ramage - do you remember him ? he comes and helps out in the shop .

that 's good .

what would you call it ?

i 'll tell you another thing . we might have led the world once into the industrial revolution , now we lead with television commercials . we 're the best , it 's as simple as that . even the americans will admit it now ... the camera work , the acting , the scripts , special effects . we 've got the lot . nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films . that food you 're eating .

i just might give you a ring when we get back to london . there 's one or two things i 'd like to ... will you let me have your number before you leave ? have you ever watched a commercial being made ?

it was incredible . he came back , made a pompous little bow and said , 'my dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish . ' and he 's promised not to talk to the press .

we 're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools . world history since 1945. twelve programmes , lots of stock film .

actually , i 've been once today already . i 'll stay here with him .

do n't you want to walk , tom ?

three seconds ... two ... one ...

the guy you killed was an off duty cop ! if you get out of here they 'll nail you wherever you land . they have a new thing called radar . maybe you 've heard of it .

look , bodhi man . people are dead . the ride is over .

and let my policy expire ? sorry .

where 's roach ?

i 'm not armed .

wild , ai n't it ? ! see , we exist on a higher plane , you and i. we make our own rules . why be a servant of the law johnny u ... when you can be it 's master ?

she 'll be fine , rosie wo n't do anything . at least not as long as i meet him at a certain place and time , about ... let 's see ... ... six hours from now .

one thousand feet . pull the goddamn cord !

i 'll take that as a yes .

utah , you copy bruddah ?

you got ta earn trust .

so , who ... uh , who packed my chute ?

'one shot stopping ' ... good , very good . i like you , johnny . i like you because you 'll sacrifice anything to win . i respect that . it elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise . here , hold it . check out the weight .

how you figure ?

yeah , right , vision is highly over- rated .

i know that part . tell me something i can use , here .

football 's a man-made game . you keep score with numbers . but in this , there 's no field , no rules , no opponent . just you and the wave .

come with tyler . she knows .

you always talk like this ? you 're not gon na start chanting or anything are you ?

what 's their program ?

friends of yours , huh ?

there 's nobody else here ...

well is there anyone else here that might have seen him ?

you sure he is n't out back ? you mind if i go take a look ?

yeah ? what ?

take your hand off my shoulder right now .

the correct term is babes , sir . uh , this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech . otherwise penetration is not possible , sir . of the social infrastructure , i mean .

what ?

zero distortion , sir .

eating solid breakfasts , utah ?

cole and munoz ? i been on this case for two years .

nooo ! !

time for lunch .

no way . not yet . come on .

last time you got a feeling i had to kill a man , which i always hate because it looks bad on the report .

yeah , or cashing a check .

cute . he was inside for about 20 minutes . the other guy , roach , waited in the truck . they were scoping it out , right ? !

did he rob it ?

this zen master surfer .

when did harp say they 'd have the warrant ?

... felony b and e , three months in juvey . better . felony assault . postgraduate work at chino . excellent . i 'm lovin ' it . what about the brother ? great ! another model citizen . these guys really fit the profile .

big zippo so far . how about you ?

no . but let 's do it , anyway . it 's gon na bug the shit out of harp .

guy 's the toxic avenger .

johnny , all i can say is we better come up with something real soon .

surgical . look at them separate the dye packs . dick and ronny know their jobs .

reagan usually drives . stolen switch car , they leave it running at the curb , looks parked from a distance . when they run , they dump the vehicle and vanish . and i mean vanish .

never go for the vault . they never get greedy .

they do n't go for the vault ?

yeah , they control the room well . stick strictly to the cash drawers .

johnny ... what 's going on ? i do n't get it ... did i do something ?

look at you .

i can barely do this in broad daylight .

swell 's here , johnny . bodhi always knows .

i 've seen that kamikaze look , johnny . you 've got it . and bodhi can smell it a mile away . he 'll take you to the edge ... and past it . hey , bodhi .

bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies . i hope you 're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of bodhi 's moonies .

he rents it for the summer . bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around . most a these guys ca n't keep a job . when the swell comes , they 're gone , they have to ride .

yeah , you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it , a big strong stud like you should n't have any problem . right ? ! well you figured wrong , dork !

six others , u.s. issue jungle boots . they came in from the north , then followed the guerrillas .

we 're not going .

we take her and she 'll give away our position , every chance she gets . no prisoners , dillon .

that 's right , i set you up . you 're a veteran at this , dutch , i had to .

probably another rebel patrol . they operate in here all the time .

mean anything to you ?

you do n't know how much i missed this , dutch ! ! ! once you get this in your blood , you never get it out ! ! !

those eyes ... disappeared . but i know one thing , major ... ... i drew down and fired right at it . capped-off two hundred rounds and then the mini-gun ; the full pack . nothin ' ... nothin ' on this earth could have lived ... not at that range .

thanks .

put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back . we 'll bury him in the morning .

we found 'em both , dead . and the gear from the chopper . if they 're central american , i 'm a fuckin ' chinaman . by the looks of 'em , i 'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are cia . another thing , major , we were lucky ... couple of those guys we waxed are russians , military advisors by the look of it . something big was about to happen here .

someone else will be going in with you .

same business , guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper ... followed by men with american equipment ...

you 'll want a cocktail dress then . turn . you have a beautiful figure . a little too out in the open but simply lovely . size six ? do you need shoes ?

we can reach an understanding on this .

i 'd like to find out . you do n't know anything about me either . that 's why people have lunch .

what ?

you what ?

the real estate possibilities are endless . most of the yard we 'll just level . i talked to a couple of developers , under the table , of course , and they said --

storage , i think .

what 's that long building over there ?

quiet . would i get the loans ?

how ?

it is < u > not < /u > your company . it 's a public company . and i < u > am < /u > going to acquire it . either i buy from the other stock holders , or i buy from you .

what i did with those companies was perfectly legal .

you 're packing .

it felt good .

it was good .

it 's what i do for a living . it 's how i make money .

right .

vivian , do n't be afraid of what you do n't know . that 's the fun of it .

but do n't they have it in english ?

if it 's in italian , how will i know what they 're saying ?

sorry . you 're not paying me to ask you question like that .

the opera .

i 'll guard them and you with my life .

you wo n't .

what 's that ?

fuck off .

well , it 's true . just pay me what you owe me and i 'm gone .

can we talk about this ? can you just try to calm down ?

i 've been with stinking old men who 've made me want to puke but i 've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight .

i do n't know what you 're talking about .

ready to stomp sod ?

i really doubt anyone here frequents hollywood boulevard .

what about dinner ?

good .

was someone rude to you ?

you liked the guy , though .

you 're forgiven .

i 'm sorry .

hello ?

i think you 'll approve .

go by yourself then . where you taking me anyway ?

let 's hope so . you 'll get some more clothes tomorrow . i 'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp . got it ?

never answer the phone . ever .

but you want days too .

what ?

all right . how much for the week ?

not ... quite .

sorta like stealing cars and selling 'm for parts , huh ?

assets are anything of value a company owns . sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole . by selling them off , i make a profit .

by breaking up a company 's assets --

... dollars ?

why ?

they should be . they 're both good at it .

i 've known a lot of everybody .

and why do you say that ?

uh-huh .

right . so ! in town on business ?

well , the meter 's running , it 's your money . speaking of which , cash 'll do . in advance .

diet coke .

better believe it .

edward ... you got it !

you could n't afford it .

vivian , how much to put up with me for the entire night ?

if you 're making fun of me , i do n't like it .

so do day jobs .

what 's your name ?

okay , what < u > ho < /u > tel ?

not exactly .

no .

sit ... and spin .

the price just went up to ten .

sure . for five bucks .

actually , i 'm a movie star out for a walk .

good afternoon , mr. harris .

my what ?

of course , yes . if you 'll excuse me just a moment --

all this because of that whore !

i do n't think there 's any sense in --

we just did .

bill stuckey , vivian . my wife , elizabeth .

i want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now .

someone 's loaning it to him . get on it right away .

goddamit ! where is he getting the money to fight ?

no one you know .

eight o'clock . kross is bringing his son . very bright kid , watch yourself with him . who 's this girl you 're taking ?

i 'm here .

i 'll see him alone . everyone knows you 're my muscle . we 'll make it social . tell kross i 'll meet him for dinner . tonight if you can arrange it .

edward , if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the wall street journal .

really ? some high class gold digger who speaks french better than i do ? no , thank you . i just got off the phone with one .

give me your car keys , will you , i 'm going back to my hotel .

cool your jets a second . here 's some money .

couple a hours .

go for the bucks .

dummy .

it was great .

kit , i left that money for you days ago .

carlos . i still owe him two hundred bucks ...

kit , listen , the guy last night , the one in the ferrari , i 'm at this hotel , the regent beverly wilshire , it 's this absolutely unbelievable place and he 's hired me for a whole week and kit , listen , he 's paying me three thousand bucks ! we can get out of the apartment . we can get out of this town . we can do anything ! kit ? hey , you there ?

looks slow tonight .

i will . i 'm trying . meanwhile i got some crack left , you wan na get high ?

do n't be mad at me . i 'll pay you back . i promise .

do n't give me that . kit gave it to you yesterday , cash .

i also place las chocolates on the pillow .

hi , barney !

i like steak .

then you use your < u > soup spoon < /u > .

actually , some of the richest people i know have the worst manners . of course , mr. harris , being of old money , knows his way around a table . all right now , pay attention please . salad fork .

i think you 'll find it normal enough .

what is it , miss vivian ?

what 's your name ?

i ... edward ...

i was in here yesterday .

i do n't think we have anything for you here . you 're obviously in the wrong place .

excuse me ?

you have beautiful things . how much is this ?

yes . something ... conservative .

yeah . sure . why not . call me at the regent beverly wilshire .

you do n't believe me ?

then i 'm here till i die ?

brides often are , i 'm told .

yes , i am a silly girl , for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear .

yes . yes , of course . naturally , not those four .

ah ! my dulcet darling . tonight we marry . tomorrow morning , your men will escort us to florin channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon .

of course .

may i live a thousand years and never hunt again .

if we surrender , and i return with you , will you promise not to hurt this man ?

i asked him what was so important for him . `` true love , '' he replied . and then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness . i can only assume he meant you . you should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are .

he died well , that should please you . no bribe attempts or blubbering . he simply said , `` please . please , i need to live . '' it was the `` please '' that caught my memory . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 53 .

on the high seas , your ship attacked , and the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners .

i know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything .

you admit to me you do not love your fiance ?

you think your dearest love will save you ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 50 .

well , no , we sort of skipped that part .

it never happened .

what hideous sin have you committed lately ?

i mean , what are the three terrors of the fire swamp ? one , the flame spurts . no problem . there 's a popping sound preceding each , we can avoid that . two , the lightning sand . but you were clever enough to discover what that looks like , so in the future we can avoid that too .

no . no . we have already succeeded .

we 'll never succeed -- we may as well die here .

i myself am often surprised at life 's little quirks . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 59 .

nonsense -- you 're only saying that because no one ever has . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 57 .

of course you will .

well , i have n't fought just one person for so long . i 've been specializing in groups . battling gangs for local charities , that kind of thing .

look are you just fiddling around with me or what ?

it 's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest . i do n't even exercise . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 38 .

we face each other as god intended . sportsmanlike . no tricks , no weapons , skill against skill alone .

i did that on purpose . i do n't have to miss .

oh , good , my way . thank you , vizzini . which way is my way ?

finish him , finish him . your way .

am i going mad or did the word `` think '' escape your lips ? you were not hired for your brains , you hippopotamic land mass .

you never said anything about killing anyone .

who 's guilder ?

i 'll be right back .

right , right , sorry .

will this do ?

tilt his head back . open his mouth .

i have a little .

-- fezzik , please --

do n't bother me with trifles ; after twenty years , at last , my father 's soul will be at peace .

-- look , he bested you with strength , your greatness . he bested me with steel . he must have outthought vizzini , and a man who can do that can plan my castle 's onslaught any day . let 's go --

that leaves twenty for me . at my best , i could never defeat that many . i need vizzini to plan . i have no gift for strategy . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 82 .

i do n't think more than ten .

maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow .

okay .

now i think you ought to go to sleep .

westley 's only faking , right ?

it was ten days till the wedding . the king still lived , but buttercup 's nightmares were growing steadily worse .

i 'm telling you you 're messing up the story , now get it right !

well , maybe i was a little bit concerned . but that 's not the same thing .

i do n't be-leeve this .

-hold it , hold it-

it does n't sound too bad . i 'll try and stay awake .

double it . my princess must be safe .

try ruling the world sometime .

many of the thieves will resist . my regular enforcers will be inadequate .

that may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me .

i give you full marks for bravery -- do n't make yourself a fool .

tyrone , you know how much i love watching you work . but , i 've got my country 's five hundredth anniversary to plan , my wedding to arrange , my wife to murder , and guilder to frame for it . i 'm swamped . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 75 .

now , where is that secret knot ? it 's impossible to find . are you coming down into the pit ? westley 's got his strength back . i am starting him on the machine tonight .

oh , i know . the people are quite taken with her . it 's odd , but when i hired vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day , i thought that was clever . but it 's going to be so much more moving when i strangle her on our wedding night . once guilder is blamed , the nation will be truly outraged . they 'll demand we go to war .

of course .

who won ? how did it end ?

in that case --

where 's fezzik ?

your brains , fezzik 's strength , my steel .

-- offer me money --

true love . you heard him . you could not ask for a more noble cause than that .

now , mostly dead is slightly alive . now , all dead ... well , with all dead , there 's usually only one thing that you can do .

okay .

who are you ? !

i am not left-handed either .

more pursuit than study lately . you see , i can not find him . it 's been twenty years now . i am starting to lose confidence . i just work for vizzini to pay the bills . there 's not a lot of money in revenge .

how old were you ?

do you always begin conversations this way ?

again . thank you .

that 's very comforting . but i 'm afraid you 'll just have to wait .

i could do that . in fact , i 've got some rope up here . but i do not think that you will accept my help , since i am only waiting around to kill you .

look , i do n't mean to be rude , but this is not as easy as it looks . so i 'd appreciate it if you would n't distract me .

slow going ?

he did n't fall ? inconceivable ! !

inconceivable !

stop doing that . we can all relax , it 's almost over-

making sure nobody 's following us .

yes -- australia , and you must have suspected i would have known the powder 's origin , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 46 .

wait till i get going ! where was i ?

you 've made your decision then7

i smell nothing .

i accept .

yes .

you 're that smart ?

i 'm afraid so -- i ca n't compete with you physically . and you 're no match for my brains .

-- there 's nothing to explain . you 're trying to kidnap what i 've rightfully stolen . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 43 .

bye-bye , boys .

a life expiring and you do n't have the decency to say why you wo n't help --

what , humperdinck ? humperdinck . humperdinck . ooo-ooo , humperdinck

you never had it so good . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 95 .

-- get back , witch --

maybe he wo n't .

he 'll pinch my cheek . i hate that .

`` keep a shining in ...

`` honeymoon ,

`` i want to croon ,

do n't help me .

what are you doing ? we 're trapped . it 's either the show or us . there 's no way out . what can we do , blow up the theatre ?

here . buy bullets . kill . kill them all !

double . double . double .

ohhhhhhhhh , how i hate you .

no way out . no way out . what ? who ?

it 's gorgeous . absolutely gorgeous . you could n't have picked a better color . it brings out your eyes . let 's face it , roger , that dress is you .

roger de bris is the worst director that ever lived .

i 'll show you . ulla , go to work .

what are you doing ?

there it is ... in red and white ! `` springtime for hitler , '' signed , sealed and delivered . what 's the matter with you ?

run a week ? are you kidding ? this play has got to close in the first act .

you found a flop !

you bet your boots , leo . it 's bialystock and bloom -- on the rise . upward and onward . say , you 'll join me . nothing can stop us .

coney island ? ?

let me see ... it 's such a beautiful day . why waste it indoors . i 've got it ! let 's go to coney island ! we 'll lunch at the sea shore .

how 's this ?

go away from me . you frighten me . sit over there .

aaaaaaaaaa !

no , bloom , you do n't understand . this is fate , this is destiny . there 's no avoiding it .

oh , no . no . no . i meant no scheme . i merely posed a little , academic accounting theory . it 's just a thought .

oh , you 'd go to jail . if the play were a hit , you 'd have to pay off the backers , and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around , get it ?

ahhhhhh ! but that 's where you made your error . you did n't go all the way . you see , if you were really a bold criminal , you could have raised a million .

what do you mean ?

now let 's see , if we add these figures , we get ...

oh , it 's all right ... wha ?

but that 's cheating !

i went to a turkish bath , who cares ? the show was a flop . what difference does it make ?

according to the backer 's list you raised $ 60,000 . but the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand . there 's two thousand dollars unaccounted for .

shut up . i 'm having a rhetorical conversation . how humiliating . max bialystock . max bialystock .

uh ... uh ... ooooooops ?

ooooooops .

oooooooops !

i ca n't . i ca n't do it . it 's a demon . it 's a gargoyle , it 's a monster ... but it 's still my child .

vhy do you always call me kraut ? kraut is cabbage ! do ve call you hot dogs ? ve call you yanks not franks !

you mean out of business . heh , heh .

it was the same thing in germany . we looked for years before we found the right hitler .

you think out of all those hitlers you could find just one ...

we swear it !

really , i never dreamed ...

no kidding ?

vit the fuhrer , of course . he liked me . out of all the household staff at berchtesgarten , i vas his favorite . i vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime .

you 're not , as you americans say , dragging my leg , are you ?

mr. liebkind , wait . you do n't understand .

no ! no ! we do n't make love . go to work .

we make love ?

get car . get car .

oh . `` i 'm a yankee doodle dandy , yankee doodle is my ... `` listen , this is not place to talk . come !

mr. liebkind , mr. liebkind .

sing a song ! just sing a song !

what do you do best ?

i mean in show business .

lorenzo saint dubois . but everybody calls me lsd .

we are falling back on all fronts . our soldiers are retreating .

groovy !

hey , baby , that 's good ! how 'd we come out ?

he 's the only cat left that still grooves me .

sick old women are sharp . come on , i wo n't disturb ...

i did n't mean that as a slur on your manhood . i 'm sorry .

i 'm not a fool ! and i 'm not capable of being fooled ! not even by women !

if this girl mary crane were here , you 'd have no reason to hide her would you ?

she 's ... ill. confined to her room . it 's practically living alone .

not at all !

i do mind . if it do n't jell , it ai n't aspic ! this ai n't jelling .

and when she left , she never came back .

she was tired . she said she had a long drive ahead of her , in the morning ... yes , now i 'm remembering very clearly because i 'm picturing . when you make a picture of the moment in your mind , you can remember every detail . she was sitting back there , no she was standing up , with some sandwich still in her hand , and she said she had to drive a long way .

how do you know she did n't make a call ?

no .

or arrived with her .

tell me all about her .

look at the picture . please .

committing myself to what ? you sure talk like a policeman .

in the past two days i 've been to so many motels , my eyes are bleary with neon . this is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large .

i do n't believe it . do you ?

must 've needed it .

i do n't care if you do or ... i want to see mary ... before she gets in any deeper ...

i 'll be perfectly honest with you , ma'am . it 's not that i do n't trust you , but ...

i 'd really rather not . please . ca n't we just settle this and ...

i think you 'd better give it a trial spin . do n't want any bad word of mouth about california charlie .

in the building ... mary starts for the building , glancing once in the direction of the patrolman .

of course not . please .

it looks fine . how much will it be , with my car ... ?

can i trade in my car and take another ?

teddy called . me ... and my mother called to see if teddy called . oh , and your sister called to say she 's going to tucson to do some buying and she 'll be gone the whole weekend and ...

you better run out to the house . she may be ... unable to answer the phone ...

buzz me the minute she comes in .

caroline ... ? mary still is n't in ?

yes , mr. lowery .

i still feel ...

your detective told you a nakedfaced lie .

he said he was dissatisfied ... and was going back .

i think something 's wrong , too , miss . but not the same thing . i think your private detective is what 's wrong . i think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going ... probably from norman bates ... and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money .

go out there ! find somebody , ask some questions ! i 'm sorry if i seem over-anxious to you . i keep thinking ... something 's wrong . i have to know what !

a lot ?

why not ?

you ca n't go up there .

sorry .

there must be some proof that exists right now ! something that proves he got that money away from mary ... some way !

i 'm glad we did n't .

we should have asked for cabin one ... the one mary was in .

i believe it .

this is the old highway .

we were going to get married . are going to get married !

she was willing to lick the stamps .

i wonder if we 'll ever see mary again .

this is lila crane , from phoenix . she 's been here for a few days , looking for her sister . there 's a private detective helping ... and , well , we got a call tonight , from this detective , saying he 'd traced mary ...

he 's the deputy sheriff around here .

let 's go see al chambers .

sam , he called me when he had nothing definite , nothing but a dissatisfied feeling . do n't you think he 'd have called if he had anything ...

stay here .

got the number of the motel out on the old highway ? bates , i think .

hundreds ! which one is your pet ?

you have an awfully nice habit , sam .

are we just going to go on sitting here ?

it 's been three .

first rate hotel , fifty yards up the street . come on . after we check you in we 'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich . then we 'll come back here ... and wait .

i did n't see her ... and i did n't hear from her ! believe that !

he must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it ... all that cash ...

you might have doubted for say five minutes or so , sister .

what thing could we be in together ?

what do you know about it ?

what should i know ?

i 'm mary 's sister .

yes ?

hey , we can leave together ca n't we ?

how can you even think a thing like that !

i 'll lick the stamps .

yeah , but when you do ... you 'll swing .

all right .

not even just to see you , to have lunch ... in public ?

no .

can you ?

i 've lost my girlish laughter .

what do i do with my free afternoon , walk you to the airport ?

call your boss and tell him you 're taking the rest of the afternoon off . it 's friday anyway ... and hot .

good night .

that 's it .

an institution ? a madhouse ? people always call a madhouse `` someplace . '' put her in someplace !

where are you going ? i do n't mean to pry ...

it 's a strange hobby . curious , i mean .

you eat like a bird .

no .

the bathroom .

stuffy in here . well ... the mattress is soft and there 're hangers in the closet and ... stationary with `` bates ' motel '' printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious ... and ... the ... over there ... .

dirty night .

please .

please ... i 'd like to go ...

frankly , yes .

we have a problem .

arbogast .

leave me alone !

i do n't know what you 've been saying .

just an expression ... what i meant was ... i 'd do just about anything ... to get away . would n't you ?

yes , matter of fact . the wife 's taking a nap and ... i can never keep quiet enough for her ... so i thought i 'd look you up and ... talk .

i 'll show you the cabin .

i 'll get your bags .

that 's the one that 's got the coroner doing nightwork .

did i ?

said & quot ; doctor & quot ; -- [ something ]

you mean he does n't work for you ?

i understand my husband is -- your assistant . may i see him please ?

hm -- pressure -- to buckley . that 's all right . we 'll talk later .

what made you steal ? are you hungry ?

who are you ? what is your name ?

thousands ?

i understand from your neighbors that all [ them ] cats are making noise at night . dr. meirschultz has put in a complaint .

take me down there .

oh , nothing . a cou- ple of my patients having a little argument .

oh , just the basement . some day i intend to build an experimental laboratory down there . it will save me from intrusion .

oh no . mostly research in endocrinology .

yes indeed . he has been a < u > difficult < /u > case . now that < u > you < /u > have him in custody -- you have him have n't you ?

how do you do .

you 're losing your blood ?

i 'm losing my blood !

that spoke to you ?

what were you dreaming about ?

another fragment of the diary is shown [ having to do with vampires ] .

no -- i did n't . it was igor at the waxworks .

if you 're going to be indiscreet , i wish you 'd be a little more discreet about it . rich men , like winton , love you and leave you .

what 's the rush ? there 's no first act . they 'll all be there and we do n't have to appear at any particular time .

then marry ralph ... you 'll be the happiest couple in the world .

in the can . the hoosegow ! mrs. winton 's little boy . the pawk avenue wintons , you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi . he 's in the jail-house now ...

i just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you did n't have the rent , but ralph is awful sweet .

yes , why ?

are we going to have the same quarrel over again ?

but why ? she 's the best friend i 've got .

and he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you . let him think it was his fault ... he should be along very shortly .. . but be very stern before you forgive him , especially if it is your fault ... while you 're waiting for your friend , would you like to see some new figures i have downstairs ?

no -- i -- wanted to speak to ralph . we had a silly argument last night and i said something unkind .

at any time . you will always be welcome .

nothing doing . this is my percentage . you birds are going to get yours . and anyhow , i found this dump .

it happens that i 'm the law .

whatever you are , you 're the only one of it .

are you giving me this straight ?

the body of joan gale !

i 'm going to get even with you , you dirty stiff ! i 'll do it !

yes , you could . cut out this rotten business and act like a lady . marry me .

i 'm going to make you eat dirt , you soap bubble ! i 'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go !

what goofy idea have you got now ? do n't tell me you suspect judge ramsey of stealing the body .

almost ! i 'll still bet i 'm right , and let you write your own ticket .

almost certain .

let it go .

listen , jo-jo . does this mean anything to you ? joan gale 's body swiped from the morgue -- did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask ?

no kiddin ' . what 's your idea ?

well , no one would ever suspect it . you do n't sound right .

so you can give me an argument and tell me i 'm wrong . do n't be sil , kid .

hey , mattie , dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on joan gale .

great ! ... if he 's worthless we 'll give him away as a bridge prize . come on -- beat it . it 's five o'clock . you need some sleep .

on the square , jimmy , if you 'd seen winton down there -- i 'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he 's a dirty pup , but he 's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...

hey , come here , sob-sister !

i would n't be trying , beloved . i would hang him ! and another thing , all this gaga about the body disappearing . eight bodies have been stolen in new york within the last eighteen months . does n't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle ?

and how does one go about getting these human documents , may i inquire ?

well , is it my fault if nothing happens ?

i 'm through clowning . you 're all washed up . get out !

that you 're a sure bet to place in the bread line . there 's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental . you 're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it .

meaning what ?

been doing experiments with scotch and soda again ?

you used to go to worth 's place a whole lot . what makes you sure it was n't there ?

no , sir , i 'm sure it was n't there .

you did n't happen to be going to worth 's place , did you ?

where were you going when you got in that cab ?

it 's all yours .

do n't give this to anybody else , will you ?

make it snappy , colonel .

why would i string y ' ? they were sweeties until a month ago .

no foolin ' -- any suspect ?

i 've got a story for you . you know the joan gale girl ?

here 's a wow .

i told you he was a sore .

plain-clothes man . come on , slaves , drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to washington ... a fate worse than death .

where 'd you get the stag hound ?

i 'm after news , as usual . i wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory ?

horsefeathers !

nix , flo -- he wo n't let you in and you 'll only get me in dutch .

who ? old santa claus there ? that 's easy for anyone with my sex appeal . he 's a pushover . watch me stand that old dodo on his ear .

gee , honey-bunch , i 'm sorry -- i 'm going to have to disappoint you .

heaven knows . a lot .

you do n't believe me . you think i 'm just talking . will you marry me ?

no , really -- i 'm crazy about you .

darned if i do n't !

why ?

i told you what to do . drive around the corner out of sight of the house . i want to get a closer look at the place .

what ! and let every rag in town grab a red-hot story ? not so you could notice it ! now , look , i want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me .

that 's what they 're going to ask you .

hold on , hold on . i 'm trying to help you , if you 're on the square , and i think you are .

i see . was that all she said ?

she laughed and told me that we were being silly , that we did n't care for each other any more but we need n't hate each other ... ... she said she wanted to be friends .

uh-huh . do you remember what she said ? what did you talk about ?

come on , old man , that wo n't do . you know you 're innocent until proven guilty .

you are too gracious . these things have some merit , i suspect ... but this -- ... i am convinced , is fine .

well , what do you think i 'm in this for ? think of it , man , a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us !

and they are welcome to them . to perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes .

yes , there 's our way out . a fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds .

that is unfortunate .

i came back for some of the books . i am trying to straighten out the accounts . i do n't hope to impress you , but i may as well tell you : we have n't a farthing !

all right , i 'll tell them . they 're right here in front .

that is unfortunate . they will have to wait .

that does n't seem so bad to me . what is wrong with it ?

one of the maids-in-waiting for that elizabethan group .

i wonder if i could have her pose for me .

she is the soul of that statue .

i 'd be glad to , mr. igor . i think i 'll have somethin ' to tell you soon .

well , any time i can do anything for you --

yep . everything settled .

yes ... .

what was her name ?

why ?

wait . i want to tell you something .

i did n't want to leave things the way we did . not this time .

dysfunctional --

like now ?

could be .

at the sub-atomic level , particles obey their own logic . they connect in unimaginable ways .

why am i doing this ?

that 's the physicist 's playground .

could you ?

what ?

i 'm heading out of town .

day or night ?

well , i got to see her .

oh , mother , not the castor oil .

they 're filthy , mother .

what was your mother like ?

yep , we had 'em in orange crates all over . it was daddy 's dream . he was goin ' to get rich raisin ' rabbits . it was what killed daddy . he did n't drown hisself till a long time later after momma and lunette died of typhoid , but it was them rabbits what killed him .

i guess i 'll work as a waitress , buddy . i done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know , but i ca n't stay here no more . why did you get rid of your rabbits , buddy ?

makin ' homes for purple martins , huh ? we had 'em on the farm . they 're the prettiest things . that 's what i wish i was , a bird . just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun .

okay .

yeah , i 'd believe it .

he 's got doubts about hisself and that 's the saddest thing of all . would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him ?

yeah , he tried to hide it but i saw 'em , and a little bit he says to me , `` you know , you are beautiful . '' now was n't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient , was n't it ? what could cheer a girl up more ?

rose , if you do n't keep your boyfriends away from the house , daddy is going to fire you .

well , he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day . but i do n't know who he is , buddy , i really do n't .

rose , you must know who the fellow is .

here comes daddy .

you 're going to get yourself up and go out ?

well , ill tell you this . i have learned a lesson tonight . i was n't gon na run around , but when i start botherin ' your daddy and worse robbin ' a cradle , i got ta face the facts of life . tomorrow mornin ' , i 'm gon na get myself up and go out .

rose , they could stick splinters under my fingernails , and i will never say a word ! i will never tell them , because ... i love you !

rose , are you all right ? are you sick or something ?

i must be outta my mind . buddy , quit it .

buddy , you 're just a child .

please , rose . i 'm curious , that 's all , i have a natural curiosity , it 's only human . you 're my friend , are n't you ? do n't you like me ? i like you , rose , a lot -- in fact , i love you .

rose , since you 're here in bed with me and everything and i 've already touched your titty ...

most men would n't do what he done . if they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- i guess to hell they do , just like a dern rabbit . 'course later they 'll tell her she 's no good when they done the same thing their selves . they 're a bunch of monkeys . i like 'em , but they 're a bunch of monkeys .

well , some fiend might .

buddy , what 's come over you ? a child like you , askin ' such things .

can i put my hand inside your nightgown , rose ?

it 's so terrible i ca n't tell you . oh , buddy , you do n't know how it hurts to have a broken heart , what a terrible feeling it is , and i 've had a broken heart so many times . men , i do n't understand them , i ca n't figure them out and they break my heart , that 's all . i ca n't find mr. right , buddy , i ca n't find him no matter how hard i look , all i find is a whole pile of mr. wrongs . but this is the worst ever because it was n't his fault . it was my fault , oh yes , my fault , i was bad -- oh god , i was bad , you would n't believe how bad i was .

i do n't hear you . i just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away .

oh , waski , you do n't even know what we 're talking about .

rose is madly in love with daddy ...

i do , too !

oh , waski , you do n't even know what we 're talking about .

she 's got somebody in there , brother ! his shoes are on the back porch -- there they were , naked and smiling at me ! rose , open this door immediately !

well . well , what i mean is , you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him . but look this , brother , it is even more interesting . look at this mark here , and that mark over there . now would n't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder ?

that is because it rained recently , the rain has obscured the evidence . but you could still take plaster casts of these footprints , then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are , and that way you could catch him -- understand ?

see that , son ? now this is a heel , see , and there , that 's the ball of a foot . someone has been walking here .

well , yeah .

i 'll be right back .

excuse me , got ta go to bathroom .

oh , yes , it 's thursday . hello , rose , dear ... ... my , you 're ... looking pretty ...

yes , i did , mother . your hearing aid is n't working right . i said ahhh-dam stuff .

no , you did n't say that , brother .

uhhh , gahdam stuff !

oh , brother , i am so disappointed in you . you must n't look at those horrible things , they degrade the human image .

in the kitchen drinking all the ice water in glenville . she walked out here , she did n't go by the hotel .

rose says she 's goin ' to have a baby and she sure looks it , but i do n't think so .

what 's goin ' on ?

buddy ... does rose really ... `` do it '' with all those boys and men ?

then why does she act so dumb ?

wonderful ? he kissed her and played with her titty , and i do n't see anything so great about that . he was probably afraid mother would come back early and catch him .

is that all ?

he kissed her .

what are they doing , doll ?

wow ! brrrother !

yeah .

there goes mother .

i get so irritated with daddy . he 's so dumb sometimes .

daddy says rose is calm as lettuce . do you believe that , doll ?

now look , boy , get a grip on yourself . rose had a good life . she found her . right , did n't she ? she triumphed over everything , what are you blubbering about ?

it 's true , son . the girl with the cornflower eyes is dead , she is no more ,

excuse me , i 'll be right back .

she was fifty-six , son . of course she did n't look it , nowhere near it . the cancer came back , i 'm afraid i fibbed about that . but it was very quick , son . she was in the hospital only two weeks , and the last week she did n't know anything .

dead , rose is dead ? you mean ... she died ?

it always gives me a funny feeling to come home . dear old southland . gone . it 's all gone , daddy -- -- except you , you 're still here .

what sad news ? did her cancer come back ?

of course i recall rose . in fact i 've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half .

good god , the way you live here . this place has n't been dusted since mother died . look at that goddamned refrigerator .

yeah , they 're in the snow .

i have of course observed the girl in treating her .

i am ahead of you .

go ahead , doctor , i think i am following you .

who ?

why , that looks like dave wilkie ,

it 's twenty after one .

better off ? how could she ever find love and happiness , if you did what you 're talking about ? are you insane ?

well , i ... i had n't thought about it that much . i was thinking ... well , it 's an idea , the girl is oversexed , and ...

honey , that 's no way to talk to the doctor , he 's merely doing his job , dear .

she does n't have to take her panties off , we can see her stomach with 'em on . all she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly .

honey !

what did you forget ?

but she must know ... unless ... unless ... rose , was there more than one person ?

i do n't give a hoot in hell 's hollow what it means to her ! she ca n't stay in this house forever ! i fired her , damn it !

no , she does n't , she 's fine , fine . she 's perfectly healthy , do n't give her ideas .

just a moment , dear . we ca n't have it , rose . can you behave yourself -- or not ? that is the question , to behave or not to behave , to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question . if you ca n't behave i am going to fire you and i say it in front of you and mrs. hillyer and i mean it . i point my rigid finger right at your nose , rose , and i stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and i tell you ... this is a final warning . do you hear me ?

she has n't actually done anything ...

i ca n't stand that polecat . they ought to hang him .

if you mean sex , you could n't be more wrong . rose likes those boys and men , she has love in her heart , and that is what they want . it 's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her .

how could rose really be a bad influence on dolly ? she has a loving nature , you ought to want someone like that around your children . why do you think those boys and men like her ?

but what i said is the simple truth . and now i see something else , i see more deeply into it ...

now look , darlin ' , this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension .

but morals come from the heart , not from rigid rules and empty laws . and in her heart rose has never hurt anyone and she never would . therefore , she 's not immoral . not really .

well , that 's very reasonable . howe i hate to bring it up , but she 's got an awful toothache , we 've got to carry her to the dentist .

i said i do n't intend to fire her . i just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth , that 's all .

darlin ' , it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --

rose , i realize you do n't know this boy , but if you know anybody who does know him , if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be , then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife ... and i do n't mean maybe .

forgive my crudity , darlin ' . all i 'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later .

i do n't see any bruises or broken bones .

he and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children .

lay off of that stuff , son . it upsets your mother .

why , they wo n't either . she looks pretty . and i wish you would n't pick on the poor girl all the time . do n't listen to him , rose , you look pretty , even beautiful .

all right , darlin ' .

hotcha character . if i had to live with your cynicism , i would n't want to live at all . what you ca n't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive , not negative .

honey , she 's perfect . she works all the time and she 's wonderful with the children . and they love her , even brother likes her though he wo n't admit it . i think she 's just perfect .

i asked you what you think of rosebud , now that she 's been here a while .

what do you think of her , honey ?

good morning , sweetheart . beautiful day .

well , well , well . so miss rosebud has arrived . un-hmm . and you 're all assembled here . yes , indeed . un hmmm .

it is n't the fourth dimension . to you it 's the fourth dimension , maybe , to me it 's simply the truth .

all right , damn it . we 've seen you with your clothes off around here , stand up and pull up your dress and let 's take a look !

well , rose , going out to look for a job today ?

all right , thanks to her , and thanks to this case of epizootics , you are getting another chance . but do n't try my patience again . we have growing children in this house . do you understand me ?

yes , sir . i had to go to the bathroom .

what have you got in your hair , girl ?

there are more on the other side .

how can the buttons stand the pressure ?

you 're so sweet .

rose , rose , rose , you poor miserable little child , do n't you know i love you ? do i have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it ? you are beautiful to me , rose , i 've loved you since you first came here , darlin ' . and do n't you know mrs. hillyer loves you , too , that she 's already taken you into her heart , and that that woman 's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars ?

calm down , rose , let 's calm down and discuss it ...

ahh-hem ! now , rose , get off my lap . what are you doing , girl ? are you crazy ?

rosebird baby , you are the light of my life , darlin ' . how did we ever get by without you ?

rosebaby blossom , these are the most delicious candied yams i ever ate ! why , they just melt in my mouth . and this fried chicken is fit for a king . how do you do it , peachbird ? what is the secret of your art , plum blossom , huh ?

ah-h , if you happen to run into rose sometime ... do me a favor , give her a message for me , will you ?

yeah , i remember it .

she used to call me mr. right . remember that , buddy ?

dave , you are as full of shit as a christmas turkey and you know it . now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail , go right ahead . but i am telling you , you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs .

oh , it 's all right , beats jew york . but the niggers have took it over , just like every other city we got , only worse .

well , i ... i ... ah-h , let 's see ...

excuse me ... your voice is familiar and i 'm sure i know you from somewhere ...

you must n't be a tattletale , dear . you must n't be delilah-ish and jezebel-ish toward your brother , dear .

i 'm sorry the truth nauseates you , mrs. hillyer , because before you leave there 's a bit more of it i 'd like to put to you . this operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that i feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl , who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well .

no , you should n't have , it was needlessly cruel . she thinks she has cancer and is going to die .

well , that 's pathetic . poor rose , what a life she has had .

do n't worry , madam , she ca n't infect your dear little kiddies . she long ago fully recovered , but the disease did irreparable damage . the girl is permanently barren .

gonorrhea ?

i 'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant . an ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy . but it was pure wishful thinking on her part . the girl can never have children , she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated .

that would scare her to death . she 's terrified of hospitals . to her , a hospital is where you go to die .

yes , and it 's very bad . it probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia .

there are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair . beauty is beauty and that 's all there is to it . beauty is there and we have to recognize it . now rose , the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is doll baby . she looks like an angel and she is an angel , but she can be a naughty angel sometimes , although her father wo n't believe it . her real name is frances , but we call her dolly or doll .

when he was baby we called him `` wa wa , '' a baby name , you know . you will find him a very good boy . his brother can be bad and so can his sister , but waski is a very good boy . and as you can see he 's beautiful .

and who do you suppose he is ? that policeman who arrested me , the one i bit ! he is mr. right !

i do n't mind .

rose , really , you should n't act like that .

well , you 're real sweet to make it for me . there never was nobody like you . and you do n't need to worry , i ai n't goin ' out no more .

no more dentists , no more dentists ...

i know it was bad , honey . i 'm sorry ...

ohh-hh , a little . oh-h , i ai n't never been to no dentist before . he 's gon na kill me , i just know it .

rose , that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again .

no , ma'am , i 'm just fine .

i like to work . i do n't mind work . it 's the least i can do after all you and mr. hillyer have done for me . you 're so sweet . there never was nobody like you .

more history , rose .

maybe i 'm not making myself clear . you 're probably the first girl billy-boy 's ever fallen in love with , and i know for sure you 're the first he 's slept with . so , how 's he gon na feel ... ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who did n't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up ?

i 'm looking at this poster , and i 'm thinkin ' , i do n't remember seeing films like this when i was in school .

i ... i can explain ...

come on , do n't you screw with her , please ! you ... you got to want this : armored car job . caltrust bank . they took two million in cash ...

alright , wait ... there 's a dentist in brentwood peddling morphine ...

cuff'em . let 's see what these two love birds say once they 're sitting in separate cages .

okay , man , okay . i 'm with you . i ... i heard how the shit 's arriving ... it 's coming in a lincoln .

you get nothing and like it . and if we 're not blissfully happy with what you tell us , we arrest you just for the fun of it .

indivisible and inseparable .

what ... ?

three hundred kilos of white lady hidden inside a giant bust of abraham lincoln . a parade float .

you 're zimmermann 's calculator , archie . all the blood money you had to move around to make this deal , you got to know something . maybe they told you , maybe you overheard things you were n't supposed to hear ...

this is private property . this is breaking and entering !

again .

you do n't smoke .

feeling great .

where we going ?

name one .

wh ... what ... ? !

remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time ... ?

lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes . it 's a tax dodge .

it 's personal . we 'll hook up at billy-boy 's pad in an hour . see ya then .

who 's that ? zimmermann 's money-man ?

we shoulda been there to back you up . we shoulda !

what of it ? have n't we waited forever ... ? have n't we , honey ? have n't we waited long enough to get this scumbag ?

no you ca n't .

we catch 'em , i wan na be first to hurt 'em . promise me i get to go first .

what do you want me to do about it ?

save it . just go .

what , am i supposed to read it while i drive ? keep a grip on it , alright ?

we 've got the tape to prove it .

there probably is .

go wherever you want . live how you want .

what can i say to that ... except , i love you too , you mean-spirited bitch .

general jim beam , then .

i 'm waiting till the time 's right .

this is the police lock-up . we 're police . how can we steal from ourselves ?

no , we 're stealing .

follow me .

you 'll cry like a great big , blubbering baby .

it 's go time , billy-b .

forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers

what 's mine say ?

oh ... okay .

you know , the more weight back there , the faster the car goes .

it 's not gon na happen .

there was a time when you did things the right way , till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister .

what happened , kittle ? we used to be friends . you used to know how the game was played .

our resignations .

i 'm here . that 's all that counts . watch ... you 'll enjoy this ... it 's like magic ...

not like this . are you even listening ?

do n't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor independence day , and do n't tell me i 'm overreacting when i 'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city !

i insist . what will it be ? boston tea party clam chowder , or maybe the chicken red , white and cordon bleu ? no ... there 's a special on the menu , today only ... ... < u > roasted < /u > < u > pig < /u > .

thanks , but we do n't recognize `` brunch '' as an actual meal .

you bust some small-time pimps , whores and dime-bag junkies , like the world 's a better place because you 're in it . and for what , kittle ... two hundred and fifty dollars a week ? tell me , how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent ?

what can we do for you , officers ? what new , mindless harassments have you planned this morning ?

the gang 's all here !

why the beach ?

billy ! billy !

this much powder you do n't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it . it 's got to be smuggled .

seatbelts fastened , please .

what the hell 's his problem ?

your wish is my command .

how 'd we do ?

been waiting long ?

dead .

out here . on your knees .

let 's get this thing done .

whatever goes bang .

that 's not true .

i kinda already figured that , but keep those helpful hints coming .

no , we are < u > not < /u > going to do that .

no you 're not .

let 's hope .

absolutely .

second of all , the declaration of independence was all for liberty and equality , but it did n't do anything about slavery , did it ?

first of all , the constitution was n't writtem till 1787 ...

look out ! jupiter and saturn 'll get you every fucking time .

the way zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling `` escort service '' of yours , i figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight .

yeah ? so , what do you want to ask today that i ca n't answer ? i 'm a busy man .

where 's your pet gorilla and the female uncle tom ?

so are you , pop-sweet . that 's why ...

we 're on our way . red group , gold group , all fighters follow me . told you they 'd do it !

admiral , we 're in position . all fighters accounted for .

she has n't been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have , luke ... but the force is strong with her , as it is with all of your family . there is no avoiding the battle . you must face and destroy vader !

oh , no , my young jedi . you will find that it is you who are mistaken ... about a great many things .

a small rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on endor .

it is of no concern . soon the rebellion will be crushed and young skywalker will be one of us ! your work here is finished , my friend . go out to the command ship and await my orders .

as you wish .

yes , my master .

you have done well , lord vader . and now i sense you wish to continue your search for young skywalker .

han , do n't . it 'll be all right .

nice work . great , chewie ! great ! always thinking with your stomach .

we got separated .

i thought she was with you .

yeah , she 's comin ' up .

i think my eyes are getting better . instead of a big dark blur , i see a big light blur .

how are we doing ?

are you all right ?

here 's the terminal .

hold me .

it 'll take time . this whole party 'll be for nothing if they see us .

shall we try and go around ?

i do n't know . all i can see is a lot of blowing sand !

look . i want you to take her . i mean it . take her . you need all the help you can get . she 's the fastest ship in the fleet .

lando !

we 're coming !

good , i hate long waits .

we shall double our efforts .

there it is !

now lock onto the strongest power source . it should be the power generator .

here goes nothing .

ugh !

no , you do n't . you 've always been strong .

yes . it 's you leia .

you 're wrong , leia . you have that power too . in time you 'll learn to use it as i have . the force is strong in my family . my father has it ... i have it ... and ... my sister has it .

i have no memory of my mother . i never knew her .

tell me .

you can not hide forever , luke .

you could n't bring yourself to kill me before , and i do n't believe you 'll destroy me now .

if that is your destiny .

obi-wan once thought as you do .

come with me .

remember , a jedi 's strength flows from the force . but beware . anger , fear , aggression . the dark side are they . once you start down the dark path , forever will it dominate your destiny .

well , i 'm sorry .

unfortunate that i know the truth ?

no more training do you require . already know you that which you need .

strong am i with the force ... but not that strong ! twilight is upon me and soon night must fall . that is the way of things ... the way of the force .

i told you , my car broke down .

you promise you wo n't tell ?

like this . like how ? it 's your fault - you 're to blame . i thought it was the real thing .

why you - what have you done with janet ?

janet

made me give you the eye and then panic ,

janet ! oh ! yes it 's alright . janet . everything 's going to be alright .

oh , i hope so my darling . but let me switch on the light .

brad ...

we 'll just say where we are then go back to the car we do n't want to be any worry .

right !

brad - i 'm cold , i 'm wet , and plain scared .

they 're probably foreigners with ways different from our own . - they may do some more folk dancing .

well i want to leave .

oh , it 's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos .

oh brad , i 'm frightened . what kind of place is this ?

yes .

just a moment , janet . they may have a telephone .

gosh . that 's the third motorcyclist that 's passed us . they certainly take their lives in their hands . what with the weather and all .

for you .

oh brad .

i really loved the skilful way you beat the other girls to the bride 's bouquet .

yes .

yes .

makes you cry

what guy

nothing . why , do you think i should ?

you beast , you monster , what have you done with brad ?

i did n't make him for you

goodbye

`` sweet transvestite ''

the master is not yet married . nor do i think he ever will be . we are simply his servants .

oh , lucky him .

no . you 've arrived on a rather special night . it 's one of the master 's affairs .

are you - giving a party ?

and our world will do the time warp again .

creature of the night .

do n't say that .

oh , rocky -- you worked so hard .

apollo ?

what did you say about a pet shop ?

yeah ... threw my whole day off .

... and he called the reporters --

yeah ... but i think weak legs ai n't bad sometimes , y'know .

ca n't fool around -- you look very great .

adrian , you really look great , y'know -- but i ca n't fool around durin ' trainin ' -- makes the legs weak .

do n't you open them anymore ?

y'know how i said that stuff on television did n't bother me ?

absolutely -- what time should i expect you ?

how 'd ya like hearin ' ya name on tv ?

could ya take off that hat .

they 're all the same .

no , i do n't belong here .

what 's the problem ? you do n't like me -- do n't like the turtles -- what is it ?

i sold them to you .

after a rough fight , ya ' nothin ' but a large wound . sometimes i feel like callin ' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom ... ya ' eyes hurt , ya ' ears hurt , ya ' hair even hurts ... but the thing i 'm proud of is i been in over sixty fights an ' never had a busted nose -- bent an ' twisted an ' bitten but never broke ... that 's rare .

... it is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter .

some people think bein ' shy is a disease , but it do n't bother me .

i would say you 're very shy by nature .

i just dislocated my finger .

... goodnight , rocky .

what ? !

you busted ? !

you owe me an ' are supposed to treat me good !

... paulie . stop now !

oh , rocky !

paulie , please --

cover the ribs -- look here , elbow down , tight -- tight -- stand straight -- you 're the best , you 're the best !

no doctor ! ... i 'm feelin ' good , bro !

you 're hurtin ' , man !

man , i rearranged his face with that right -- the people love what 's happenin ' tonight .

i do n't like you messin ' with southpaws -- they do everything wrong .

... i do n't feel heat from the name .

you 's the novelty , champ !

'the italian stallion ' -- he 's my man .

... still do n't feel no heat .

how 'bout this big chuck smith ?

fouls .

apollo , i 'm sure there 's a way to salvage this .

shaw 's fighting in south america -- why not postpone the bout until july fourth ?

then gim me buddy shaw -- he 's ranked fifth .

any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls ?

where 're you off to now ?

i do n't like ya face .

we 'll kill you , man -- we got ta gun .

buy us some thunderbird , man .

... no wine -- bad for ya ' brain .

that 's ten bucks .

here -- three minutes .

it ai n't your fault -- i originally done it in the baby crenshaw fight . that 's me fightin ' big baby crenshaw -- big baby was the size of an airplane an ' i broke my hands on his head -- i lost , but it 's a nice picture , do n't ya think ?

hey , whatta ya doin ' here -- we 're closed ... yo , we 're closed !

no way -- but the brilliant ability of the champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks rocky . creed on the offensive -- balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart ... that hurt .

there 's no way apollo expected this kind of hitting power .

apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations . balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on creed 's temple -- not much movement from balboa , duck a left , a right , another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- i mean explodes . the champ backs off .

thank you , bob . the electricity is everywhere tonight . rocky balboa , a fifty-to-one underdog , is living a cinderella story which has captured peoples ' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine , 'the fighting style should be 'the caveman against the cavalier . ' from the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring ... his record is forty-four wins , twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts .

you can forget about sparring , kid .

ya still light seventy .

i know the juice is climbin ' -- i been workin ' six months just to pay the damn interest .

that 's it ? -- completely ?

please , i need my hands to work -- christ , do n't bust my thumbs .

do n't hit the face ! not the face ! !

where else am i gon na go . bet three grand on rocky .

sure , you do what ya want . stay away from the stock market .

gon na try .

here 's fifty bucks -- you an ' the girl have a nice time .

buddy 's got a thing against ya , rock . some people just hate for no reason , y'know .

no , two yards from snyder , an ' a grand from cappoli .

next wednesday i grab a grand from snyder . an ' thursday two yards from cappoli , okay ?

i figure if i break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and ca n't pay nothin ' no more .

yo rock . did i give you a job this mornin ? how come ya did n't break this guy 's thumb like i asked ya ? when ya do n't do what ya are told , it makes me look bad , kid .

sure , an ' i 'm smart enough to know that no sparrin ' partner should take cheap shots at the champ . he 's just there to help condition the man .

did you hear what i said ?

i would n't take no cheap shots . i 'd be a good sparrin ' partner .

absolutely -- sparrin ' with the champ would be an honor -- y'know what ?

i 'm sure you are .

excuse me .

no -- just me .

rocky , do you have any representation ? a manager ?

rocky .

ya hope i do n't keep acting like a whore or i 'll turn into one , right ?

i like yella teeth .

make your teeth yella --

... yeah .

stuff it , man !

hey --

... yeah .

how you holdin ' up , kid ?

whatta ya think that outfit cost ?

do n't let 'im get you tight .

whatta you get outta this ?

do n't you care what the people will say ?

yo , benny .

what cha say , benny -- meet 'the rock . ' this is our cutman , benny stein .

i never had good footwork .

i 'm sorry , i -- i made a mistake . kid , i 'm askin ' man to man . i wan na be ya manager .

heart , but i ai n't got no tocker .

yeah , ya kinda remind me of the rock . ya move like 'im .

turtles -- domestic turtles .

i 'm usta seein ' ya at the gym , but seein ' ya here , in my house , it 's kinda outta joint .

best seat in the house -- hey , mick , this is too much .

hey , mickey -- whatta ya doin ' here ? here , sit down .

i seen the light . i figure somebody was home .

when was they here ?

here 's the card ?

ya puttin ' me on ?

yeah , sure .

you think everybody i fight is a bum .

rice is a bum .

... who 'd ya fight ?

... did ya fight last night ?

yeah , they 're goin ' , -- that 's nature ... that was my locker for six years .

how old are ya ?

... tomato ?

dipper 's a climber -- you 're a tomato .

whatta ya talkin ' about it ai n't my locker no more ?

it ai n't your locker no more .

... what kinda dog is this again ?

how 's butkus this mornin ' ?

... it 's cold outside , paulie .

outta my house i want ya ! !

to see ya train .

what 's the attraction ? i do n't see it ?

keep this job , ya eat better .

how 'bout you talk to 'em about me ? please do me that favor .

... tight .

how ya feelin ' ?

hey , who cared about me yesterday , huh ? nobody -- i think i 'm gon na train myself .

forget nothin ' -- here , talk to my sister , tell 'er somethin ' nice .

i 'm askin ' ya to go to him -- as a favor .

maybe ya should see a doctor .

ya caught me in a bad mood .

every mornin ' , every night i pass by -- i smile . i say jokes . nothin ' . she looks at me .

derogatory ? yeah , he 's great .

do you have anything derogatory to say about the champion ?

do you feel you have a chance ?

how 're you preparing for this bicentennial bout ?

well , i 'll be ...

yeah ...

we do n't serve formula . snookums .

my problem is i come here to drink in peace . so if you do n't mind ...

make it dry . baby does n't like to be wet . you 're valiant , right ? the name 's baby herman .

sounds like you ve never seen her , eddie .

wish i could say the same . what 're you doin ' here , betty ?

i 'm not worried about you . i 'm worried about the safe .

i 've already dropped it on you twenty-three times .

that 'll work out just fine . when this thing is over , i 'll take you to catalina . how does that sound ?

yeah ... they closed me down for a coupla weeks .

are you gon na call him , eddie ?

i 'll bet .

what the hell would they want with a gag factory ?

the rabbit 's wife ? wan na tell me what she was doin ' with her arms around you ?

eddie , you still got it . hey , tomorrow maybe i 'll go down to probate court and see who 's sniffin ' around acme 's estate ?

then why 'd they bother to crack the safe ? you can drop a mosler 90 from mount baldy and it wo n't open .

so what 's the scam , eddie ?

it 's all yours .

oh , yeah ? well , you 're not handcuffed to him . anybody in the back room ?

dolores , meet roger rabbit .

so you 're not even gon na bother to find out if the rabbit 's gettin ' framed ?

stick to stuffin ' the olives , willya , dolores ?

thanks for the vote of confidence .

bastards put him on notice .

no kiddin ' ? bought the red cars , huh ?

this is fifty bucks . i need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow .

that 's right , me .

not really . only a toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea .

surprised ?

that 's what this is all about ? tell me , who 's gon na use your lousy freeway ? we got the red cars , the best public transportation in the country .

a freeway , mr. valiant , is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from l.a. to pasadena . pasadena to hollywood . hollywood to santa monica . someday everyone will be in cars driving happily , non-stop from one end of the l.a. basin to another .

what the hell 's a freeway ?

right here where we 're standing , will be the cornerstone of my idea ... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways .

i 've had enough of your insolence ! put him in my car . i think they 'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the acme factory .

the pot 's callin ' the kettle maniacal .

indeed we are . we 'll continue the interrogation there .

he had a will , all right . she took it off acme the night she and r.k. maroon knocked him off . then she set up her loving husband to take the fall .

being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective . what were you looking for , mr. valiant ?

yes , i find that weasles have a special gift for the work . the rabbit did n't contact you by any chance , did he ?

no ...

earl ... it 's me , valiant .

here 's one for the books ... a toon wearin ' human clothes .

eddie , come on .

hold on a second .

how did you get onto doom ?

he 's right here in the ...

why did n't you tell me ?

that 's not roger . it 's one of doom 's men . he killed r.k. maroon .

oh , sure . i can just feature you standin ' outside your little hutch , holdin ' a carrot cake waitin ' for hubby to come home .

no , no , no ... i love my husband .

toons are n't given imperfections .

oh ... well , i ... i just had to see you .

hello , mr. valiant . i rang the doorbell , but i guess you could n't hear it .

what the hell is that ?

just have n't been this close to toontown for awhile .

you got the will in there , do n't ya ?

no , you got ta understand , valiant , i had nothin ' to do with acme gettin ' killed . i just wanted to sell my studio . but they would n't buy my property unless acme would sell his . and he would n't . so i was gon na blackmail acme with pictures of him and the rabbit 's wife .

well , everybody needs a hobby .

you 're not too good at this , are you , r.k. ?

stop what ?

maybe . why ?

as soon as is humanly possible .

are n't you the lucky one ...

i got him on loan from disney .

nah , that goes with the territory . he 's a stunt bunny .

how much do you know about show business , valiant ?

from this box here ...

pretty good cigar . where 'd you get it ?

no , kid , you 're a real hero .

that 's because it 's disappearing-reappearing ink . shows up three days later . gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he does n't punch you in the nose . great gag .

if i do n't make it back here by ten ...

two bits .

forget it .

that 's why i 'll be there at 8:45 .

no , it 's not .

get away from there .

safe ?

me .

say , who 's this guy laughin ' ?

so what 's our plan , our scenario , our modus operandi ?

but , eddie , you know what happens when ...

hey , does n't the rabbit even get a last request ?

why , you crazy toon ... i 've been out there riskin ' my neck for you . i come back here and you 're singin ' and dancin ' .

yeah . except they screwed up . i do n't think they got the will .

yeah . i think maroon plays the part of the sound mind , your wife the sound body .

are you always this funny , or only on days when you 're wanted for murder ?

gee , eddie , i 'm a rabbit . we always run .

well , i asked the newsboy on the corner . he did n't know . then i asked a janitor , the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way . he was very helpful .

so i hear . even talkin ' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting .

baker 's man ... but no use ruinin ' a good pair of shoes over it .

do you bite your thumb at us ? sir .

i do bite my thumb , sir !

then i defy you , stars ! juliet ! juliet ! i will hence tonight .

either withdraw unto some private place , or reason coldly of your grievences , or else depart . here all eyes gaze on us .

nay , he will answer the letter 's master , how he dares , being dared .

romeo will answer it ?

art thou hurt ?

but 't is no wit to go .

well , in that hit you miss : she 'll not be hit with cupid 's arrow ; nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes , nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold :

a right fair mark , fair cuz , is soonest hit .

alas , that love , so gentle in his view , should be so tyrannous and rough in proof !

in love ?

is the day so young ?

young romeo is it ?

what dares the slave come hither , to fleer and scorn at our solemnity ? now , by the stock and honour of my kin , to strike him dead , i hold it not a sin .

what if this mixture do not work at all ? shall i be married then tomorrow morning ?

are you at leisure holy father , now ? or shall i come to you at evening mass ?

as the custom is , in all her best array , bear her to church .

farewell .

hie you make haste ! but look thou stay not till the watch be set , for then thou canst not pass to mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage , reconcile your friends , beg pardon of the prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy , than thou wentst forth in lamentation . quick hence ! be gone by break of day ! sojourn in mantua .

i pray thee , chde me not ; whom i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow ; the other did not so .

good marrow , father !

farewell . god knows when we shall meet again .

talk not to me , for ill not speak a word . do as thou wilt for i have done with thee .

o sweet my mother cast me not away . delay this marriage for a month , a week . or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies .

madam , in happy time what day is that ?

amen

here 's such a coil ! come , what says romeo ?

your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , i warrant , a virtuous , -- where is your mother ?

by and by , i come : -- to cease thy strief , and leave me to my grief : to-morrow will i send .

i uh , by and by i come -- but if thou mean'st not well , i do beseech thee --

o god , i have an ill-divining soul . methinks i see thee , now thou art so low , as one dead in the bottom of a tomb . o fortune , fortune . be fickle , fortune , for then i hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back .

mercutio 's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company !

i gave thee mine before thou didst request it !

what satisfaction canst thou have to-night ?

do not swear : although i joy in thee , i have no joy of this contract to-night : it is too rash , too unadvised , too sudden ; too like the lightning , which doth cease to be ere one can say 'it lightens . ' sweet , good night ! this bud of love , by summer 's ripening breath , may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet . good night .

if my heart 's dear love --

i have night 's cloak to hide me from their eyes , and but thou love me , let them find me here : my life were better ended by their hate , than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .

neither , fair maid , if either thee dislike .

i take thee at thy word .

she speaks : o , speak again , bright angel !

you kiss by the book .

saints do not move , though grant for prayers ' sake .

ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .

have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?

good pilgrim , you do wrong your hand too much , which mannerly devotion shows in this ; for saints have hands that pilgrims ' hands do touch , and palm to palm is holy palmers ' kiss .

go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .

speak briefly , can you like of paris ' love ?

this night you shall behold him at our feast ; read o'er the volume of young paris ' face , and find delight writ there with beauty 's pen ; this precious book of love , this unbound lover , to beautify him , only lacks a cover : so shall you share all that he doth possess , by having him , making yourself no less .

nay , he 's a flower ; in faith , a very flower .

farewell , ancient lady ; farewell ,

i will follow you .

nay , i am the very pink of courtesy .

a most courteous exposition .

meaning , to court'sy .

away , begone ; the sport is at the best .

peace , good mercutio , peace ! thou talk'st of nothing .

o , then , i see queen mab hath been with you . she is the fairies ' midwife , and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate-stone on the fore-finger of an alderman , drawn with a team of little atomies over men 's noses as they lie asleep ; her chariot is an empty hazel-nut her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat , and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers ' brains , and then they dream of love ; o'er lawyers ' fingers , who straight dream on fees , sometime she driveth o'er a soldier 's neck , and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats , and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again . this is the hag , when maids lie on their backs , that presses them and learns them first to bear , making them women of good carriage : this is she -- this is she !

in bed asleep , while they do dream things true .

too great oppression for a tender thing .

what wouldst thou have with me ?

could you not take some occasion without giving ?

follow me close . gentlemen , gooday . a word with one of you ?

sir . ah , sir . death the end of all

nurse .

if ye should lead her into a fool 's paradise , as they say , it were a very gross kind of behavior , as they say : for the lady is young ; and , therefore , if you should deal double with her , truly it were an ill thing , and very weak dealing .

madam , your mother craves a word with you . come lets away .

do you really think so ?

always in a rush , you are . all these years i 've known you , you could never wait for anything .

i 'm up for that ...

so where do you go from here ?

only the stupid ones . cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets . besides , i 'm not ira no more .

finding this package is a thing easier said than done . we do n't even know what it is . what did we steal ?

leaving ...

while sam and i take out the back two cars ...

of course .

coordinate all you want , but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me . are we in sync on this , vincent ?

best beer in the world known to man or god .

what is ?

i drive -- and my name is larry . larry from the states .

plastic fucking surgeon ? you think i 'm going to fix this , deirdre lass ? it 's the mark of the patriot , and i 'll wear it like a badge . as for those who done it to me , i 'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over .

good christ ! ca n't you lose these jokers ?

not yet ...

about time !

that 's him .

nothing .

it 's been known to happen .

alright ? it 's bloody fucking freezing in here !

i do n't know ... well i do n't ! it 's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you . but i do know who we 're working for . my people , and the russian mob .

i did n't think to see you again tonight . you were pretty pissed .

go ahead , shoot ... shoot and kill the bitch , i do n't care . and yet you do n't shoot . interesting . put down your weapon and walk away .

should any of you decide to rush me , i 'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time .

but would you stake your life , that 's the question ...

i 'd stake my reputation .

i intend to . this phone is wired like no other : it 's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition , it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand . with my custom hardware and this phone i can trace the target 's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes ...

good , because it cost enough . there 's cheaper phones by far than that one , man : you better fucking use it .

i 'm sure . but i 'm sorry to say that it 's too late for trust : we have a serious problem .

where 's my information ?

what 's that ?

here 's yours .

we 'll die if we stay here !

no , mikhi , i would n't . since i wo n't speak your language , and you ca n't speak mine , english will do nicely .

so , you 've got it all figured , do you ?

what am i doing here ? why , i 'm here to see my partners , gregor , the boys in the russian mafia . see , your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross . but they only just found out that what 's in the briefcase is completely useless without me . i ca n't fight them , and they ca n't kill me -- that means we 're gon na have to do business together .

then where is it ?

so none of us knows who 's paying the freight , this is just some anonymous job . for all we know , we 're working for different people .

i got this gig through a contractor . and he most definitely did n't know who was doing the hiring , only that they were paying a lot of money ...

so what do we do ?

i 'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me !

is it done ?

that 's it .

i would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the american .

yes , sam 's tough alright .

you suffered through an agonizing pain last night , pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law .

forgive my intrusion into your affairs , but i am the one who connected vincent to this job , his agent , if you will . he is one of my oldest friends and i owe him a great debt , much like the debt i suspect he owes you .

something important ? a thing that can not wait ?

you should really let a doctor look at that .

some , thanks . enough to move on , for now .

american .

did he bring that with him ?

yeah , well ... my way works too .

it 's been known to happen .

anybody tries to unpleasant me i 'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes .

i do n't particularly like killing , tubby , but i want you to know that this one i 'm going to enjoy .

is that right ?

i ride with fat-boy ...

who 's they ?

i got a surprise for you , blondie ...

what 're you talking about , man ? i do n't understand .

i guess that 's for the best .

gone . destroyed .

i do n't know . nobody knows , except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us . there 's probably a couple of guys back at the company who know , but i do n't think they plan to tell me anytime soon .

what of it ?

what ?

no , i do n't .

the mark of a true samurai . what i do for the company , vincent , is no different than what you do . we 're both hired guns , and this is a job -- like any other job .

what of it ? samurai pain in the ass .

not just like that ... just before i turn around and it 's six months from now and the first thing i do when i wake up in the morning is light a cigarette .

just like that ?

you do n't know ? bullshit , you had her , there was no way out .

they do n't have the package .

i would have tried not to . but yes , if it would have kept him from shooting you , i would have .

i know . jean-pierre did .

not very zen of you , huh ? not so much the modern samurai after all .

you sure your friend got the right place ?

the address of the russian production company . just in case we need to find them .

what 's this ?

yes .

you do n't have to do this .

and what job is that ?

fix it yourself ? why are we even doing this ? there 's no need to run , christ ... you 're a cop .

no hospitals . i 'll fix this myself if i have to .

you know one around here ? somebody you trust ?

it 's paris . the route 's too indirect for anything else . a guy like gregor , he does n't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place . otherwise , he 'd be out of the country by now . he 's going to paris . now i just hope we can find him before he gets there .

you were smoking ?

i came up here to sneak a smoke .

gregor 's cell phone ...

know what ?

i needed to know .

they 'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in new york , and it would still get fucked up .

they certainly are . whatever it is we 're going to steal , it must be quite something .

i 've wondered that myself . none of this answers my question , though ... why bring me ?

deirdre ? smart , yeah , and seriously goddamned dangerous .

like larry or swede .

so , vincent : why bring me along for the ride ? job like this calls for a warm body , somebody who can stand around and look threatening . a tough guy .

there is that .

a cigarette ? as in one ? one cigarette a week , who smokes like that ?

what 's the difference ?

and i suppose he 's saying that we oughta give them something for using it , huh ?

that 's what i thought .

pretty much what you 'd expect .

to see a man about a thing .

coordinate what ?

perhaps the police ?

seamus reilly .

it 's the irish tape we want .

why 's that ?

you sure ?

you slept with the fucker ! !

i got ta try and overcharge him , he has to moan about the price , we settle somewhere in the middle .

seamus reilly , boy 's a serious irish auteur -- a real firebrand . thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies , if you see what i 'm saying .

i 'm alright . and you ?

damn .

looks like some kind of drug deal or something , they 're not from around here -- one of them 's still alive .

uh huh .

just one more . this one knocks off all the rest .

you 're the one who 's nuts ! there 's no one left to touch us , booth . we 're home free ! we just plant a little of the money on dwayne , and it 's all ours .

we got to get out of here . do you understand ? we got to get out of here right now !

no we 're not .

it was all used . random numbers . how can they trace it ?

you do n't know if he was really gon na --

even if we have the tape , that would n't shut him up !

there it is ... now what about the others ?

well what are we supposed to do ?

look , earl . we got ta go straight . this is all messed up ...

no .

yeah , i mean you 're coming unglued , jesse .

you 're out of your mind .

for christ 's sake , booth , i just needed to take care of a few debts is all ! you got my word on it -- i 'm not going near it again until everything cools down .

we had a deal ! what was i , talking to the wall ?

he 's a partner now , earl , like it or not .

he 's going to be trouble .

he 's probably made copies . he 's not going to give them up to us .

exactly . this is our little secret , partner .

he would have done it to us , right ?

what are you thinking ?

shit ! we 're gon na have to get rid of him . i 'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life . we ca n't risk it .

well , we did n't know that at the time .

that guy was a federal agent . an officer of the law , just like us .

i do n't want to hear about miracles and god and all that ! we tried to murder someone to cover our asses !

i tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --

okay then . i 'll do it .

i ... i ca n't do that .

well neither have i , but it 's us or him . if he talks , or writes a note , or whatever , he 's gon na turn us in . besides , he 's a low life scumbag . his kind is hardly even human anyway .

what are you thinking ?

how long you been lying there playing possum with us , huh ? answer me !

we 're going to be patient . if we start flashing money around , buying fancy cars and fancy clothes , people are going to ask questions .

i do . it 's little shit like that sends people to jail ! we have to cover all the bases if we 're going to pull this !

it 's no accident we stumbled on this money . it 's an answer to a prayer ! every night and every day i 've prayed that god would just -- help me out a little , give me a little push . tonight my prayer came true .

i told trudy we were coming down this way , that 's why !

look around you partner ! you said yourself you never saw anything like it .

what do you mean what are we going to do ?

what are we going to do ?

cash and what ?

he would have won more but he blew it at the end . did n't know what cash and carry was .

seven thousand ...

yeah ... i remember my brother-in-law gary , the wheel watcher . he finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars ! plus some leather furniture . do you think i saw any of that ? his excuse was the government got it all .

well i hope so . that pretty much cleaned me out .

ready to roll , partner ?

whoa , earl !

you better believe it if you know what 's good for you !

no . it 's not .

i want my share . all of it .

there 's going to have to be a change in our arrangement .

i 'm all ears .

besides , i 'm not stupid , earl . the tape was a basic maxell d-80 . you can buy 'em at any store . there 's no way they can pin anything on me .

listen earl . i covered for you . for both of you . i put my ass on the line to save yours , so do n't pull a hostile tone with me !

you gentlemen look like you 're about to toss your collective cookies .

it 's odd . i do n't know how denning had the time , or the ability to buy something local , based on his situation .

yeah ? so ?

yes . wife and a kid . do n't blame yourself , deputy . you did all you could . you have our deepest gratitude ... and my personal thanks .

thank you . now , do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site , on your way to or from ?

sally , do you love me ?

i do n't know . my friends ...

should n't be long . a couple of weeks maybe .

when do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out ?

i 'll be there for you . he wo n't try anything while i 'm there . i promise . i 'll protect you .

i 'm going to quit . that 's what has to happen first . then we 're going to tell him .

let 's just get out of here , get out of this -- place . we 'll drop out , get a house have some kids , get a satellite dish ...

it does n't matter ... he 's next to you . you know , i always say to myself , you should have left him years ago . why did n't you ?

he does n't slobber , he just snores . and i told you we have n't ... done anything in over a year .

let 's hope so . sally if he asks me again , i 'm gon na tell him i returned it all .

he started digging through my closet , something he never does .

well , i ca n't let you down now , can i ?

dwayne got a little tipsy is all . he does n't handle pressure well . it 's over .

you deserve it is the occasion .

you got me something ? what 's the occasion ?

yeah i 'm fine .

nothing 's wrong .

i might have to look into that ...

yeah but i need to take out four hundred dollars and the atm will only give me three .

i have to go to the bank before it closes .

yeah , i 've seen him .

what ?

sounds like you do n't trust me .

yeah .

this just might be our ticket !

speaking of which that reminds me i have to bring something home or eat sally 's meatloaf again , and i do n't think i could stand that .

yeah . i told him i 'd be there before five .

not exactly . it 's some lingerie store on the strip .

so there was money there ! who the hell 's money is it ? !

oh yeah . between here and vegas we get a lot of customers . all types . even had an officer , just like you .

oh , that 's ok , a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here .

i 'm just not very good ... with all of this stuff .

yeah i 'd say c ... c .

c ?

uh ... c ?

let 's see ... do you know her cup size ?

we are having a sale on some items over here --

anything ... specific ?

anything i can help you with ?

well i 'm here now .

nice of you to join us . i did say three o'clock , did n't i ?

uh , sure . i hear you .

about what ?

vegas ! can you hightail it back here by three o'clock ?

do you even have a girlfriend , jesse ?

take it or leave it .

dammit youre persistent . i dont want to listen to this anymore . no more bets with you .

no . but what i would like is the forty dollars you owe me , and im a busy man .

you 'd do this to me !

shut up ! ! ! slut ! ! !

it certainly is ...

no , dwayne , you go ahead and relax , have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the tv , and come upstairs and pass out . and do it all over again tomorrow !

look i worked all day , i 'm tired as hell and i want to sit and eat in peace ! is that asking too much ?

yeah let 's hear about your day .

just trying to be civil dwayne .

i 'm saying you 're about as romantic as a bag of sand .

what are you saying ?

i do n't know ...

stop ! stop ! i do n't need the money . you can have it all .

easy to purchase , hard to detect . too much potassium can kill a man . just have to ... pick a discreet spot .

oh jesus christ ...

listen -

right behind you .

then what the hell are you all about ?

hey we 're all friends , right ? friends do n't squeal on friends , that 's not what jesse segundo is all about .

you 've done without it long enough , ma .

do n't you want it ?

you do ?

people have been asking me about that story in the paper . i told them you were the first person on the scene . they were asking me for all the details .

i did n't know you were coming .

what do you think ? heart attack ?

we 're doing a check on the manufacturers' serial number , see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch . what 's your take on these local boys ? are they providing any answers ?

no , it does n't . neither does his blank tape . any news on that ?

that does n't tell us much . did you run a check on the gas like i told you ?

but nowhere near three million dollars worth . i would say maybe twenty thousand .

we retrieved a few things from the trunk , including a steamer trunk , or the remnants of a trunk , the brass clips and so forth .

you want to hear the good news first , or the bad news ?

two hundred cops ? was mario sanchez there ? he owes me money .

winner ! four , winner !

no , i just assumed ...

those are five hundred dollar chips .

the band has been playing over an hour .

i 'm with the band . i 'm the lead singer .

one of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week . i was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up , when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing . including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills . i knew something was wrong . cause this guy 's got a regular job , no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash . but i tested the bills , infrared . the whole thing . and they checked out . 100 % .

yeah . we already been there . this is big , kenny . benjamins . secret service calls 'em superbills . banks ca n't even tell the difference .

i know teddy wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too , did n't you ?

how 'd you know ?

in 1959 , the united states was very friendly with the shah of iran . we wanted his oil , so for the shah 's birthday , the government gave him a gift -- a u.s. treasury intaglio press . the only one to ever leave the country . five years ago ricky tan bought that press on the black market .

how 're they getting into the u.s. mint to use the presses ?

it 's a myth . some kind of counterfeit .

so what 's your story ?

how do we know you 're not lying ? let me see your badge .

i 'm sorry , you looked like you traveled in the best circles . but hey , i understand . make yourself at home , isabella . champagne , caviar , whatever you want . my ship is your ship .

san juan ! you must know my good friend pedro martinez hernandez hector elizondo .

lee , you okay ?

i said get on your feet !

any girl ? okay . let 's start with that one .

never leave home without it . lee , this one 's on me . you save your money .

a little mu-shu .

the plaza hotel ?

i always wanted to go to madison square garden . see the knicks play .

she 's going home to new york . i need some ice .

no problem .

it 's worth it to me .

lee , wait a second . it 's not worth it , man . he 's making you do this .

just go !

we have to get to the penthouse .

lee !

wait a second . there 's guards all over the place . you 'll need a distraction .

isabella ? are you crazy , man ? she almost got us killed . she 's setting you up again !

lee , what the hell are you doing ?

buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune .

red dragon .

lee . i just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash .

end of the line .

we 're slowing down . this must be it .

now that i believe .

yes he did . he also invented the bicycle .

benjamin franklin , he discovered electricity .

hello , benjamin .

that depends . how do the fu-cang-long usually kill their victims ?

as long as you 're asking ... i think you have a pretty good voice .

tell me the truth , carter . do you think i have a good voice ?

no mu-shu .

what 's a chinese heaven ?

i do n't believe in reincarnation . so i wo n't see you in the next world .

i wo n't talk to you , you do n't talk to me . we 'll die in peace .

look , man i 'm sorry . i know you got a thing for her .

what 's the first thing i told you -- never trust nobody . how could you fall for that shit ? i knew she was dirty .

we both know you would never take a bullet for someone else .

i do n't need a turn !

no , i do n't believe this shit -- it 's a microphone . lee , she 's wired ...

what is it ?

snoopy ? i love snoopy .

is it hot in here ?

it 's a long story .

i 'm sorry , lee . why did she leave you ?

carter , there 's something i have to tell you . you were right about what you said in hong kong . all i do is work . never take a day off . it 's all i have right now .

yeah , that 's definitely the woman from ricky tan 's boat , and she 's staying in his suite at his hotel , i told you this would work out . they still just talking ?

yeah , what about when godzilla was coming ? you people were screaming your asses off .

maybe . but not like asians . we never panic .

because when the shooting started he was way too cool . see most white people , when there 's shooting , they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like `` aaaahhh ! ! ! aaaahh ! ! ! !

how do you know he 's our man ?

not bad . now every crime , somewhere , has a rich white man taking his cut . every single one . now in our case , we know the rich white man is steven reign .

i guess you 're going to have to trust me on this one .

you said --

all the evidence against him disappeared , the smuggling case was unsolved . tan resigned and went over to the triads openly .

he found out his partner , tan , had been working for the triads all along . before my father could prove it , he was killed in the line of duty .

you 're not very good at this , are you ?

no . she 's a school teacher .

what are you gon na do about it , grasshopper ?

why the hell should you believe him ? he had us beat up . naked . that 's nasty shit .

not yu . you !

detective yu ? never met him .

you .

you 're pathetic , man . when 's the last time you had some fun ? when 's the last time you took a night off , had a date ?

do n't look at my ass !

that 's ricky tan ? he 's four feet tall . i 'll go over with you right now , shake him down .

she said i could pick any girl i want .

how you doin ' ?

i am a tourist .

carter ... you ready to have some fun ! ?

no , we 're here for information , to find out where a man named ricky tan is . we must tread softly and keep our ears open .

that 's what i 'm talking about . a real hong kong night club . you want an altoid ?

mu-shu ? you 're hungry ?

you invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat .

those girls drove off because of you .

fine with me .

now you know .

the secret service almost busted reign at his casino in macao , but the place burned down before we could move in .

if i 'm wrong then my cover is blown .

what are you doing hanging out with baby duck ?

no . freddy ching 's , in crenshaw .

let him find out on his own . i want the hong kong police handling this .

i do n't think it 's over . there are casinos all over this country . let me make you a rich man , lee . do n't make the same mistake he did .

nobody can protect me . i 'll make a deal with you , lee . but only iff you 'll get me out of hong kong .

the police can protect you .

do n't .

i know , master , but ...

no . your father . your father and ricky tan were my favorite students ... and for such awful things to happen as they did --

he was the best i ever trained , you know .

this is still hong kong .

that 's cool . we 're gettin ' to know each other . this is a good thing . i 'm carter .

what is your name ?

in used currency . nothing bigger than a fifty .

you do n't move , you understand ? ! you do n't move !

and that , of course , would be me .

feds asked for me ?

hey , sir , it was a pleasure to preserve johnson 's ass . well ... you know what i mean .

good job .

he stole my wheel !

ooo , there 's a chill . love that .

oh my god . griffin .

what are you doing here ?

no , please , i do n't --

i am sorry , but i have too much respect for women .

i am from outa town .

good god , ya 'll !

yes , i think so .

that 's not how it goes .

no , no . i 'm full . too much fin and hump , you know , gives me gas . scuse me .

that one is my favorite . chicken puff with shark fin .

you like it ?

juntao 's standing orders were to kill everyone . there were never witnesses .

it happens .

thank you . i learn a great deal .

let 's go . everybody take off ?

when we go inside , you let me handle everything , you hear ? this is my man , you dig ? my informant . you know what an informant is ?

hey , stop . we 're just gon na wind up in some bar , drinking ' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you 'll start singin ' beach boy songs again . then i 'll really get depressed .

no . i just made it up .

when a man steps in dung , it is obvious . there is no need to rub it in his face . the smell is the same .

what plate ?

i thought you were taking me to the consulate .

witnesses .

where were we ?

i am not responsible for your assumptions .

you speak english !

yeah , well you 're in american now . everybody 's got guns . that tricky shit with your hands is gon na get your ass shot to hell .

look at me ! my dress is ruined . i look like shit .

yeah . so why you look do down ?

you do n't like it ?

wait a minute . i 'm not riding in that .

eleven thirty tomorrow the ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is . he said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity .

you think this is funny , carter ? you send for someone from explosives ! ? four men just died in there !

because with your special talents , i 'm sure you 'll do a better job .

i 'm talking about the girl .

he is the situation .

where do we find him ?

how did i do this ? ! maybe you did n't notice but i 'm in jail !

what are you talking about ?

i would n't touch that if i were you .

shit , i ai n't interested in puttin ' my hands on you . that does nothin ' for me . no . i do n't need to be pattin ' no ass . all i 'm sayin ' is , how do i know you 're not a cop ?

this is not a good way to start a relationship , stickin ' a gun to a man 's head , feelin ' around his personal equipment . make him think you do n't trust him .

i want to speak with my daughter !

take the money with you tonight . pack it in six dragons . you will be contacted again .

hello .

can i speak with her ?

hello .

yes .

it 's griffin .

i am so sorry about your men .

come on . let 's get you some dry clothes .

i understand , sir . but you are an honored guest of the united states ...

i am not an american , mr. russ . my daughter is not an american .

he is very good .

i will not have friends in america .

after i left ?

right .

maintain eye contact .

you bet ya , coach .

i 'm really sorry that i hurt you , brian .

it happens to be how i feel .

we do it to our dog .

eight is good ... `` v '' could be victory .

okay -- have a seat ... gently , carefully .

do n't be nervous , maggie . let us visualize . remember what bob said ? `` be the ball . ''

bob is making her visualize the ceremony .

tell me , why does maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding ? she 's already done this .

maggie !

i 'm sorry , too . wow . that only took us between years to say .

i merely write the stuff . you 're the one that serves it up .

that 's not nothing to do with it . you cooked this story up and you know it .

poor ike .

look , he 's running after her .

... just call me when you have it . ike , how is the story coming ? is she a man-eater ?

well , i 'm good , i do n't know if i 'm best .

oh yeah ! i happen to know from reliable sources that nietzche got expenses and a rental car .

do n't say `` spec '' like it 's a dirty word . nobody ever paid shakespeare to write a play ! plato never got a book advance ...

and you defending her ?

i do n't know . i 'm working on it . i was on the wrong track .

same as you said . what did you call her ? a `` man-eater '' , `` a devouring death goddess . ''

not bad . i was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when maggie met me .

guess you 'd know about that . you 're an entomologist , right ? how 's business ?

well , i 'm writing another article on the cacophony .

good fact . well , you let me know .

i am just such a reporter . and you are ?

-- the luau for maggie .

oh , betty . i take it you 're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you 're throwing --

well , wedding cake freezes . this we know .

i was , because if you said `` yes '' right away , i would n't get to say this next part . and i 've been practicing it . ready ?

you were not .

they 're mine . i 'm turning in my running shoes to you .

used ?

i wanted to talk to you about why i run or ride away from things .

it 's something i 've always wanted to do .

i 'm okay with that .

i love you , too .

about a minute ... ?

or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress .

i already explained about that .

or the sexual habits of locusts ?

i had it under control . now they feel sorry for me .

i 'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you .

yes it is . and it does n't mean anything .

kind of isolated .

your filter 's clogged . this takes unleaded .

hmmm ... figuring out what kind of music i like and then finding me a rare album . you 're not trying to soften me up , are you ?

of course .

fine . the newspaper 's upside down . that 's better than fine .

agreed .

even with everything that 's happened i 've still never been married and i still deserve a beautiful dress .

you do n't know .

no . i think i said something eloquent like , `` so , uh -- maybe we should , ya know . what do you think ? ''

i 'm a work in progress .

maybe it 's just me , but -- if you got to dress it up , it does n't ring true .

highly suspect .

what an incredible chauvinistic observation .

no , i 'm not afraid . just ... maybe someday .

cindy the manicurist .

you 've been here for three minutes . what did you do to her ?

give me that !

really ?

twice ...

everest . is that right ?

that 's fair .

i 'm not here to make you feel bad . i 'm here for vindication . in my heart ...

you 'll answer my questions ?

excellent .

originality is my speciality .

wedding . wedding . you just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row .

what are you talking about ?

okay .

no , i 'm just going to head home .

you okay ? i 'm closing .

he 's not coming . watch . he 's not coming .

grandma !

you 're right . it 's not funny now . maybe we both grew up .

but i 'm weird .

no , i do n't think you 're like , `` i 'm charming and mysterious in a way that even i do n't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you '' . very hard to compete with . especially to us married women who have lost our mystery .

because you think i 'm all like ... `` hey man , check me out '' .

i know . i think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves .

yes .

it 's probably because you got him fired .

stop it . when you talk like that , i get turned on and it frightens me .

yes , i 've seen it . and i have to say it 's the rudest and most offensive ... joke anybody 's ever played on me !

no , it 's humiliating and you 've been doing it since i was a kid . i do n't like it . stop . you may not like having a daughter with problems . but guess what ? i do n't like having a father who 's drunk all the time . i 'll eat in my room .

maybe she has n't read the paper ...

no , no . you 're her best friend .

so you 're angry . big deal .

what am i going to do with a microwave ?

you take the microwave ?

nope .

there 's no why , annie . i 'm just not up for it . i never said i was .

houseboats do n't go anywhere .

what ?

i 'm not at the top of the empire state building . i 'm here .

i told you . nothing --

i do n't know what to say about it , walter . it was a form of temporary insanity . but i had to tell you about it because --

i do .

you could n't .

and then i 'll see you in new york --

we will ? the symphony ? okay . i 'll take you to the russian tea room for pelmeni .

go to the symphony --

you sure you do n't want to drive with me ?

nope .

i love you , walter . did anyone ever call you anything other than walter ?

i hope he does n't get out his slides .

i 'm going to run back to walter 's arms , if he 's still have me .

`` dear annie : thanks for your letter . it was great . we 're very excited about meeting you in new york on valentine 's day and seeing if we are m.f.e.o . sleepless in seattle . ''

this is a photo of hair .

it 's a sign --

you were standing in the middle of the street ?

i love you , too .

what ?

i could n't do it . how did i get here ?

i know .

men never get this movie .

listen to this , i love this part --

plus he fell in love with a temp .

yes .

i should say something in this about magic .

right .

you are . you 're losing your mind . what about walter ?

it sounds like the name of a mattress store --

they knew it . time , distance , nothing could separate them . because they knew . it was right . it was real . it was ...

what 's with you ?

there 's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --

about what ?

you want a tail . i got a guy in seattle --

i 'll tell you the truth , i heard this guy on a call-in radio show and i might not marry the person i should marry because i 've become obsessed with him .

okay .

honey , he was n't right for you .

this is a complete disaster . i wanted him to find a wife , but he 's got the wrong one --

please --

perfect . sandbag the father .

thank you , tom . i feel so much better just having blown this off .

i got married because betsy said we had to break up or get married . so we get married .

i mean , why did you get married ? was it all fireworks and trumpets and --

i think i 'm going crazy , tom . i really do . are you happily married ?

so you 'll get married in a new dress .

mom , we already ...

destiny takes a hand .

granny 's dress . oh , mom .

hi .

why me ? what about jay ?

and i do n't want to invade your privacy --

why not ?

no .

good . how long ago did your wife die ?

hello .

i do n't know --

and you 're worried about him .

you do n't like the one he was now ?

no last names , jonah . hello there , you sound younger than our usual callers . how come you 're up so late ?

what kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio ?

they met at the empire state building , only they did n't . never mind .

you 'll see .

seventy ... eight .

when 's the latest time you were out there ?

hey , my plate is full .

i have forty-two . so that would definitely cover taxicabs , i think .

it 's y. o. h .

h and g. hi and goodbye .

get out .

you said we could go to new york .

fine . i wo n't say anything . you can marry count dracula .

yes .

are you going with her ?

the one who wrote us .

jonah , this is n't fair . you do n't know victoria . i hardly know her myself . she is , in fact , a mystery to me . she tosses her hair a lot . why does she do this ? i have no idea . is it a twitch ? does she need a haircut ? should she use barrette so it does n't keep falling in her face ? these are things that i 'm willing to get to the bottom of , and that is why i am dating her . that is all i am doing . i am not marrying her . can you appreciate the difference ? that 's what single people do , they try people on and they see if they fit . but nobody fits perfectly , everyone is an adjustment .

the water tastes better in the kitchen .

i was thirsty .

thank victoria for dinner .

jonah !

she 's going to cook something for us ?

i figure we could go to new york , catch the knicks , and since we 'd be there anyway , obviously we 'd go to the empire state building --

here is seattle . and here is baltimore . case closed .

listen to this --

the heels on these shoes are very large . why have i never noticed this ? the heels on these shoes are grotesque .

like do you believe in heaven ?

i miss her . what do you think happens to someone after they die ?

it 's nice to meet you , jessica .

jed 's got cables .

what do you think ?

it does n't . they ask you .

but not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you 're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it 's just a drink , if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you do n't you can go home if you see what i mean . i wonder if it still works this way .

this is no good . she 's looking for someone french . or greek . `` dear sleepless in seattle : i live in tulsa . '' where is that ? --

just out of curiosity , how did they get our address ?

right . i 'm sorry , jonah , i 'm sorry .

so i can go .

does red pepper go under r or p ?

no , i 'm not , but --

dad , i do n't know about this one --

nobody else is going to know it was us .

what ? !

it 's never happening again . right ?

i can hear you walking around sometimes . at first i thought it was a robber . go ahead , tell her , dad .

do you like it ?

do you like baseball ?

well , here 's the number . if you ever find yourself sleepless , give us a call . we also ... do babysitting .

now that i 'm seeing someone , it 's a whole other thing .

how 's jonah taking it ?

you saw her in the airport and then here ?

microwave . five minutes .

i 've already solved it . i 've hired a hit man .

i know her pretty well . maybe i could call her --

we ca n't finish the job . she 's on her sixth painter , now she 's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --

so whatdya say ? i 'll get the check , and i 'll call you in eight months .

you < u > are < /u > the first woman i 'm going out with .

hi .

no . my name is quintero . mister quintero .

i mean it . i know your work record . you were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that ? you had a real future with this company , but you let those reds stir you up . and now they 'll sell you down the river . why do n't you wake up , ray ? that 's your name , is n't it , ray ?

got any more ideas ?

you want 'em all arrested ?

mornin ' .

how goes it ?

i say we got ta take action . now .

take a drink . calm down !

he will if he wants us to go on blasting .

so much the better .

super 's busy -- with your negotiatin ' committee .

why are they singing , mama ?

no , you do n't . have you learned nothing from this strike ? why are you afraid to have me at your side ? do you still think you can have dignity only if i have none ?

you mean you 're ready to give up ?

it 's a lot to them . they 'd do anything to open that mine .

and you know why ? because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two , three months . what 's it to them if the mine 's shut down a little longer ?

but you are needed . especially now -- with most of the other men away . you 're captain of the stand-by squad .

why not ? i 'm not needed here .

ramn -- you ca n't .

when ?

be still ...

yes . to plan for the picket line tomorrow .

okay . then , tomorrow , i take the kids with me to the picket line .

backward .

no .

but it 's yours . i wo n't let them ...

because if we lose , we lose more than a strike . we lose the union . and the men know this . and if we win , we win more than a few demands . we win ... ... something bigger . hope . hope for our kids . juanito ca n't grow strong on milk alone .

you are no good to me -- in jail .

a fighter , huh ?

was it expensive , the beer ?

i did not mean to weep again . why should i weep for joy ?

esperanza , have you forgotten what it was like before the union came ? when estella was a baby , and we could n't even afford a doctor when she got sick ? it was for our families ! we met in graveyards to build that union !

what has it got me , your union ?

first we got to get equality on the job . then we 'll work on these other things . leave it to the men .

what 's more important than sanitation ?

we ca n't get everything at once . right now we 've got more important demands .

do you think i like living this way ? what do you want of me ? !

i listen to it . every night . when you 're out to the beer parlor .

it is n't right , she says . was it right that we bought this ... this instrument ?

why did n't you support her ? you 're the worst of the lot .

yeah . lots of provocation lately . they figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge , maybe they can bust the strike .

do n't horse me . price of zinc 's never been higher . they do n't want no strike -- not with their war boom on .

lus ! come down here !

i know , it 's wrong . just let me go . i 'll leave town ... just let me go .

do the bosses wait ? no sanitation . so my kids get sick . does the company doctor wait ? twenty bucks . so we miss one payment on the radio i bought for my wife . does the company store wait ? `` pay -- or we take it away . '' why they in such a hurry , the bosses ' store ? they 're trying to scare us , that 's why -- to make us afraid to move . to hang on to what we got -- and like it ! well , i do n't like it i 'm not scared ... and i 'm fed up -- to here !

yeah ? first door on the right . it ai n't that dirty . just kinda ' filthy is all .

good . i fucking hate australians .

are you australian ?

what can i do for you ?

shhh .

all i saw was the headlights . the high beams were on .

yeah .

yeah .

first rate , ai n't it ?

your daughter needs you . go .

will you do that ? then i want you to get out of the room .

never mind . just do what i say . he holds out the baggie . colette backs away .

no , you 're wrong , i tried to tell myself the same thing but i could have gotten up . i could have done something .

why not ?

please open the door , danny .

it 's me .

who is it ?

is that how you play ?

and you admire that ?

like you ?

never heard of him .

turns out i 'm allergic to steel-toed boots . go figure . by the way , i 'm not looking for a matching set . where 's quincey ?

what happened to your eye ?

oh . hi .

why ? they do n't hold him for more than a day or two .

fuck you .

nothing .

what ?

oh , he 's a keeper all right .

come on , cheer up . it could be worse .

i 'm fine . little nervous ... little disappointed that i did n't finish this myself .

i knew that if these were the guys i was looking for , i 'd have to set up a deal so sweet , they would n't be able to walk away from it .

how ?

it 's not too late to show her you 're sorry .

you 've got to deal with this sooner or later , tom . you ca n't keep hiding .

billy sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in gardena a few weeks ago . said you looked so bad , he barely recognized you .

it 's tom .

because i do n't want to see you end up like kujo and those other losers . i thought that maybe if you knew that i did n't use , you might see it in yourself to go clear .

i do n't trust anybody .

this is n't like that queen elizabeth question , is it ?

but ... i 've seen you .

what the hell is that ?

okay

no . i 'm good .

you 're going to have to give me a little more than that , jimmy .

he does n't have one .

personal protection . it 's a dangerous world we live in , jimmy , a very dangerous world .

you wan na score some go-fast ?

can you set that up ?

i think so . i mean , we 'd have to talk to him .

yeah , pooh-bear . dude is a big-time cook . i 'm talking dire .

you 're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine . here . have a beer .

i 'm hurting .

oh ... that . ah , he was just juiced . he would n't have did nothin '

lead the way .

midnight ?

you might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose . or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter ?

that was my idea .

come on , guys ...

pull your pants down .

why do you say that ?

maybe you 're the one who is n't taking me seriously .

anything for a dear friend .

yeah , i uh , have a buyer who 's looking for about a quarter 's worth .

um , i think the warren commission has been closed for a while .

pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant .

murder . beautiful .

that 's real sweet , garcetti . thanks .

news-flash , tanner . i 'm a fucking rat .

bullshit . he 's a liar .

look man , i just wanted to make some dough and disappear . i did n't want to wait around for domingo to figure out who doubled back on him .

after that ass-whipping you gave me ?

you better not be blowing smoke up my ass , flynne .

i met the guy at a party . he said he wanted to do a biggie . he 's new in town so i offered my services .

soon . i promise . we 'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear . in the mean time , trust me , he has no idea that you ratted him out .

tell me what ?

do n't you wonder why i do it ?

thanks for not judging me .

you think i 'm a judas ?

god damn , flynne , you are one observant tweaker .

i 'm making the small buy tonight ... if i do n't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something . if everyone is happy , we 'll do the big deal later in the week .

now that i can help you with . nasty boy ... goes by the name of pooh-bear . he 's a chef . check with palmdale p.d . i 'm sure they 're keeping box scores on the guy .

garcetti , you 're teeth , they 're fucking perfect .

i 'll tell you why you did n't help - because you 're a chickenshit tweaking snitch . you 're a bottom feader , flynne .

quit feeling sorry for yourself , tom . it gets old .

first you want me to ask for directions , then you do n't . which is it ?

there 's no motels around here .

it 's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch .

really ?

and believe me , word will get out that you 're a pro rat .

spit it out , captain .

they did n't want to give up those one-fifty-fives , sir .

resistance ?

find a chaplain .

did you see what he did , back there ? he stepped right into the open , so i could get across .

that must be four thousand yards .

yep .

we got us a tent , forty-two feet across , eighteen feet at center , hundred-and-ten foldin ' chairs . circuit 's eleven towns , covers all ' a hasset county and most ' a weller county . i expect that upon completion of my military service i will be joinin ' said ministry .

so they travel around from place to place and preach ?

in the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch hudson with a big ole ' trailer .

i 'm jackson . i 'm from west fork , tennessee . my pappy 's a preacher . him and his two brothers got a ministry , the blessed church of the wandering gospel .

fuck private james ryan , fuck him , just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch .

wade , sarge , corporal insect , all of us , hell , i 'll bet even the captain has a mother .

reiben , how many time i got to tell you , i 'm from tennessee .

hell , no , last time i shot a corporal , cap ' n miller near bit my head off .

jackson ?

it 's worth it .

do n't that get kind of expensive , cap ' n ?

say what , cap ' n ?

i 'm in my backyard , lying in my hammock , with my arm around my wife , listening for the sound of breaking glass .

what the hell 's the matter with you , jackson ?

they do n't send planes to put out machine guns . two flank runners with surpressing fire . i 'm going right , whoever goes left has to be fast .

sir , i have an opinion on this matter .

you did n't volunteer , jackson .

thank him and tell him we 're sorry about his loss .

no , but he heard firing , just east , less that a kilometer .

i do n't expect to live that long .

where are you from , captain ?

some .

i was n't made for this .

dashes across the street .

that 's not all . there were nine gunners on the eighty-eights , one had a broken heel on his boot , two had bratwurst for supper last night , one of them is named fritz , the other , hans , maybe , i do n't know , it 's hard to tell .

well , if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo , we might stand a chance , but not against those tanks .

but , that 's my personal brand of stupidity , i feel kind of proprietary about it , if you do it again , you 're busted .

just what i want to do .

no , but if i get any worse , you 'll have to relieve me .

that 's the rub . i liked wade . who 's ryan ? if they 're both standing in front of me and i have to shoot one or the other , how do i choose ? look at my hand , there it goes again .

except this time , the mission is a man .

it could be worse . you know the first thing they teach you at o.c.s. ? lie to your men .

yeah .

shoves the needle into wade 's neck . thick vein . pumps the morphine straight to wade 's brain . motions impatiently to sarge .

pulls wade 's hands from the wound . pours sulfa powder .

no . it comes and goes . it stops when i look at it .

yup , hell of a mission .

three for three .

command is n't going to let them withdraw and the germans sure as hell are n't going to let them surrender .

they guys here are n't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up .

you think they 'll be alright ?

it 's not normal , not reading letters from home .

you ever going to open those letters ? miller keeps his eyes on the maps .

he 's right , captain , it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys .

uh , captain ...

yep , hell of a mission .

fresh out .

caen ?

worked , did n't it ?

rolls his eyes , takes a breath . scrambles into the gap . the other five right behind .

goddamn it !

here they come .

hears the faint distant rumble of the tank . barely has time to react . sees :

get back to your positions !

cocks his thompson . settles down behind some sandbags .

looks like tea time , maybe they 're brits .

scans the germans with his binoculars .

has anyone ever told you , you 're officer material ?

but we accomplish the mission .

except for the last part , that one 's not bad .

why 's that ?

sir , if you were not a captain , i would compliment you , now , for being an excellent liar .

in addition , as i pointed out earlier , i have a fondness for cheese and i hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the ramelle products , when we arrive there , to see if they live up to their excellent reputation . moreover , i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private james ryan and i 'm more than willing to lay down my life , and the lives of my men , especially you , reiben , to help relieve her suffering . the men thoroughly enjoy the performance .

you have orders , too .

reiben , there 's a fairly good chance you 're not going to die at all .

huh ?

general gavin is going to be very irritated at you , captain .

well , i , for one , like cheese .

i 'm listening , sir .

i should be on my way to caen , sir . it 's like beethoven , the guy 's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf . go figure , i mean , who 'd he piss off ? and here i am , the beethoven of ladies foundation garments , one step away from caen , the center of the known lingerie universe and instead , i 'm going to ramelle to save some fucking private who 's probably already dead .

sure , reiben .

captain , can i ask you a question ?

no , i 'm not , kaback is , honest . or what about faulkner ? or that little guy with the glasses ?

sir , what if they send some other company into caen ahead of us while we 're pinned down here ?

captain , can i put in for a transfer ?

fires the eighty-eight .

you set ? sarge nods .

i 'd like to go , sir .

look at upham , you do n't hear him complaining .

no , i just happen to take the captain 's advice and look at the bright side of things .

hey , i got a mother . jackson , you got a mother ?

captain , he 's fast !

damn fool . sir .

i usually like surprises .

out of the frying pan , into the fucking latrine .

he 's fast , captain , i saw him .

get lost .

how fast ?

how can you , how can you say that ?

the , uh , cynthia branson estate was worth how much ? because her family ...

so you refuse to answer my questions ?

keep it .

oh yeah , let me give you another card .

for going to school ?

is it a gift for your wife ? are you getting a set together ?

hi .

no , no , do n't go in there .

look , i 'm really sorry that mom and dad made you take me in . really . if it 's such a big deal , i 'll go . but remember this , it used to be fun . it used to be warped , twisted and hilarious , and i mean that in the best possible way , i mean it as a compliment . i mean , i 'm sorry t-i-m left you . but i am not t-i-m .

why do you eat that stuff ? there 's no food in your food . not too loud , the red line 's there for a reason .

the world is full of guys . be a man . do n't be a guy .

no , you 're not a guy .

alright .

please ?

lloyd , give it up .

you 're an inspiration lloyd ; you should go on the seven hundred club or something .

he 's got that nervous talking thing . i told him not to speak .

i told him to be himself .

meaning that she made the second date a family audition , which is the kiss of death for lloyd .

come on , it 's graduation .

hey , i know this is a strange thing to say , but maybe diane court really likes lloyd .

he 'd like to start serving immediately .

lloyd , she 's being difficult .

do n't say that , it 's not good for you . you 're ...

no . i told you everything , you lied to me . i would have done anything for you .

alright , alright . go ahead . when i 'm old , give me someone like me , but go ahead .

what am i supposed to think ?

honey !

well then do n't pick it up . you know what 's best .

' i like him ' ? diane , i 'm talking about being honest with people , being decent ...

diane , i 'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy . give him a present , here , let him know you still care . give him this pen .

dad , you and i have talked about this . lloyd and i have talked about this . believe me , this is well-covered territory .

i like him a lot .

dad , why are you acting this way ? is this because of the other morning ?

diane ! alright , let 's stop this right now . let 's not put our energy into something ridiculous . this is n't even smart thinking .

it does n't feel right to me . i , i do n't even have the right luggage yet .

you 've always called before , always . now i 'm not asking what you did , i just want to know that you 're alright .

so anyway , these two federal marshals meet the plane , and they take our address , and they ask us never to fly with 'friendly skies ' again .

crash paranoia .

goodnight .

you 're going to take a big step , a big leap , and before you do , i just want one thing from you , miss . you stand up straight and admit you 're special .

no , no , just listen . you won the wreath fellowship .

i just had a phone call .

what ?

i 'm sorry .

diane , in a million years , you could never be a ... priss . it 's all working out for you honey , do n't you see ? it 's all working out , just like we planned . all the years of summer school , all the vacations you gave up , it 's all working out just the way we planned ...

everybody thinks i 'm a priss .

god , that 's ... this is ridiculous .

what are you doing ?

okay , i promise i will . just come here a minute , i want to show you something .

having taken a few courses at the university this year , i have glimpsed our future , and all i can say is ... go back .

if we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier . you know , your room is always ready for you , you can always come home if ... alright , what do you want me to do ?

this is me telling you about me .

okay .

okay .

what ?

i love you .

i 'm sorry .

lloyd , i love you , okay ?

no , that 's fine . she 'll tell everybody , but that 's fine .

did you talk to corey ?

you shared it with a dick .

lloyd , we shared the most intimate thing two people can share .

no , i do n't , i do n't .

it sounded like you did .

okay . it 's good knowing this .

i think that we should spend some time apart .

i know . lloyd , let 's not start putting things on this level .

how do you know what i 'm going to say ?

i 've never sent a letter like that , you know ? i mean , i felt like i wanted to tell you something , but i did n't put it in the letter , and i did n't say it , but i want to say it now , i 'm not sure if i should say it , you know , 'cause people always say it and do n't mean it , but i think that i mean it , so , um , i just wanted to tell you ...

are you comfortable ?

little more gas . ease it up . hold on- minor setback . now you feel confident , right ?

oh . i was putting the ...

if you 'll just maybe ease it into second .

yeah ?

yeah . now , when you feel like you 're confident , ...

yeah .

no .

it 's okay , everybody does that .

okay .

you have to meet bess .

okay , bye .

stop by later .

me ? sure i do .

mmmm .

yeah .

no , i 'm serious .

job ? being a great date .

basic . hmmm .

sure i do .

they knew of you . now they know you .

have a good sleep .

i hereby surrender my duties as keymaster , give me a beer .

it 's the worst job since keymaster .

so it 's an honor ?

oh . um , would it be terrible if i wanted to go home early ?

yeah

goodbye .

eight . eight o ' clock .

y'know , you 're not in england yet , you know that of course , and by the way , i want to just tell you that i lived in england for a few months ,

actually , i think that i ...

saturday , i have some things to do around the house .

are you busy on friday ?

no , i read it on the message .

yeah . i just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to england , and i wanted to tell you that i thought your speech was really incredible .

you 're freaking out here man .

work that jab , work that hook , work that jab , okay , take a break , take a break .

yeah .

`` you ca n't know the horrible disappointment i feel ... ''

very talented .

go ahead , pick it up if you want .

hi , lloyd . this is my eighth and final call ...

you mean like career ? uh , i do n't know . i 've , i 've thought about this quite a bit sir , and i 'd have to say considering what 's waiting out there for me , i do n't want to sell anything , buy anything or process anything as a career . i do n't want to sell anything bought or processed , or buy anything sold or processed , or ... process anything sold , bought or processed , or repair anything sold , bought or processed , you know , as a career i do n't want to do that . so , uh , my father 's in the army , he wants me to join , but i ca n't work for that corporation , so what i 've been doing lately is kickboxing , which is really a , uh , new sport , but i think it 's got a good future . as far as career longevity goes , i do n't really know , because , you know , you ca n't really tell . your training sticks as a fighter , you know , but it 's no good , you know , you have to be great , but i ca n't really tell if i 'm great until i 've had a couple of pro fights . but i have n't been knocked out yet . i do n't know , i ca n't figure it all out tonight sir , i 'm going to hang with your daughter .

i 'm totally and completely serious .

spend as much time as possible with diane before she leaves .

well , we pay for the [ ? ] . that guy did n't want to part with it , a little matter of nine thousand dollars .

how do you pay for one of those ?

thanks lloyd .

hello lloyd .

okay . good afternoon . goodbye .

yeah , she is . good luck .

why do n't i just get your phone number , that 's usually how it works .

the truck ?

the guy with the datsun ?

uh ... okay ... um ...

diane court .

dude , why do you think i keep her tapes ? they 're going to be valuable some day .

lloyd , everybody in that party put something down on their record except you .

my dad 's a lieutenant colonel in the army , he wants me to join , he wants to pull some strings . i mean , there 's no possible way .

lloyd .

how ya doin ' miss evans ?

alright . key ?

this is great , this gives me hope . thanks .

yeah , but how come it worked ? i mean like , what are you ?

yeah .

mike cameron . this is one fresh jam , huh ?

certainly .

diane , everybody loves that you showed up .

maybe we 'll come by tomorrow , help you clear up or something .

you know , every year i throw this party , every year nobody helps me clear up . why am i yelling ?

wow , man . well . listen man , i need you to be the keymaster .

give me my firebird keys !

i love you man

things worked out . i made some money over there , had some laughs , you know . it was good .

sir , the list is correct .

it 's up to you .

should i stay ?

what ?

all right , okay , let 's talk .

i 'd love to , it 'll have to wait until i get back . i have to leave .

there are some things that are unclear . we need to talk .

i 'm sorry to hear that .

it 's good for me - i know them , i 'm familiar with them . it 's good for you - you 'll be compensated . it 's good for the army . you know what i 'm going to make ? artillery shells . tank shells . they need that . everybody 's happy .

i got a shipment of hungarians coming in , i got to make room for them . it 's always something .

it 's true . never happen in cracow , though , we all love you too much .

do you have any idea what 's involved ? the paperwork alone ? forget you got to build it all , getting the fucking permits , that 's enough to drive you crazy . then the engineers show up . they stand around and they argue about drainage - i 'm telling you , you 'll want to shoot somebody , i 've been through it , i know .

some of the boys went crazy , what 're you going to do ? you 're right , it 's bad business , but it 's over with , it 's done . occasionally , sure , okay , you got to make an example . but that 's good business .

we started without you .

yeah , i can .

ghetto police . i 'm a policeman now , can you believe it ?

look it up .

that 's great , thanks .

i work hard for you . i 'll continue to work hard for you .

that 's great .

you 're welcome , i 'm sure you 're doing a great job .

i 've been here . i guess i have n't been out .

what are you doing ?

what 's wrong with it ?

you have any idea what a shirt like this costs ?

pistols , rifles , carbines ... i 'd be grateful .

we 're losing the war , are n't we .

he does n't deserve your loyalty . more important , he 's not worth you making threats against us .

i 'll talk to you later .

no ?

they arrived .

well , i 'll talk to somebody . i 'll take care of it .

there 's nothing you can do . i 'm not asking you to do anything . you came into my office .

it 's dangerous . it 's dangerous , to me , personally .

you think i do n't know what you 're doing ? you 're so quiet all the time ? i know .

this , i do n't know , maybe you can trade it for something .

you try to be fair to people , they walk out the door ; i 've never understood that . what 's next ?

what ?

better this month than last ?

yes .

jews can no longer own businesses , sir , that 's why this one 's for sale .

of course he 's stealing from me , we 're in business together . what is this ? i 'm sitting here , suddenly everybody 's talking like this is something bad . we take from each other , we take from the army , everybody uses everybody , it works out , everybody 's happy .

file a grievance with the economic office , it 's your right .

what now ?

37 usages of himbry located in the registar 's office . 9 tatum 's , 47 riley 's . and that 's just on campus . it 's hopeless .

the killer was trying to get to her . that sorority girl was a distraction .

we know that , son .

on national television .

broad daylight , a crowded movie theatre . this is too much fun for one person .

you 're sure about this two person thing ?

he 's broken his pattern .

the first two were stabbed without thought . the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision .

do n't do that . hang up ... call ...

i heard a noise .

what is it ?

do n't . think bailey .

i wo n't .

no , they broke up again . bailey wo n't stop drinking and sarah ca n't take it anymore .

why would you wan na do that ?

what if i said goodbye ?

what if i said you ?

we 're co-sponsoring the acid rain mixer at the sig ep . house tonight .

ted ? where are you ? are you drinking ? hold on .

i had to change . did anyone call ?

not until youre dead .

its perfect , sidney . no one will ever suspect me . i have proof . im the victim .

you 're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother .

look , yesterday was n't my idea . that was all gale and dollar signs and ratings .

did you do it ?

finish what my son started .

home -- where he lives .

tons and tons .

job hazard . debbie salt , stringer -- newsweek . answer a few questions ?

how do you put up with this greek shit ?

youre not going to get away with this .

poor cotton , could life be a little more cruel ?

why ?

i 'm sorry honey . i got behind .

where have you been ' ? you missed my shining moment . i won the macaroni sundae binge .

it 's okay . i can peddle toilet paper .

tuitions expensive .

just for you , sid .

and we didnt want to do that , sid . we wanted to give you your moneys worth .

a verdict and premiere all on the same day . i love it .

youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there . its a whole world , sid . youre really popular amongst the demented .

i read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly . hook , line ...

are n't most serial killers seemingly harmless ?

you were n't supposed to leave her alone .

and watch her til 8:00 -- i 've got to edit .

there 's nothing . i 'm coming down .

jesus christ !

let 's find out .

ssshh ! what was that ?

..and as lonely as i am ...

maybe not . but think about the sex . as frustrated as i am ...

that 's not the way it 's done .

solid alibis . he was with sidney when she was attacked .

if you were truly a copycat , would n't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could ?

so what made you change your mind about sidney ?

no , i 'm the one who 's sorry . i misjudged you . now if you 'll excuse me , i have some oozing to do .

you have every right to be upset .

i see you read the book .

hello , dwight .

the police are waiting outside . they 're going to take you somewhere safe .

just in case ...

dewey , i 'm completely equipped with mace , alarm whistle , keyring , knife , a degree in defensive combat ...

look , sid , why do n't you take off ? disappear for a few days . i 'll come with you .

as of now , they do n't see any relation . but they 're checking it out . the state , special task force , fbi -- they 're all here . they 'll find the guy .

three hundred people watched ? nobody did anything ?

watch your back .

oh -- a god complex

i 'm everywhere .

but who would operate your camera ?

it 's good to see you involved .

it 's hell week . i 'm pledging the deltas .

sidney . hello . how are you ?

the safety what ? fuck that !

`` and iiiiiiiiiyeiiiii will always love you oooooowuoooooooo will always love you . ''

do n't do this .

i have rehearsal .

i got . i got it . friday the 13th , part 20 .

no , girletta , i do n't leave your side .

yeah , right .

please , i have the perfect excuse .

nah ... i think it 'll die off . it 's opening weekend . let 's see how it goes .

the ghost advances on the young girl , grabbing her , pulling her to him , raising high a long , hunting knife . the young girl is helpless ...

everyone in the theater is screaming . maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie . she eats her popcorn .

the crowd is really with the movie . some even talk to the screen . `` you dumb bitch . get out of the house . '' etc .

and white .

is that cool ? just to leave her like that ?

i 've been waiting for you , baby .

thanks , joel .

i 'll stop by the deltas tonight .

you 're not allowed to ask that .

i got ta hit the library . anatomy . some of us have real majors . you gon na be okay , sid ?

..we only promote safe rubbered sex .

it 's all about sisterhood . everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but ...

..this week 's tke kegger ...

gee , let me think . `` do you want to ... '' is that the best you can do ? some tired hand me down rehash ? hey , pal , no one 's gon na write a book about you . no movie rights . nothing . i 've been through this before and much better i might add .

gale ?

come on , baby . lighten up a little , will ya ?

you are so not funny .

now .

i 'll relay it . you sure you do n't wan na go home ?

i guess gale 's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive .

i 'm sorry , sid , please . i never should have gone along with gale . i know i 'm stupid . i wish i had some good reason to give you but i 'm just stupid . please , sid , do n't be mad at me .

melinda mcgraw ?

oh that 's right . those poor poor people . god ben damon was such a hottie .

nah i think it 's doing so damn well because one of it 's players got iced . i just hope none of us end up dead .

no , jennifer love hewitt . of course it 's me , silly . and i feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself . where are you babe , the movie starts in twenty minutes .

what ? ! but i did everything you said to do !

you seem to be familiar with the stab movies . here 's how we play . i ask you a question . you get it right , your girlfriend lives . you answer wrong , she dies .

i mean , i 'm standing right outside the ladies room door at the plaza theater . your girlfriend christine is in there . she 's all alone . everyone 's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start . i 've got my knife .

uh-huh . look bro , my battery is running out . really wish i could chat , but i ca n't so , later .

do i ?

horror flicks . b-movies from milton 's heyday .

i know every face in here , respect for the unknown actor i suppose , myself included . if you 're looking for maureen prescott --

can i help you ?

jesus gale what happened ?

ok , look . we all know that this has something to do with 'stab 3 ' . what we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about maureen prescott .

four ? there are five .

in my fifteen years as a homicide detective i 've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are miss weathers .

but you wo n't . you 're a good man detective . we think alike . i know you need my help . and i know you know i need your help .

and who would that be ?

a note ?

i wish that was all miss weathers , but there 's more . the killer left a note .

well i interviewed damon once for the show . he was a real obnoxious fuck . any way , the second one , christine perkins , she had a part in stab 2 , did n't she ? she was playing cici .

i 'm sorry miss weathers . allow me to introduce myself , mark kincaid , l.a.p.d . are you familiar with the actor ben damon , or the actress christine perkins ?

oh yeah , how ?

because , that means that we 're dealing with an ordinary , flesh and blood killer . and i know how to handle guys like that .

what did you know about your mother ?

hmm .

i 'll call you mark when you catch the killer , detective .

jesus christ sidney , what happened ? i got a call on my cell from home . they told me that someone was attacked .

no .

there 's someone here who wants to help .

detective kincaid ?

when it 's a threat , you 'll know it .

police are still searching through the debris . could be days before we find her . . . that is , if she 's even there .

i told you , i do n't know where sidney is . and even if there was a third killer , sidney does n't know about it .

mr. rielly ? my name is mark kincaid . i 'm with the l.a.p.d . are you aware of last night 's events ?

watch out sid . randy said the killer 's always superhuman .

sid i can see you !

do n't worry , i 've got a permit for it .

no .

karen colcheck . from woodsboro .

listen , detective , i wan na see this studio where all this shit 's going down .

i was afraid they were bait , something to , ya know , trick you out of hiding .

nevermind , what 'd you two find ?

neither are you , magnum p.i .

you 're not a detective .

i happen to work for the police god dammit !

what part of 'off the record ' do n't you understand ?

the boys said no . she would n't give her name . a month later , the station gets broken into , the file room ransacked .

off the record .

you used to say that was our strength .

what 's wrong with just being gale weathers ? i liked her !

why would the police come to you ?

would you excuse me for a moment ?

your life ?

it 's a pleasure to finally meet you , roman .

oh , come on ! you have made millions off the story of her murder . you 're obsessed with her and you 're obsessed with her daughter !

basements creep me out .

that 's funny .

you know in the movies , i play you as being much smarter .

i dunno but i can tell you that your 's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass ! now come out and fight like a real man you pussy !

i 'm saying things got out of hand . maybe they did take advantage of her ! . maybe the sad truth is , this is not the city for innocence . no charges were brought . and the bottom line is , rina reynolds would n't play by the rules . you wan na get ahead in hollywood , you got ta play the game , or go home .

are you saying she was-

i do n't think so ! just what happened to maureen when she was in hollywood ?

they 're the ones who approved it .

oh come on ! why the hostility ?

really , cause that stunt lost me the lead role in roman polanski 's latest picture . huh , what a coincide i was picked up by roman bridger . well , not exactly the roman i wanted . get my point ? stab 3 is bullshit . fuck , because of your big mouth i 'm here , drinking piss water scotch with second rate fucking celebrities like jennifer jollie and yourself ! hey , i just got an idea . maybe i should have a look at your break line . that your car over there ?

gale weathers . what a surprise .

gale he 's got dewey !

oh my god , angie crick ? from english class ?

hello .

huh , fine .

i 'm not happy that i 'm 35 playing a 21 year old . i 'm not happy that i have to die naked ! and i 'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend 's been cut into mcnuggets .

i 'm just saying , though . what if there 's someone out there stalking actors ? huh ? then what ?

i 'll call you , when you 're on your way .

you 're dead !

are real ? how do you know you 're not hearing things ? how do you know i 'm not someone in your head ? somewhere , you know .

go there .

do n't do it ! if you do one thing to attract attention , one thing , i 'll kill them both . now , do you have somewhere we can be alone ?

great . a spirited one . i 'll be seeing you real soon sidney . real soon .

the final act ? well let 's play asshole !

w-what do you want ?

do you think it 's over sidney ? do you ?

it 's mother , sidney , now be a good girl and turn on the news . do it !

uh-huh i 'm sure . i 've killed someone ! oh my god i 've actually killed someone !

except for me and billy ... we were left for dead ...

and did they really ever explain why hannibal lecter liked to eat people ? do n't think so . you see , it 's scarier when there 's no motive , sid .

dude . what are you doing here ?

thanks , butt wart . you did good .

how 'd you do ?

no , i did n't . i did n't kill anyone , sheriff .

yes , sir .

got ta find me first , you pansy-assed mama 's boy .

you bitch -- where the fuck are you ?

got the ending figured out yet ? time 's running out .

i do n't understand ...

yeah ... and when i called no one answered .

what ?

what ?

or even a good porno .

but this is life . this is n't a movie .

you lost your mom ...

no , billy . i 'm the one who 's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress .

so ...

when are you gon na let that go , sid ? when my mom left my dad -- i just accepted it . this is the way it is . she 's not coming back .

it 's been a year since she died .

now that it 's out of your system .

billy ? what the ...

then you should know jason 's mother -- mrs. vorhees was the original killer . jason did n't show up until the sequel .

afraid not .

name the killer in friday the 13th .

now for the real question .

what kind of game ?

i wan na play a game .

his name would n't be steve , would it ?

sure ...

my boyfriend will be here any second and he 'll be pissed when i tell him ...

listen , asshole ...

yes ?

got ta go .

do n't hang up on me .

nah , i do n't think so ...

i have to go now .

that 's not what you said .

so , you got ta boyfriend ?

you have to have a favorite .

uh-huh .

you 're making popcorn ?

what 's that noise ?

you tell me your name , i 'll tell you mine .

i 'm sorry . i guess i dialed the wrong number .

i 'll call for backup .

what about gale weathers ? i sound like a meteorologist ...

dwight . dewey was something i got stuck with a long time ago .

no ! i mean ... i should probably take just you .

what kind of lead ?

what brings you out to these parts ?

deputy ... good evening .

we have n't ruled out that possibil ...

really ? you small town guys are good . and have you located sidney 's father ?

we 're tracking the cellular phone bill .

well , we can hope , ca n't we ? we certainly do n't have any leads . a ghost mask , a cellular phone -- not much there .

serial killer is not really accurate , ma'am . the killer has yet to strike twice .

and why is that ? has something happened ?

i know who you are , ma'am . how 's the eye ?

shit .

you ca n't be here , tatum . this is an official crime scene .

have they found my father ?

you girls ready .

hey , i saw that movie . true story , 'bout some killer in texas .

god , look at this place , it 's the town that dreaded sundown .

somebody called me , dewey . i 'm not making it up .

not yet , but we 're looking . if you need anything ...

any word on my dad ?

did you reach my dad ?

they believe he 's out of state by now . we 'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night . if he 's not picked up by morning -- we 'll do a house to house .

have you contacted the bureau ?

we have n't located her dad yet .

what about the cellular phone bill ?

that ghost mask is sold at both kroger 's and walmart . neither of which keep purchase records .

what were you doing out here ?

hank loomis ' kid ? aw ... jesus ...

that fish smelled strong .

about thirty seconds .

what 's the plan ?

you want to go live ?

what ? what ?

many times .

you owe my mother .

i owe you shit .

please . you owe me .

i want to talk to you .

i 'll send you a copy .

it 'll be out later this year .

yes , that 's right .

and it fucked her up royally . think about it . it makes perfect sense . her mom 's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world , she 's disillusioned , where 's god , etc . completely suicidal . and one day she snaps . she wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year . and homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression .

what if she did it ? what if sidney killed casey and steve ?

who are you ?

looks like you fingered the wrong guy ... again .

can you see me right now ?

so where are you ?

that 's the original part .

so where are you ?

maybe that 's because i 'm not randy .

are you alone in the house ?

because they 're all the same . it 's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who ca n't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door . they 're ridiculous .

got it .

... out at the airport ...

you got it .

do n't come any closer .

she 's the scream queen .

wan na another beer ?

there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie . for instance : 1. you can never have sex . the minute you get a little nookie -- you 're as good as gone . sex always equals death . 2. never drink or do drugs . the sin factor . it 's an extension of number one . and 3. never , ever , ever , under any circumstances , say `` i 'll be right back . ''

i wan na see jamie lee 's breasts . when do we see jamie lee 's breasts ?

what 's leatherface doing here ?

and what would be your motive ?

you 're absolutely right . i 'm the first to admit it . if this were a scary movie , i 'd be the prime suspect .

which is you ...

why would he want to kill his own girlfriend ?

the why 'd the police let him go ?

you 're such a little lap dog . he 's got killer printed all over his forehead .

yeah , i 'm off early -- curfew you know . now that 's poor taste .

peer pressure ... i 'm way to sensitive .

you guys can go up to my parents room ? to talk and ... whatever .

are you serious ?

you heard billy -- shut the fuck up .

tatum !

who ?

but he 's been so patient with me , tatum . you know , with all the sex stuff . how many guys would put up with a girlfriend who 's sexually anorexic ?

billy 's right . whenever he touches me , i just ca n't relax .

oh , god ...

well ... you can only hear that richard gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it .

and you believe it ?

i did n't say that , sid . but you know there were rumors . your dad was always out of town on business . maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman .

it was him , tatum . i know it .

just ignore him . you had good reason to think what you did .

i want you to meet me here right after class , okay ?

this is a mistake . i should n't be here .

just a sec ... i need to talk to someone .

he was there , tatum .

it 's okay . she was supposed to pick me up .

do n't worry . casey and steve did n't bite it til way after ten .

practice ran late . i 'm on my way .

later .

uh-huh , it 's just ... you know , the police and reporters ... it brings it all back .

no prob . i 'll pick you up after practice .

they think it 's school-related ?

fucking clueless -- they 're interrogating the entire school . teachers , students , staff , janitors ...

no way .

tits -- see .

hey , go easy , tatum . he did n't do it .

i thought you dumped her for me .

what do you think ?

ease back , mills .

how is it working for a scumbag like this ? you proud of yourself ?

i guess ... decide for yourself . i do n't know what it says . i 'm going to go .

they 're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go , but i told them not to expect it .

yeah , that 's true .

really ?

did you read in the paper today , about the man who was walking his dog ? he was attacked , and his wallet and his watch were taken . and then , while he was still lying unconscious , his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes . it happened four blocks from here .

no , i have n't heard .

you 've left unfinished business before .

i know what you 're thinking , okay ? you do n't want to get in bed with this every night , but it 's different now . you 're retiring . in six days you 're all the way gone .

so what ? this victim ...

there are seven deadly sins . gluttony , wrath , greed ...

announcing what ?

where was the prostitute ? where was she ?

what ? what ?

where was the girl ?

what the hell 's going on ?

turn around . hands on your head !

her pretty head .

what the fuck is going on ?

what the fuck is going on here ? !

i wish i could have been a normal man like you . i wish i could have a simple life .

we would have gotten you eventually .

you 're going to be remembered , and it 's all because of me . and , the only reason i 'm here right now is because i wanted to be .

i ... i doubt i enjoyed it any more than ... detective mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows . is n't that true ? how happy would it make you to hurt me , with impunity ?

spit it out .

in two months , no one 's going to even remember this happened .

i hate to burst your bubble , but other than the fact that you 're especially sadistic , there 's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours .

i ca n't let you do this ...

well ... what the fuck , man ?

as soon as this is over , i 'm gone .

oh , you want to stay now ?

call for help , and you 'll live . but , you 'll be disfigured . or , put yourself out of your misery .

listen to yourself . you say , `` the problem with people is they do n't care , so i do n't care about people . '' but , you 're already here . you 've been here a long time . so , there 's a part of you that knows , even if everything you say is true , none of it matters .

you 're talking about people who are mentally ill. you 're ...

it was n't one thing , if that 's what you mean . i just ... i ca n't live here anymore . i ca n't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue .

people do n't want a champion . they just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers .

you think you 're preparing me for the hard times ahead ? you think you 're toughening me up ? well , you 're not ! you 're quitting , fine ... but i 'm staying .

you follow the law and do the best you can . it 's all there .

where 's the victory ?

then , he must write about these murders .

no point in arguing anymore ...

the hell i ca n't ! we get in there and we can stop him .

wait ... just wait .

are you alright ?

that 's what it says . jonathan doe .

you 're sure you 're reading that right ? john doe ?

it 's not what you think it is .

the divine comedy . a history of catholicism . a book called murderers and madmen .

yeah , well ... at least we 're out of the office . we 've got pizza .

what ? assessing fines ?

it 's be best if you got to the point , cause i 'm about ready to punch you in the face .

by telling you this , i 'm trusting you more than i trust most people .

let 's go .

sooner or later his luck 's goning to run out .

it 's a fine line between insane and inspired .

sorry about that ... i just ...

they pay cops for the inside scoop , and they pay well .

no kidding ! no fucking kidding !

call an ambulance .

i got him . i got the son-of-a-bitch . see , i was doing really good up till then . lots of street busts . i 've always had this weird luck ... everything always went my way , but this was wild . i got him with one shot ... right between the eyes . next thing i know , the mayor 's pinning a medal on me . picture in the paper , whole nine yards .

never in my twenty-four years , knock on wood . i 've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it . never fired it though . not once . you ?

satisfy our curiosity ?

you tell me . i 'm new in town .

does n't seem like our man , does it ?

in this city , if all the skeletons came out of all the closets ... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again , there 'd be no more room for the living .

then , you tell me what you think we 're doing .

he just may be nuts enough .

just , honestly ... have you ever seen anything like this ... been involved in anything like this ?

okay . but , what ?

no witnesses of any kind ?

all day saturday , and all day sunday . the murderer would want gould to take his time . to have to sit there and decide . where do you make the first cut ? there 's a gun in your face ... but , what part of your body is expendable ?

you go to movies at least ?

how 's that ?

i 'm invited to have a late supper at your house . and , i accept .

this is his stuff . i 've been out in the cold all day .

have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink ? near the food ?

the badge in my pocket says `` detective , '' same as yours .

anyway ... i did my time on door-to-doors , and walking a beat . i did all that shit for a long time .

what ?

there 's a bucket here .

who said this was murder ?

i wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into ?

let me tell you how i want this to go . i want you to look , and i want you to listen .

i ... i do n't follow .

since we 're just starting out , i thought we could go to a bar ... sit and talk for awhile . after that , we 'll ...

i ca n't do this now ... please .

i ca n't be a burden , especially now . i know i 'll get used to things . i guess i wanted to know what someone who 's lived here thinks . upstate , it was a completely different environment . i do n't know if david told you , but i teach fifth grade , or did .

i do n't know why i asked you to come .

if you can , please call me . please . i have to go now ... goodnight .

i do n't know , with this case .

no matter how often i see guns , i still ca n't get used to them .

this is a done deal . all but the paperwork .

crime of passion .

why always like this ? only after the fact ... this sudden realization , that if you shoot someone , or stick a knife in them , that person will cease to exist .

did the wife confess ?

neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours . it was nothing new . but , then they heard the gun go off . both barrels .

passed the todd place comin ' in ... what happened to 'em ?

it just happened to be me ... no need to make any more of it ...

it 's not a sword , ma ... it 's a sabre ! did you kill many damyankees with this sabre , uncle ethan ?

not tonight ... ben , put that sword back .

that 's enough ... go on inside and help lucy set the table ... you , too , deborah !

you 've said that enough ! ... maybe lucy 's dead ... maybe they 're both dead ... but if i hear it from you again , i 'll fight ya , mr. edwards !

it 's all right ... charlie , let 's move outside .

if you 're talkin ' about that crazy murder charge ...

< u > charlie < /u > < u > maccorry < /u > ! ... you were n't fixin ' to marry him ? ?

ethan , you an ' martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay ... charlie , hightail it to head- quarters an ' spread the word ...

now , now ... let 's not grow dis- putatious ...

you all right , sergeant ?

there sure is ! i 'm going to tell you somethin ' ... i was n't going to speak of it ... but i 'll tell you now . did you notice them scalps strung on scar 's lance ? did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance ? long ... wavy hair ...

i got to ask you and martin to ride to the state capitol with me , ethan .

you got one now !

that 's all right , captain ... i do n't need any formal invitation to kill a comanch ...

i did n't give any order to fire !

you got any more orders , captain ?

yes , sir ... but if you 're wrong , < u > captain < /u > clayton , do n't ever give me another !

... as you have of findin ' those girls alive by ridin ' into 'em ... i say we do it my way , ethan ... and that 's an order !

i thought we were trying to get the girls back -- < u > alive < /u > ... we jump those comanches , they 'll kill 'em ... you know that !

you 're right sure you want to < u > jump < /u > 'em , ethan ?

he cometh forth like a ...

you fit a lot of descriptions .

why ? you wanted for a crime , ethan ?

all right ... but keep your eye on me , boy ... i 'm the hard case you 're up against here -- not these childish savages ... if you do n't hear me first time i holler , you better read my mind ... i do n't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand ...

yes , sir ... troop 's about ten miles back ... the colonel sent me looking for you ...

sir ?

hold on , son ... who 's this colonel greenhill you 're talking about ?

i 'm clayton .

they have done ... nothing ... they are my people ...

martin ! ride me as far as the well !

you were born old ...

steady , daniel boone ! you do n't want to miss ... it makes them think their medicine 's stronger than yours ...

me neither ... but this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the nawyecky comanches .

talk !

how 'd you come by this ?

that camp you hit was nawyecka comanche ... chief scar 's bunch ...

i saw it ... and do n't try to tell me it was aunt martha 's or lucy 's ...

she 's alive ... better she 's alive and livin ' with comanches than her brains bashed out ...

what 's that got to do with us ?

she 's been with the bucks ! she 's nothin ' now but a ...

you figger scar means to kill us ?

lem me alone ...

ai n't that too bad ... if you feel that sorry for your kinfolk , i 'm surprised you did n't take up with that squaw wife of yours ...

what 's the sense in it !

nine ... ten !

ethan , quit it !

how should < u > i < /u > know ... she 's your wife !

you ask her !

says her name 's wild goose flying in the night sky ... but she 'll answer to look since it pleases ya ...

cut it out , will ya ...

you got yourself a < u > wife < /u > , sonny !

what ?

let 's go ... i think i stumbled onto somethin ' ...

good night .

how ? you got any horses , or money to buy 'em ... you ai n't even got money to buy cartridges ... jorgensen 's offering you a good livin ' here ...

i always felt like she was ... her folks takin ' me in , raisin ' me like one of their own ...

she 's your nothin ' ... she 's no kin to you at all !

your cattle ? ... < u > debbie 's < /u > cattle !

and you think we got a chance to find her ?

huh ... ? sure i 'm all right ...

easy on that !

if they 're still alive ...

easy ! it 's forty miles , sonny ... horses can do with some grain and a little rest .

what you want me to call you ?

time 's running out ... but i 'm obliged to you .

well , we only got the one lead -- scar ... and where we begin to look , i do n't know ...

i am ... i am ... it 's just that i know martha 'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls ... and if the girls are ... dead ... ethan , do n't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance !

they never find that girl .

only if i 'm dead !

fetch < u > what < /u > home ? ... the leavin 's of comanche bucks -- sold time an ' again to the highest bidder ? ... with savage brats of her own , most like ? ...

i got to fetch her home ...

it 's too late ... she 's a woman grown now ...

you do and i 'll die , martie ... i will ! i 'll just die !

do n't cry , laurie ... i understand how it is ... i 'll just go 'way ...

it is n't fair ...

no , it was n't ... you mighta said you loved me ... you mighta asked me to wait ... at least that 'd have been something ...

i ... i wrote you a letter ... reckon you did n't get it ...

shush ! ... time for bed anyway ... likely these 'll need some takin ' in ... oh , martie , you 're that gaunted ! ... ma 's havin ' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and ...

would n't bother me ... i would n't try it in front of pa , though , was i you ...

what you gettin ' red-in-the-face for ? ... i have brothers , have n't i ?

but could n't you ... ?

she 'd be about thirteen now ...

you do n't remember ?

for god 's sake , what happened to me ?

i would n't have made it by myself .

it 's important - he knows the last chapter .

martin , damnit , what are you up to ? let go of me !

you know what i have to do now , and believe me : i do n't enjoy doing this .

martin , what-

damn it , look at you ! do n't you see what 's happening with you ? we need to get out of here , do n't you understand ? out of this house !

maybe an animal .

`` events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals ... ''

oh , baloney . you should just hear yourself talk !

where have you been all day ?

i miss tommi so much .

we just have to make a new beginning .

i have a funny feeling . do you think we 'll get over all that 's happened ?

hey , take your time . you know time heals better than any shrink ever can .

maybe i should talk to dr. roth about it .

my father was a pilot . and do i know how to fly ?

i 'll do it myself .

do you have a better idea ?

we 'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning .

look at this ! we 'll have to fix the whole wiring . this stuff is dangerous as hell .

you 'll never get away from me !

what else should i do , damn it , he 's dying !

thank you . elisabeth , i did n't mean to ...

oh no , no . you 're not bothering him . he has lots of time since he 's been retired .

you 're doing fine , are n't you ? i mean ... the two of you alone in that house , so far out in the moor .

1976. what happened back then ?

village gossip . you 're a real attraction here .

it 's a pleasure . you 're from the city , right ?

does this dog here belong to you ?

what ?

a tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and , thus , influence your perception .

yes , something was ...

we should leave the past alone .

not so bad , if i could get some peace and quiet around here .

look at this . the lock is totally demolished .

very funny .

ohwhat have i done ?

thank you , ned .

the title wo n't do .

mercutio

writer , is he ?

i know your face . are you an actor ?

you did . but ned alleyn and the admiral 's men have the playing of it as the rose .

see you in jail .

no juliet ? !

ask him .

i swear it . he wants romeo for ned and the admiral 's men .

how much ?

i will play him . bring it tomorrow .

are you writing ?

will it restore my gift ?

yet can not love nor write it .

and your relations ?

nothing comes .

by heaven , i thank you ! i will be your apothecary !

yes , i saw it .

i saw his tamburlaine , you know . wonderful .

gentlemen ! thank you ! you are welcome .

nothing . strangely enough , it all turns out well .

by order of the master of the revels !

of course not !

what 's the title ?

and his ears .

who are you ?

it will be all right , madam .

ned , i swear i knew nothing of this !

how will it ?

the show must you know

no , it will turn out well .

what ?

i did not .

my tailor . wants to be an actor . i have a few debts here and there . well , that seems to be everybody . did you see a romeo ?

now where ? will ?

mr. henslowe , will you lend me fifty pounds ?

henslowe , you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate ?

this is a different one .

do you think ?

it would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master .

lady viola is pious , my lord .

oh , nurse ! he would give thomas kent the life of viola de lesseps 's dreaming .

from tomorrow , away in the country for three weeks ! is master shakespeare not handsome ?

your mother , and your father

all the men at court are without poetry . if they look at me they see my father 's fortune . i will have poetry in my life . and adventure . and love . love above all .

when the queen commands it .

oh , but they can !

above lord wessex ?

your majesty

your majesty .

lord wessex , as i foretold , has lost his wife in the play- house -- go make your farewell and send her out . it 's time to settle accounts . how much was the wager ?

i would have made you immortal . tell burbage he has lost a new play by will shakespeare .

luck be with you , sam . sam ?

master shakespeare

no , no , a touch of cold only . we suspect he is lying but will has turned away .

i am , master shakespeare .

i would not for the world !

`` oh then , dear saint , let lips do what hands to : they pray : grant thou , lest faith turn to despair . ''

`` ay pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer . ''

`` have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ? ''

as any mule in christendom . but if you are the man to rider her , their are rubies in the saddlebag .

but the plague

oh . what is your name ?

i was in a play . they cut my head off in titus andronicus . when i write plays , they will be like titus .

write me well .

orsinogood name

sold in marriage and half way to america .

an excellent beginning let him bea duke . and your heroine ?

it was we ourselves did that . and for my life to come i would not have it otherwise .

`` thou need'st not to be gone . ''

`` it was the lark , the herald of the morn , no nightingale . look , love , what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east . night 's candles are burnt out , and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops . i must be gone and live , or stay and die . ''

`` wilt thou be gone ? it is not yet near day > it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear . nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree . believe me , love , it was the nightingale . ''

you lie .

he was not dead before . i would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come .

you never spoke so well of him .

marlowe 's touch was in my titus andronicus and my henry vi was a house built on his foundations .

a literary feud . quite normal .

will ! what -- ?

to be the wife of a poor player ? -- can i wish that for lady viola , except in my dreams ? and yet i would , if i were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day .

yes , this is not life , will . this is a stolen season .

that 's my line !

it was the owl . believe me , love , it was the owl .

let him be damned for his pages !

oh

i do not know how to undress a man .

answer me only this : are you the author of the plays of william shakespeare ?

can you love a player ?

a lowly player .

my lady !

killed last night , in a tavern ! come , then , we 'll say a prayer for his soul

oh ! -- dear god , i did not think it would be me to tell you . a great loss to playwriting , and to dancing .

i understand of course . it is to be expected .

but why me ?

i do not love you , my lord .

no . i have spoken to the queen . her majesty 's consent is requisite when a wessex takes a wife , and once gained , her consent is her command .

i am aware of it , but it is beauty 's privilege .

it is , thomas , but of good reputation . come , there is no harm in a drink .

oh ! -- it 's -- it 's -- oh , it 's a house of ill- repute !

she sings too ?

deeper . softer . none of your twittering larks ! i would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song .

oh , thomas , her lips ! the early morning rose would wither on the branch , if it could feel envy !

oh , if i could write the beauty of her eyes ! i was born to look in them and know myself .

like a sickness and its cure together .

no , sir .

you upstart inky pup ! now i will show you your place , which is in hell !

an insolent penny-a-page rogue , marlowe , he said , christopher marlowe -- has he been to the house ?

a man , my lord ?

oh , my lord , you will not shake me off , she never needed me more , i sear by your breeches !

are you bringing your laundry woman ?

`` poet ? ''

about the mail --

but they know .

you 're sure ? there 's lots more .

what ? yes , that 's fine .

does n't it worry you ?

there was a break-in .

security .

i do n't know .

how much ?

i do n't know .

after you drink to love and happiness forever .

listen , it 's important . we need to talk about what we 're going to do --

not now . i have an idea .

yes . now come on , all or nothing .

we all are , david , we 're all going to do it . each of us , you , me and juliet , will do his or her bit . is that fair enough ?

do i ? what ? what ? what are you talking about ?

so who 's going to do it ?

a spade , we need a spade -- i wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we 're going to dig a pit .

you call them if you want .

all right , then , go ahead , telephone . telephone the police . try again . no one 's going to stand in your way . go ahead . tell them there 's a suitcase of money and you do n't want it .

you mean immoral .

only on expenses .

he made it clear .

squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination .

i 'd like to ask you about your hobbies .

i do n't know -- campbell or something ?

what 's his name ?

i do n't know .

cover it ?

right .

yes .

just one thing .

sorry to waste your time .

no , not any more . i just wondered if it would surprise you .

and if i told you their car was parked outside , would that surprise you ?

take another look at these two .

that 's because he is . does that upset you ?

it looks like he 's writing everything down .

nothing . we thought you were someone else .

what ?

good . well , you 've seen the flat ?

yes , thanks .

well , cameron , are you comfortable ?

stop him , alex . you 've got to stop him .

no .

that 's what i thought he said .

it makes us feel a whole lot better .

as smart as you are , you 'll need a little help .

everything .

you 'll wait in the hall ?

it 's the only way .

he is n't safe up there . if you really cared about him , you 'd use your influence to get him down , then he 'd be safe .

oh , good .

we have to talk .

looking after it -- he 's probably fucking well eating it .

he 's right . you 'd feel much better about it .

are you all right ?

sshh .

but you 're a doctor . you kill people every day .

i thought we all were .

no.the guy 's dead.what more do you need ?

hugo . hugo . sorry about this , but can you open the door ? it 's us , hugo , your flatmates and companions . your new-found friends . he 's not in . he 's left and we 'll probably never see him again .

his car 's still there .

david ?

so i gathered .

not usually this drunk .

i 'm not usually drunk .

so we 'll meet him , then ?

did you know --

ok , so a has left you , b is ambivalent , you 're still seeing c but d is the one you yearn for . what are we to make of this ? if i were you , i 'd ditch the lot . there 's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love .

and when did anyone last say to you these exact words : you are the sunshine of my life ' ?

when you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands , do you then summon hellfire ?

can you afford this place ?

that was n't a question .

no , they were asleep . they did n't even wake up .

yes , absolutely .

two ?

well , if you do , you 'll let us know ?

did you hear anything before he cries ?

it 's about the burglary .

what about ?

but i bet you did n't say you were going to split on him .

eh , i do n't know .

and you need your sleep .

we already know . all about it .

i thought you 'd gone to work .

that was stressful . i found that stressful .

i 've never seen a dead body before .

just get on with it , alex .

which is why i 'm trusting you with this account .

-- is often sneered at . are you aware of that ?

exactly what i was --

right here ?

that 's what i thought .

yeah , here , i mean , where else ?

that one , last week .

a little bit . is that good or bad ?

no .

yes , the telephone , but if it 's for me , i 'm not in . hugo you 're not in .

yeah . well , maybe i 'll change it .

what do you do ?

it 's nice .

would you like to come in ?

october 15th , direct flight , london heathrow to rio de janeiro , british airways , you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds . seven six five .

like recognizing criminals by their crimes .

and what do you recognize , names or faces ?

yes .

same as everyone else .

no . i have n't seen them .

i 'm sorry , i 've never seen any of them .

is it real ?

your watch .

you can tell by the intonation .

she 's a very groovy girl . that 's the problem .

do n't you think there 's too much gold ?

anyway , you remember harold ?

yeah , baby . things are great . listen , there 's devra , whatta you want ?

that girl 's making an awful spectacle of herself .

no , doll , i listen to you . and if a deal loses money that 's not so bad either if it 's handled right .

what ?

i 'm thinking of investing with him . he worries me .

who ?

do n't be silly . i 'll just tell lester we were smoking a couple of joints . see ?

and who 's jill ?

she 's a friend of jill 's .

no , that 's okay , i 'll do it now .

hi .

she 's fine . you really think i 'd be a good investment ?

hey , listen , baby , i 'm a star .

why do n't you see lester ?

what 're you doing later ?

i can see that .

i 'm not used to that kind of treatment .

-- i like myself far too much , far too much .

what ?

i 'm perfectly calm , george , i 'm simply saying you have no respect for me , that you 're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average hollywood ... mummers ...

i got ta talk to you .

i 've got ta give her some pills . percodan , she ran out .

so what are you doing going over there ? you 're not her doctor .

ruth lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer .

yeah , i think so .

i 'm not . i mean i 've got ta see this friend of mine for a few minutes .

my keys .

what 're you looking for ?

hello .

god , i adore you .

do n't worry , honey , i 'll protect you .

how do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked ? particularly in your business ... you deal with women every day ...

i guess so .

well , is she your girlfriend ?

you know what i 'm talking about .

you 're rude . i mean , you 're very rude .

nobody can hear it .

... what ? ...

oh , no .

yeah .

that you 're just like your mother .

then what do you think ?

no .

yeah ...

you live a phony cheap cop-out existence .

you think that 's funny , do n't you ?

no shit .

no kidding .

do n't make conversation with me .

making it with my mother ?

am i what ?

well , are you ?

c'mon , tell me . do n't be afraid .

c'mon , are you or are n't you ?

did you hear me ?

well , i do barbara rush .

what sort of references do you have ?

i guess not ...

right .

so you want to go in business for yourself ?

oh yes . mrs. shumann called about you .

you promised you 'd do the show .

i 've got heads here , norman .

yeah .

do n't leave me ...

what ?

what 's too late about it ? look , we 're not dead , are we ? that 's the only thing that 's too late .

no --

look -- either you leave or i leave because i do n't want the two of us here when lester arrives . i just do n't --

lester 's on his way .

i 've got to leave ?

-- well you better go after her .

why ?

-- what ?

-- well , if you feel like playing , go play ...

am i entertaining you ?

you were great .

fuckin ' a --

-- do n't you want to --

-- just get me out of here , baby . i ca n't stand it . it 's killing me .

he just completely ignores me . he could have at least said something , introduced me or something .

do n't do it .

you do n't do that anymore , do you ?

-- oh yeah ... what do you know about this guy ?

look , either come in or stay out !

sit down .

it 'll ruin everything .

yeah , baby ...

you just ca n't stand to miss one of them , can you ?

one of my few virtues is discretion .

now , baby ... if i told you about her ... then you could n't count on me not telling anymore ... could you ?

well , did you or did n't you ?

what ?

george ... how about felicia ?

i just have to do one little thing .

boy , that sauna is really ... ca n't you turn it down or something ?

and ?

... he tried to ... uh ... make it with me .

why not ?

do you ? you still see him ?

it 's hot in here .

yeah ... i mean great .

jill 's coming with us .

okay .

shut up , it 's all right . do you want a drink ?

i 'm sure .

how long you had this ?

so how 's norman ?

oh yeah ?

-- how did you get here ?

i do n't know if you do n't know --

that boy always does great . he 's a corporal or a squad leader or something , just wrote me from some place called kwang due ?

-- white ladies ?

-- you takin ' a lot of shit lately , george .

not yet .

that 's too bad .

what did you say ?

what did you say ?

george ...

-- tell me something -- did you talk about me ?

-- yes .

i wish you 'd go now .

... honest . at least you 're honest with me .

how ?

what difference does it make ?

so who else was there besides jackie ? huh ? ... huh ?

who knows , i 'm sure you do n't -- but if it 'll help any , i found it in your bed .

i 'd like you to leave now .

let go of me .

i do n't want to fight either . look ... uh -- i love you .

-- what ? -- i 'll see you later ...

-- go ahead .

what does he direct besides traffic ?

look at the way i live .

i 'll call you .

when i get off work .

when ?

just a second , i 'll be right with you ...

george .

i said i was n't sure if i could go .

great .

jill , say hello to felicia .

george .

george ?

you 've never even been around one .

we live together now .

hey , baby -- i 'm gon na retire with you .

i am ?

honey , what happened ?

right now -- i 'm at the epitome of my life . right now i feel so good i 'm afraid something 's gon na happen .

i do n't know . i ca n't remember . it was just in my dream .

i just ... who what ?

what 's gon na happen ?

you need a cut .

just a whore , i go over there , have a few drinks and get my gun off . i 'm through with her , she 's nothing but a whore .

what about jackie ?

oh yeah ...

who ?

hell of a way to treat a business partner , that 's all i can say .

okay , thanks .

do you think lorna hates her ? i do n't think she hates her . i mean she may resent her a little ...

i wan na hear it from you !

hey , have 'em put me away , or whatever you 're gon na do , okay ? ... i 'm too tired to lie , i 'm too tired to tell the truth ... i 'm too tired for anything .

godammit , george ...

yeah , i 'm unhappy with you about something .

you live like a pig .

this really ought to be layered ...

is n't that bad for it ?

well anyway ...

i know it , son . but tonight 's going to be even tougher .

oh yeah ?

okay .

well , george , you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me , but i invest for myself and a lot of particular people .

sure .

who needs that kind of aggravation ? who needs that kind of aggravation at my age ? when i finish work i want to ...

you 're right .

no , they 're a pain in the ass , there 's no way of keeping track of anything . it 's a cash business and you 've got to watch your operators or they 'll steal you blind , am i right or am i right ?

but what ?

well , yeah .

felicia says you 're a very good hairdresser .

all right , who 're you with ? jill ?

was n't sure it was you .



a soap ?

i do n't know . why do n't you ask him ?

they get hair all over the place .

you 're still jealous .

look ... you do well for people , they do n't ask you to stop . nobody wants you to stop making money , doll , not even uncle sam . they all want their share .

it 's very logical , it 's the most logical thing in the world . you would n't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner , and a little conversation and so forth ...

so i ca n't talk to some broken down actor , what do you think , i 'm going to tell him i 'm screwing lester karpf !

i 'm not jealous of the dogs .

i 'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody , i ca n't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you . you 're driving me up the wall , lester . you 're even jealous of the dogs . i mean i 've got ta have somebody i can talk to .

who do you think i was talking to ?

i called to tell you i was sending one over but the line was busy , you 're always on the phone .

no kidding ? your own shop ?

george is going to open a shop .

is that right ?

hi , leonard .

what did you do ?

... mmm-hmmm .

-- yesss ?

-- i guess i just blocked it out , that 's all .

jackie --

after four years ? no i do n't ... and i do n't know too many girls who do .

nothing .

do n't be silly .

jill , you 're a real sweetie pie . you really are . you 're sure you do n't mind ?

i guess not .

jill , i 'm just trying to be helpful .

i 'm not . maybe i am .

i am ? i mean why ?

i 'm telling you he wo n't know the difference .

johnny ! why did n't you tell me before ?

you mean when are you going to egypt ?

-- so when are you going to egypt ?

-- these bastards have me hemmed in .

-- why ?

-- oh i do n't know --

-- oh , sure . a hairdresser . how ... how do you a ... meet a hairdresser ?

what does he do ? is he an actor ?

johnny !

of course not ... he 's sort of a boyfriend .

well he 's not exactly a friend .

are you kidding ? his hair 's probably the most nutritious thing in here . see , you 've reduced me to eating weeds .

now i 'm embarrassed to tell you .

well , that 's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad .

that 's fine --

do you have children ?

no , it 's not that ...

you seem disappointed .

well we 'd love to , but we 're going to another party .

oh , say , how would you kids like to stop off for a drink ?

-- we 're going to be here all night .

everybody but us .

no , dad .

did your mother ever say that to you - that i would hurt you ?

good . i want you to like it here . i wish we could stay here for ever , and ever ... ever .

i guess so .

i ca n't . i have too much to do .

come here for a minute , first .

i 'm hungry .

yes ?

try to think what it was .

is tony the one that tells you things ?

chocolate it shall be . come on son .

yeah .

danny . danny , stop it . danny !

are you having a bad dream ?

i wo n't , mom .

come on , doc . he only went to bed a few hours ago . ca n't you wait till later ?

yeah .

oh what a maze . is n't it beautiful .

yeah .

does tony ever tell you to do things ?

to my stomach .

oh ,

what sort of injury did he have ?

did the appearance of danny 's imaginary friend ... ?

only about three months . eh we 're from vermont . my husband was teaching school there .

mrs. torrance , most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained . they are brought on by emotional factors , and they rarely occur again .

oh , yeah . oh , yeah , he seems absolutely fine now , but you should have seen him .

yes .

sure .

there 's nothing i look forward to with the greater pleasure , mr. grady .

will you indeed , mr. torrance .

your son has a very great talent . i do n't think you are aware how great it is , but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will .

no .

oh , they 're somewhere around . i 'm not quite sure at the moment , sir .

ah ha , it 's coming off now , sir .

have n't i seen you somewhere before ?

yes , sir .

fine .

sir , i 've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there ,

no problem , mr. ullman . i was just getting to the ice cream .

dick , if you 're ready to do it now , i think it would be a good idea if you could show mrs. torrance the kitchen , while i continue on with jack .

oh , that 's just great . how do you folks like our hotel so far ?

sure .

i would n't know what to do with it if i did .

it 's not a matter that concerns you , mr. torrance - at least not at this point .

no charge ?

how are things going , mr. torrance ?

that 's swell . i like you , lloyd . i always liked you . you were always the best of them .

your credit 's fine , mr. torrance .

go away .

wendy ...

go away from me .

give me the bat .

jack , stay away from me !

stay away from me !

i 'm not going to hurt you .

stay away from me !

stay away from me ,

do n't hurt me ! do n't hurt me !

why ?

get him out of here ?

no , nothing at all .

did you find anything ?

which room was it ?

i had ... i had the most terrible nightmare i ever had . it 's the most horrible dream i ever had .

yes .

i made 'em just the way you like 'em , sunny side up .

it 's about eleven thirty .

good morning , hon . your breakfast is ready .

yeah .

perfect for a child .

god , i 've never seen anything like this before . are all of these indian designs authentic ?

hi , hon . how 's it going ?

i 'd better collect my family first .

no , my son 's discovered the games room .

good . glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen . is your family having a look around ?

put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened .

well , my predecessor in this job

i do n't suppose they eh told you anything in denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970 ?

i 'm intrigued .

well , that sounds fine to me .

susie .

well , that 's very good time , very good . please sit down a minute .

oh , no problem at all . i made the trip in three and a half hours .

very nice to meet you .

it 's amazing how much activity is going on today .

how 're you getting on ?

hi .

oh , i 'll say .

this is the staff wing of the hotel . none of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter .

oh well they 're really gorgeous . as a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel i 've ever seen .

bill , would you have the torrances ' things brought in their apartment .

well , that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first .

eight thirty .

jack is going to take care of the overlook for this winter . i would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through .

holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-jesus-christ !

all except my legs ... i do n't think i can walk .

are you all right , marty ?

jane-

will you marry me , jane ?

jane , i have to talk to you .

where 's mom ?

yes . go away .

stop it !

what do you expect , when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed ?

you always take his side because he 's a cripple ! well , it 's not my fault that he 's a cripple !

well , it 's probably nothing . i 'm just spooked since ... you know .

what ?

there 's something else scary .

i used to see her every day , and she never knew what was going to happen to her , and neither did i ! i mean i know how stupid that sounds , but ...

what if i say no ?

but uncle al ! you said-

no one knows how cancer begins , either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it .

you 're not going to let it go , are you ?

what about father lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down ? you do n't think that was a dream , do you ?

i 'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription . and i 'll bet you another quarter he has n't said anything to mr. haller .

she and dad are out back lighting the barbecue . jane 's walking around like she 's king shit of turd mountain . like always .

it 's just an outward symbol of everything that 's inwardly wrong in this town . not bad , huh ? i read sherwood anderson in college . i can jive that shit all day .

yeah , okay , the fireworks . jane thinks that 's all i 'm mad about , but it 's not . them doing that is just a ... a ...

it is n't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed brady . now he 's got them to cancel the fair .

no .

there 's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick . you ever hear that one ?

let the boy finish the game , nan .

ralph houk ! you ca n't bet a manager ! stone the crows !

and do n't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come !

remember , al ... we 'll be at the ritz-carlton in boston tomorrow night ! or at the funeral parlor . it 's stickney and-

perhaps .

well ... thank you .

yeah , you learned a whole lot , i can tell .

were you tempted ?

by a voice you hear from on high

so , hi there . i 'm ... sister mary clarence . and you 're ... young christians . i guess i should assign you this passage . what 's good ? what were you talking about ?

okay , christy -- strip .

with love .

his ashes ?

she 's afraid . come on , tell the boys you 're afraid .

thanks . a lot .

he said that if i got a divorce i 'd burn in hell . for all eternity .

today was the deadline , vince .

vince ...

who ? the other woman . your wife .

what is it , betty ?

pay attention ...

my soul was in danger i 'd fallen from grace

jackpot ! two buckets

because we 're

the dixie cups ? oh my . i was just a girl . of course . spring is here the sun will shine

mary patrick -- do you remember the dixie cups ?

it 's a rhythm section . the beat .

that machine .

two days . an hour or so .

hold on .

sure is ! come on in , and sing a spell .

well , it all comes back , in just a jiffy . i 'm working on a wall-hanging , of the convent .

the minute i saw you . i said to myself , she 's a weaver . have you ever used a loom ?

where did that come from ?

hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one . why do i suddenly feel like snow white ?

do n't look at your feet , and i do n't want to see anybody counting . make it look easy . again !

tell me about it .

very nice . sisters , have we learned our lesson ? i wo n't hold this little episode against anyone . i 'll try not to .

what ?

free-lance ? oh really ? you think i do n't see ? you think i took vows yesterday ? i know what you 're up to . you and reverend mother .

sure . kind of ... free-lance .

um , i do n't really know this one ...

mary clarence , are you with us ?

whatever .

shirelles .

i like my old convent , in vancouver . out in the woods . it was n't all modern , like here . no electricity . cold water . bare feet . those were nuns . it was hell on earth , but i loved it . this place is a hilton .

like this place ?

what did he say ?

bless you .

but what do they want ? where are we going ?

they 're from my old convent .

we 're nuns !

honor thy mother and thy father too do n't kill , do n't steal , it 's bad for you

now stop that . you did n't shoot at me . you were only trying to help , to give me experience . i tried to explain that to reverend mother , but -- i do n't know if she understood .

mary robert , i am so sorry about last night ...

keep moving !

mary clarence ! you 're so ... different from the other sisters . sometimes , well ... sometimes you sound more like a layperson .

good point . especially that dude you were with . i 'd like to see him down front .

those people are wonderful ! why do n't we ever see them in church ?

you watch yourself !

who are all these people ?

experience ! right ?

it 's part of st. katherine 's new community outreach program . how old are you ? you should n't be smoking . have you ever seen a diseased lung ? hand 'em over .

we need experience .

mary clarence !

reverend mother says you need experience , right , in life . in order to make a responsible decision . this is going to be very painful for me . you know how much i love this little room . this whole convent . wait .

she says i should wait . she says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life . she says that i 'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet . in a mature manner .

oh . mary clarence , i 'm so unworthy . i want to take my final vows , i would do it tomorrow , but reverend mother wo n't let me !

you have to help me

an extra heel of bread . please take it , you need your strength . you 've been working so hard .

come on , we 're late .

do n't push it .

you have evidenced great maturity , mary robert . we shall have a serious discussion .

saving you . move !

you and i know that life is not so simple . there will be disappointments . rude shocks . and you will have vanished . how ... fortunate .

indeed . after how long ? a few weeks ? i have been here thirty years . and yet , it would seem , i know nothing .

i have submitted my resignation to bishop o'hara . privately . i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible .

what ?

hey -- your prayers have been answered . i 'm leaving . in just a couple of days .

the council of cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire catholic church . they command the utmost respect . your more ... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place .

hold on . that 's not fair . i worked hard with them . they gave up their free time , and they loved it . those women are happy . and we can get even better . we can wake this place up .

exactly . people like going to theaters and casinos . but they think church is for grandma -- we could change that . pack the joint .

i was thinking las vegas . get some butts in those seats .

you have , i believe , some minimal background in music . therefore , you are to join our choir .

what ?

i know ! i 'm sorry i did n't mean for it to happen ! and i was the one they were shooting at !

months of work , and the loom , absolutely ruined !

good . mary patrick , i need you in the office . mary clarence , carry on .

in english ?

deal with it , sweet thing . it 's important , nowadays . you just practice at home , with a balloon and a banana .

i got it .

girls , this is sister mary clarence . she 'll be minding you until sister mary patrick 's return . mary clarence , please assign a biblical passage . do not attempt discussion . am i understood ?

it 's like the stone age . the room time forgot . what about a phone ?

you were right the first time . is this like , solitary ? the cooler ? where 's the furniture ?

surely you are familiar with this practice , mary clarence . only when our lips are silent , can our prayers truly be heard .

and the vow of chastity .

like to who ?

mary clarence ? like a guy ? like a dumb guy ?

but look at rites look at this ! i 'm a nun ! i 'm invisible ! i 'm a penguin !

can do .

i joined this convent some thirty years ago . at that time , the world knew some measure of peace . and hope . our order was a beacon of hospitality , to families , to children , to a neighborhood filled with promise . and , as the years have passed , i have watched that promise destroyed . drugs . gangs . spandex . and . so i have made this convent an oasis , a retreat from horror . and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls .

your cigarette -- out .

sit down .

you see ? you see ? i have to get out of here i have to make a phone call . do n't you get it ? i 'm in a convent ! you 're a nun !

the reason ?

enough joking .

a convent ? they put me in a convent ? what 's the problem ? was n't there any more room in hell ?

yeah , eddie , thanks a whole bunch . thanks for sticking me in a convent . so you think , after all this , maybe i really am a nun ?

you do n't get it ! it 's a big thing for them , it 's like ... caesar 's palace . prime-time . they 're singing for the cardinals . it 's like ... `` star search . '' if first prize was a trip to the vatican . they 've worked really hard , they deserve this .

eddie -- i 've got to go back . they wo n't sing without me . i 'm deserting them .

vince knows you 're here .

just remember - you 're a target . do n't you think vince has a t.v . ?

i have ?

no . most of the time i 'm thinking about you . and now ... you 've really changed .

me too .

yeah . you look ... great . i mean it..

what if i was vince ? you 'd be dead right now . what are you doing giving interviews on tv ?

but it 's a nightmare ! mother superior is out to get me ! she hates my guts ! she keeps thinking up new kinds of torture !

like what ?

everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent . nobody knows you 're here but me . we 're trying to get a quick court date . a month , maybe two , tops . i 'll spring you as soon as i can .

safest place in the world . you think vince would look for you here ?

no nothing .

jesus , what do you think this is -- wheel of fortune ? let me spell it out for you . you have to hide like you do n't even exist . you have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight .

ten flights ?

i do n't know anything about bodies ! i mean , he did n't bring it home . he was good to me ... sometimes . he was sweet . he took care of me . who am i supposed to go out with ? he owns a casino . he let me sing .

he 's a businessman .

from vince ? what a guy . doo-lang , doo- lang .

people throw stones . they call me names . i mean , really .

jerusalem is a real drag . everybody hates me .

vince is getting desperate . where is she , eddie ? where 'd you stash her ?

i 'm telling you !

but you did n't tell me !

she 's a broad ! got it ! just some broad !

where is she ?

well ?

yeah ...

you know so much . they 've got christy , and we 've got to find her . get her 8x10 , from in front of the lounge . fax it to every contact we got .

it 's a bluff , vince .

what 's she doing ?

and then we can ice her . no nun , no evil eye .

you did n't shoot !

no smart-ass remarks or nothing .

that should have tipped us .

dress rehearsal at four , performance at 8:30. sharp .

however , we can also pray for other things .

peace on earth .

she told us about one . the little sisters of the moonlight . in las vegas .

oh , she 's doing just fine , reverend mother -

mary clarence -- how is your weaving progressing ?

yes ?

reverend mother , on behalf of the sisters , i 'd like to welcome mary clarence to st. katherine 's .

impossible .

christy .

a benedictine .

well , i do n't care who she is . we ca n't sing without her !

an ... entertainer ?

you mean -- they kidnapped her ?

it 's brought people back to the church .

it 's better than ice cream .

he 's not like other guys .

we did it ! we actually sang a chord !

reverend mother ?

st. katherine 's is a benedictine order . you have taken a vow of hospitality . to all in need .

she 's a nun , vince .

i mean , wo n't she talk ? she seemed kind of upset .

clergyman steenwyck is calling a meeting . this time he is determined to have you forced out , or worse .

um ... i ... i did not ... no . why ?

who took the meat ?

then , name one person who has seen him with their own eyes .

i say ... if the horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people , he 's solid enough to feel this ...

i fired upon the horseman and the bullet did nothing .

two days ... ? for murder ?

they spend two days in chains .

never . a shoe that size i would have remembered .

what the hell are you doing ?

excuse me , miss ... they have a laugh at your expense .

what of it ?

no bleeding .

excuse me ?

wallowing quite literally in blood .

they need guidance .

oh ? far as i can tell , a rumor does not travel alone for long here .

no . you will not run me out . no one will believe a word of what you say .

for poaching . or , would you remake our laws now that magistrate philipse has given up the ghost ?

then , you should have left two days ago , because i have men willing to help me today .

i will not allow it . i will not !

perhaps , i could assist in finding them ?

i have everything ... last testaments ... birth certificates , death certificates ... deeds .

do you have these persons ' wills ?

pardon me ?

taken . taken by the headless horseman . taken back to hell .

excellent . then , you are excused till morning .

for one who calls himself a federalist , your mouth reeks of republican liberalism .

without disrespect , look around you . we overflow . as do our courts .

our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence , but if we were more often able to ensure justice , after the fact , then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement .

just a moment ... if i may . it is possible this man was murdered .

is that all you say ? look at her .

no , you listen ! you may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards ...

listen to what you say ... .

not more than a year ago , a mob hung a man for stealing a horse . for stealing a horse ! and , you dig up our dead .

he would not have gone into the western woods . no sane man would .

well , constable ... are you aware ... to be honest , you are not what we expected . we sent for the militia .

i doubt that 's the end .

what now ?

take the reins .

what can we do ?

take me with you . there 's nothing left for me here .

i need time for thinking . without you hanging on my coattails for a change .

there are no other doors . this is as far as she could have gone .

baltus van tassel .

what does it mean ?

and it now belongs to you , according to baltus . i heard him say it .

we should go .

then , who murdered the old crone ? and why ?

true enough .

how could something named `` the tree of the dead '' fail to draw attention ?

follow the indian trail to where the sun dies . to the tree of the dead . maybe we passed it by .

no crickets or cicadas calling . no bird songs .

listen .

what kind of nuts ?

up .

i deserve to help you . do n't you see how much this means ? my father ... he ... he was a good man ...

i am not here for revenge . i am here to bring justice .

katrina ...

the name van tassel is blackened . you share that name .

i have not been able to face him yet .

what did he say , katrina ?

i have been reading your journal . i 'm sorry . i found it too fascinating to resist . i rode to catch up with you at the notary , out of curiosity . before i found you though , i overheard what you were said .

yes . i did notice that , thank you .

my god ... what has happened ?

but , i am not alone , am i ? i only wished to see what you were up to , and ... to thank you .

memories have come back . i had them forgotten , and wish i could forget them again ... but they are here now . lord , how i hate this place .

she died . her lungs were diseased ... two years ago . what is this about ?

what ?

what has happened ?

if it had been surgery on a living person , done to save that person 's life , you would not question it . not for a moment . so , let me be the first to tell you , dear girl ... on the other side of these sheltering mountains , a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours . and someday , no matter how much you fear it , that world will come to roust sleepy hollow out of its slumber .

must i hear this ?

what are you on about ?

people have put their trust in you .

if you want . but ...

i , um ... i have something to show you , if you have a moment .

may i ask ... why do you cover your book that way ?

poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions .

really ? then ... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom , or even in a teardrop ?

to call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic , but not all magic is black .

are you so superstitious ?

i 've read a great deal about your new york city . do be a dear and tell me all about it . sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life .

my suitor ?

perhaps it is because your suitor 's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat .

it might have been more . might have been positively grand talk .

did they tell ? it is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone . according to the elders , an indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken , and spells cast then still linger to this day .

it appears well . it has already clotted .

she has taken the last of our grain to be milled . you do have a background in the medical arts , do n't you , constable ?

no . she has gone out .

excuse me , lady van tassel ... katrina is not in her room .

use caution .

returning to the western woods ?

yes . here ...

van ripper ... do you have a gun ?

turn around . now !

what did you say ?

i did n't see none .

you want to see into the nether world ... i can show you . whatever you see , do not move or speak . i will hold him .

can you help ?

the horseman . yes .

the lenape who lived in these woods ... do you know him ? the redman ? i should tell you ... he has been murdered .

father saw you die .

doctor , he is awake .

she has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession . do you know what confession is ? all that is left for you now is to pray for her soul .

no , sir , please ... she is innocent ...

there was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss , one old boy from california and one old boy from arkansas . old boy from california says , `` boy this water 's cold . '' old boy from arkansas says `` yeah , and it 's deep too . '' get it ? that 's a goodun .

he does make some funny noises .

let 's go , vaughan . frank , we 'll be back in a little while . i 'll bring you back somethin ' . you 're food 's in the oven warmin ' over .

you sure are hung up on people bein ' sweet . speakin ' of which , where 's your girlfriend ? i thought he was comin ' by here for something .

he 's just mentally retarded , i guess .

i hate you !

goddamnit , i 'm talkin ' to the man . you set right there , karl .

i want to watch t.v .

you might want to find out . he might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin ' .

no sir 's right . i 'm talkin ' to your mama . this is your mama 's decision , not yours . i 'm lettin ' it go on because she asked me , not you . now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that , 'cause i have trouble eatin ' around that kind of thing . just like i am about antique furniture and midgets . i ca n't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture . same thing with a droolin ' retard .

no sir .

well , honey , i do n't guess i give a shit . i ai n't here half the time anyway . if you want a retard livin ' in the garage , i do n't guess i care . i 've got a good tool box and socket set out there i do n't want stol 'd . i guess i could take it home with me .

i 'll kill you , you fuckin ' faggot ! you mind your own business . now get out ! now , before i get too mad to turn back .

it 's not your house , doyle , it 's linda 's .

i do n't really understand the meaning of the words .

what exactly do you mean by that ? i do n't understand .

i bet you like sittin ' between two men in a dual wheel truck do n't you ?

are you sure you can drive ? you 've really had a lot of alcohol .

come on , do n't be a pussy . everybody has to work .

you enjoying yourself , karl ?

how does a feller go about gettin ' ahold of the police ?

you shut up you , fuckin ' retard . get your shit and get out of here . that was a wake-up slap , frank . remember . reality , like i said . do n't forget any bit of what i said to you and we 'll be fine .

do n't hit that boy no more .

baptized ? well , get baptized then . i do n't give a shit . call a fuckin ' preacher , goddamnit ! i ca n't baptize you .

karl childers just in from the state facility . make one of them gruntin ' sounds karl or whatever it is you do . oh well , karl 's a little retarded , he do n't know what the hell i 'm talkin ' about . and to vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients . now that takes balls . our number one tune for the folks , boys . kick it off johnson !

you 're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then . it would n't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause i ai n't afraid of shit . you think i 'm afraid for you to stay here . you 're just a humped over retard it looks like to me . not really , i 'm just jokin ' with you . welcome to our humble home , buddy . frank needs all the friends he can get . frank 's a real weak little kid . his daddy taught him how to be a pussy .

well , i ca n't understand none of it . this one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another . just how retarded are you ?

different ones . the bible 's one of 'em .

this and that . toothpaste and whatnot .

what 's in your bag ?

i 'm closing the door now . i told you , i 'll see you later .

frank , i just like you as a friend . only at the secret place . okay ? i ca n't go there now . i 'll see you later .

okay . i give you my word . is ever'thing gon na be okay ? are you all right ?

i 've got a feelin ' today .

i aim fer you to have 'em .

you have to karl . you have to look out for me . you do n't let that son of a bitch run you off .

just diggin ' . i ai n't ever gon na be happy now . not with that son of a bitch movin ' in for good . i wish me and you and mama could just run away . but she said he would find us wherever we went . he 's crazy . sometimes i think it would of been better if i wad n't ever born .

hey , karl . how 'd you know to come out here ?

yes ma'am . i like a fried chicken leg .

if i ai n't too stove up . i ai n't like you . i 'm old and give out . i 'm proud of ye .

make believin ' always made me feel good too from time to time .

bible says the same thing about killin ' others , too .

so it died when it come out ?

i do n't reckon i know .

you do n't seem like a daddy . you seem like a brother . wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you do n't even know 'em like what happened with me and you .

yes sir . you ort not know that language .

oh , jackin ' off ?

pull on your works . your privates .

naw .

yeah , i reckon they did . hit like to tore me up when i read about that pore little cripple boy .

boy , folks sure had it rough back a long time ago , did n't they ?

that gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin ' with her .

hey karl , you off work ?

i like the way you talk .

were they bad people ?

'cause he did n't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to . that 's what the letter said . he got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs . i thought he took care of us fine . karl , did you really kill somebody ?

it ai n't the truth . he shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose .

how come her to keep bein ' girlfriends and all with him if he 's mean to her ?

i 've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died . sometimes i wish i was still real little and he was still here . my mama 's real good , but i wish i had both of 'em . when we went to memphis one time in the car , it was rainin ' so hard we could n't see the road . but i wad n't scared because i thought as long as daddy was drivin ' nothin ' could happen to us . i feel that way about mama now . mama has a boyfriend now . his name is doyle hargraves . he works construction so he makes a pretty good livin ' . he still do n't help mama out with any money though . he ai n't no good . he 's mean to her . he do n't like me at all . mama says it 's because he 's jealous i belong to my daddy instead of him . he stays with us all night sometimes , but he 's got his own house . somebody told me it 's so he can still have other girlfriends . i like it on the nights when he ai n't at our house . i 'm not so nervous then .

my mother 's dead . my daddy 's s'posed to be around still . he do n't want to have nothin ' to do with me though .

they still around , your folks ?

i ai n't no good at it . i just come by .

you told me to come by .

hey there . i thought i heard somebody on the porch . was n't your name karl ?

do you like to play football ?

how come you 're carryin ' them around with you .

well , at least he 's tryin ' . but who knows for how long .

i promise we 're gon na get away from him . the time has to be right , that 's all . i 'd rather him get tired of me and leave me . then he would n't want to hurt me . he would n't care then . we 'll be fine . i promise . you go to bed now . i love you .

no , honey , we do n't . i 'll make some coffee and start cleanin ' up this mess . karl , you want some coffee , huh ?

he ai n't ever okay to me .

he 's no more an indian than i am though . anyhow , doyle 's gon na try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends . just like he does to frank and me sometimes . you just ignore it . or stay out here away from 'em if he 'll let you . he 's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he 'll get drunk . i guarantee it .

they ai n't even no good . the only one can play is randy horsefeathers . he claims he 's an indian . his real name 's randy collins and he works at the feed mill . he can at least play guitar .

i do n't know . he just said he 'd eat out there .

oh , that 's karl . i met him at the laundrymat . karl , this is my mama . and vaughan , vaughan 's the manager . he lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they 're best friends .

flowers is pretty . i 've always thought that .

i ai n't really thought about it too much i do n't reckon .

i like walkin ' quite a bit from time to time .

i told you , i ai n't got no boy , now get on out from here and let me be .

they turned me aloose from the nervous hospital . said i was well .

i ai n't got no boy .

i ai n't got no boy .

do they know about you ?

well , you ca n't do that . you 're a free man . you 've been let out to do as you please .

i want to come back and stay here .

karl , what in the world are you doing here ?

thank ye . i 'm just getting around to tellin ' you , but i fixed your warshin ' machine .

ma'am ?

where 'd he go ? what 's goin ' on ?

no ma'am . i 'm a'goin ' off sommers .

i killed my mother and a old boy name jesse dixon . i thought they was a-doin ' wrong . i was about your boy 's age . they say i 'm well now from it .

hit ai n't right for me to keep from tellin ' you how come me to be put in the state hospital .

mustard 's good on 'em to me .

i 'll be dog .

karl , this is my boyfriend , doyle . frank , why do n't you and karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin ' . vaughan , you ready to go ?

this evenin ' i want you to go get mizz wheatley and that frank and have them stay with you tonight .

okay .

i ai n't a-stayin ' . i need to ast you fer a favor .

before that i was thinkin ' it 'd be good if i could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry .

i was thinkin ' i could use me another helpin ' of these potaters .

i done et just a little bit ago .

quite a spell , i reckon .

yes sir .

do you have family here ?

it 's been here seventeen years . did you live here before or something ?

i 'm sorry .

what about me ?

he 's been in the state hospital a long time , something must be wrong with him .

he just got out of the state hospital .

no , we have to get this story .

yeah .

do you smell shit ?

as much as anybody else is , i guess . y'all have a good rest of the day now .

we 've got some paperwork to take care of . pretty soon . do n't worry , you wo n't run into him in the parking lot .

is he leaving right this minute ?

he 's free . his time 's up . that 's the rules . he 's been treated and reevaluated . he does n't show any signs any more .

that 's really strange . what does it mean ?

i do n't know what to tell you . i 'm sorry . i made myself pretty clear i thought . he probably got busy and was n't thinking . i know how that is . i used to teach shop and eighth grade science .

karl 's real sensitive about having his picture made . he would n't even be on the bulletin board for the easter collage . melvin , would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes ? you girls want some coffee ?

nice to meet you . i 'm marsha dwiggins and this is theresa evans . she 's here to take the pictures .

also , melinda , please do n't tell anybody at the store that albert was here tonight , okay .

no wonder it 's such a screwed-up place .

ah-hah , i see . a cozy dinner . but are n't threesomes a little awkward ? how does the phrase go --

perhaps i should rephrase the question . what i mean to say is , are you married or seriously involved with a significant other ?

i finished my story . i thought you might want to take a look at it .

i 'll tell you all about it ... ... but not here .

of course i fool around . but not so much when it comes to my work , it 's true . have you ever read pierre , or the ambiguities ?

your dissertation ? what subject do you study ?

until she was twelve . she moved here in 'forty-nine .

i thought i recognized you . you 're paul benjamin the writer , are n't you ?

will that be cash or charge ?

what 's the difference ?

next time , when you want two corned beef sandwiches , say , `` two corned beef sandwiches . '' when you want two ginger ales , say , `` two ginger ales . ''

do me a favor , will you ?

what about for you ?

and what about for you ?

anything for art , eh , paul ?

it was a good deed , auggie . it was a nice thing you did for her .

she probably died .

i have to pee . if the waiter comes , order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale , okay ?

it does n't have to be true . it just has to be good .

anything good ?

you usually get two .

hey , man , how 's it going ?

not a peep .

it could have been worse . if the cops had n't come , i might not be standing here now .

help ? hmm . it 's possible . what did you have in mind ?

hey , auggie , i 've just been thinking . you would n't need some help around the store , would you ? some summer help while vinnie 's gone ?

it 's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little .

they 're all the same , but each one is different from every other one . you 've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings . you 've got your summer light and your autumn light . you 've got your weekdays and your weekends . you 've got your people in overcoats and galoshes , and you 've got your people in shorts and t-shirts . sometimes the same people , sometimes different ones . and sometimes the different ones become the same , and the same ones disappear . the earth revolves around the sun , and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle .

that 's right . more than four thousand pictures of the same place . the corner of 3rd street and seventh avenue at eight o'clock in the morning . four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather . that 's why i can never take a vacation . i 've got to be in my spot every morning . every morning in the same spot at the same time .

i did n't know you took pictures .

the boys and i were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars . some interesting connections there , do n't you think ?

hey , auggie . how 's it going ?

what 's this ?

she 's just a kid . there 's time for more babies later . after she grows up .

so you 're just going to give up and go home ?

you told me you wanted to meet him . well , here he is .

yeah , like what ?

i told her she was going to meet her father .

dammit , auggie , do n't ask so many questions . just get in the car .

where to ?

just get in and shut up . i 'm not asking you to do anything . i just need you to come with me .

who the hell knows ? he dropped out of sight fifteen years ago .

it was over with bill before you ever came home . maybe you do n't remember it now , but you were pretty hot to see me back then .

i do n't know who else to turn to , auggie .

help , huh ? and i do n't suppose this help has anything to do with money , does it ?

like what you 're doing . i 'm not going to eat you up . i need your help , and if you keep staring at me like that . i might start screaming .

this is private , auggie . just between you and i .

okay , my man . love to the wife and kids , et cetera , et cetera . drop me a postcard if you can remember the address .

enjoy it while you can , vin . pretty soon , they 're going to legislate us out of business anyway .

lovely .

yeah , i know . to that girl who moved to pittsburgh .

your job ? you 've got five thousand bucks . what do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for ?

come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we 'll talk about it , okay ? we 'll see what we can work out .

does it hurt ?

sure , auggie , i got it . the store 's closed . and when do i tell them it 's open ?

damned if i know . but it has a nice ring to it , do n't it ?

what does that mean ?

thanks for the tip .

the refrigerator ?

a good choice . you would n't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers , would you ? remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out .

you mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind ?

and ?

and you told your nephew about it ?

his mother 's dead , and he has n't seen his father in twelve years .

i always knew that boy had an imagination , but now he 's gone and made up a whole new life for himself . do you mind if i sit down ? he 's been living with me and his uncle henry since he was a baby . and we do n't live in manhattan . we live in boerum hill . in the projects .

and what was he doing here in the first place ? that 's what i want to know . what 's a man like you messing around with a black boy like thomas for ? are you some kind of pervert , or what ?

rashid ? rashid ! is that what he told you his name was ?

you mean rashid ?

i 'm telling you . i do n't know anyone named thomas .

do n't give me any of that . i know he 's been here . you ca n't fool me , mister .

the damn lock 's broken again . and so you just barge in on strangers , is that what you do ? is that your game ?

i just want to know what your game is , mister , that 's all .

you shut your mouth ! you shut your mouth now !

i do n't like this . i do n't like it one bit .

paul . rashid . thomas . which one is it ?

it 's only temporary . on a freelance basis .

the name is cyrus cole .

once you look at it , you 're going to want to buy it from me . that 's guaranteed . and that 's the price : five bucks . so if you 're not willing to spring for it , you might as well not bother to look . it 'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable .

it 'll cost you five bucks .

just passing through .

i 'm not going to rob you , mister . do i look like a thief ?

help ? what the fuck do i need your help for ? i 've got a man , do n't i ? that 's more than you can say for yourself , hawkeye .

well ?

i do n't know , tommy . you think anyone gives a rat 's ass about kuwait ? i read something about the head sheik over there . he marries a different virgin every friday and then divorces her on monday . you think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that ?

of course there 's gon na be a war . you think they 'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun ? i mean , there 's plenty of beach , but not a hell of a lot of water . half a million soldiers . it ai n't no seaside holiday , you can bet on that .

i used to smoke raleigh cigarettes . they came with a free gift coupon in every pack .

they did n't have to do a thing , that 's all i 'm saying . the team was good , the best fucking team in baseball . but then they had to screw it up . they traded their birthright for a mess of porridge . a mess of porridge .

huh ?

fuck you , too , you white son-of-a-bitch .

i pay auggie , and i 've got nothing . eight hundred bucks and a ticket to shit city .

what are you talking about ? you ca n't be serious .

here 's what you 're going to do . you 're going to open up your backpack , take out your bag of money , count out five thousand dollars , and hand it over to auggie .

no way . there 's no way i 'm giving that money back . it 's my money now .

good thinking .

not exactly . i mean , there was more to it than i told you .

i do n't know .

you do n't believe me , huh ? look , i 'll show you . it 's all in this book .

his only copy ?

it 's 1942 , right ? and he 's caught in leningrad during the siege . i 'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history . five hundred thousand people died in that one place , and there 's bakhtin , holed up in an apartment , expecting to be killed any day . he has plenty of tobacco , but no paper to roll it in . so he takes the pages of a manuscript he 's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes .

excuse me for asking , but you are n't married , are you ?

here we are . rembrandt 's drawings . edward hopper . van gogh 's letters .

i mean earlier . we could have planned something .

hey , hey . happy birthday . why did n't you tell me ?

just so you do n't overdo it . you do n't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish .

once a story gets hold of you , it 's hard to let go . besides , i 'm making up for lost time .

maybe . or maybe it 's the other people who do n't belong .

what makes you think you 'll be any safer around here ? it 's only about a mile away from where you live .

i just happened to be walking by ... all of a sudden , the creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands ... they just about ran smack into me . the creeper recognized me , and i knew he knew i recognized him ... if the guy from the check-cashing place had n't rushed out then screaming bloody murder , he would have shot me . i 'm telling you , the creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk . but the noise distracted him , and when he turned around to see what was happening , i took off ... one more second , and i would have been dead .

so that 's the something you were n't supposed to see , huh ?

i crossed paths with him . that 's why i 'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood . to make sure i do n't run into him again .

i do n't have much time .

business appointment . i 'm seeing my broker at three o'clock .

i bought it . twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at goldbaum 's tv and radio . well , that just about takes care of it , i guess . you 'll be able to watch the ball games . you know , as a little break from your work .

appreciation for what ?

i wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation .

you too . and make sure the light is green before you cross the street . oh , by the way , i liked your book . i think you 're a hell of a good writer .

you do n't have to apologize . the coast is probably clear now anyway .

no hard feelings , okay ? it 's a small place , and i ca n't get my work done with you around .

it sounds like our time is up , does n't it ?

i did n't ask to come here . you invited me , remember ? if you want me to leave , all you have to do is say so .

eight-thirty ?

eight-thirty .

yeah , sometimes . i like to dabble , too .

twelve , thirteen years ago . actually , he died with his sketch pad open on his lap . up in the berkshires one weekend , drawing a picture of mount greylock .

no , he was a schoolteacher . but he liked to dabble .

suit yourself . but if you change your mind , here 's the address .

thanks , but i 'll manage .

i 'm not `` people . '' i 'm just me . and i do whatever i goddamn want to do . got it ?

the what . i 've kind of run away from home , you see . it has nothing to do with my parents or money . i saw something i was n't supposed to see , and for the time being it 's best that i keep myself out of sight .

the what ?

of course . where else ?

and where do momsie and popsie live ?

just one bottle . i believe in moderation .

you must eat lunch pretty early . it 's only eleven o'clock .

that 's okay . i 've already had lunch .

i do n't drink coffee . on the other hand , since you insist , if you offered me a cold lemonade . i would n't say no .

that 's all right . if i think of something , i 'll send my butler over to tell you .

you have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance .

it 's okay , mister . no big deal .

watch out , man . you 'll get yourself killed like that .

i 'll take the iced coffee . you only live once , right ?

i am a bastard . i 'm a big hun nazi son of a bitch . and i still got your bamboo fishing rod .

i 'm a hemotologist , not a detective .

no , but as i say , the type is rare . ten percent of caucasian males .

so the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all . it was < u > human < /u > , yes ? type b positive .

but back in '34 , japanese-born could not < u > own < /u > land . so ... ?

so that makes what would have been $ 4500 into $ 7000 , does n't it ? if you sent the equity back , you had a profit of $ 2500 .

second question . what did ole jurgensen pay you per acre ?

now , how is miyamoto gon na know in < u > advance < /u > ? that carl loses two batteries . must happen once ever ' 20 years or so .

compressed air horn , most likely . hope to god some man hears you in that fog .

no sense to have < u > any < /u > at all. , even the right size . it 's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car . nobody does .

now the sheriff believed that the d-6 battery in carl 's well was carl 's own spare . even though it was too large f ...

i 'm sorry about that . it was n't mine in the first place .

you 're implying th ...

does n't it seem to < u > you < /u > , mrs. miyamoto , that your mistake was in being deceitful ? concealing information during the course of a sheriff 's investigation .

well , it seems to me ...

but if truth was on your side , whatever were you worried about ?

closer to eight .

we hear how carl ... passed away . only a few hours later .

i said 'excited ' . not agitated , he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed .

you have to hear this , i can never touch you , ishmael . not once , not ever . there 's no half- way . as much as i know it hurts you , you have to let this go .

there ca n't be any wrong in this , ha ...

why ? we 're only talking .

we 're japanese , not mexican , ishmael . he 'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword .

they 're not his neighbor , like you are . he is a husband , a father , he risked his < u > life < /u > for < u > their < /u > country . the same as you .

agnostics do n't believe or disbelieve , ma . we just do n't pretend we know .

what else ? i had the boy teach me kendo . including ... the importance of the bow .

well , what then , sergeant ?

and you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat .

pretty darn clear .

you bet . and if miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off , he coulda left this line behind on carl 's boat .

so if defendant had tied up to deceased 's boat . with that last one . would those cleats have lined up ?

and the last ... ?

and the next one ... ?

your honor , < u > all < /u > of this is speculation . including mr. hooks ' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call .

all right . what did your son < u > say < /u > to that effect ?

objection . asking witness to speculate about deceased 's state of mind .

no , sir , i ca n't . not beyond a reasonable doubt .

that 's how journalists . answer questions .

he did n't want to lose any more .

oh , yes .

should have told 'everything ' . meaning , you should have told the < u > truth < /u > .

as my wife testified , we were considering it .

you have the night watch ? on the radio .

it 's on the twine , too . but it 's not r ...

here now , what are you fixin ' to do ?

it 's public record . if the public cares enough to read it .

i did . boy .

you think so ?

still and all . carl was a strong swimmer , he m ...

the knife . what knife ?

but you < u > could < /u > be wrong . he < u > could < /u > have climbed up earlier .

that 's when he fell .

now you believe there were < u > two < /u > lanterns when defendant arrived . one in carl 's hand . the second lashed to the mast .

he 's looking down . and he 's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday . he 's proud of the man you are tonight . that 's what counts .

yes , he was .

your daddy . was quite a feller .

you 're wondering why i held it .

look , no way i 'm lettin ' you out there . in a half hour you could be in canada .

you think that < u > is < /u > the truth .

so every time you think about showing that jury strength . or honor or composure . or dignity .

the damage was considerable . but she 's insured . thanks , again .

she 's alright , nels , thanks for asking .

how < u > is < /u > your mother-in-law ?

i believe so .

so the defendant went out fishing for the night with < u > no < /u > spare battery , hmmn ?

yessir , there 'd been real heavy fog .

right . in the middle . of the floor .

he had no reason to .

not in those words .

i would n't say encouraged .

melton , on the double ! up a chain ! melton sir ! melton takes a few easy strides , gracefully catches a chain mid- stride , and smarts up , climbing easily and twice as fast as todd . church , sloan , and rubrick crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters . three quarters of the way up , melton comes even with todd , then passes him . mekum , watching , smirks . church is watching too , and he 's still not satisfied . his brow is knit , something 's bothering him . angle high above , among the girders stonefaced , melton is resting an a `` platform '' on the chain , sixty feet up , beneath the girders , swaying gently . his stony gaze is on the next chain where todd is arriving at a `` platform '' on an adjacent chain ... only three feet away . their eyes meet , todd and melton alone together sixty feet up , three feet apart . neither man blinks , neither man flinches , neither man reveals anything at all ... low angle , looking up church considers the men high above , then to mekum . church what about ... spirit ?

maybe we could run some tests . kind of a comparison , the old and the new ...

mmmmmm . weeell , you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying ...

as i said , in every way . physically and psychologically . more endurance , quicker responses , better hand-eye , improved technical training . where the first psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience , this bunch gives you 99.4 .

it 's from satchel mouth at table seven . this is from me to you , doll .

which of you dolls is daphne ?

are n't you a little too young for that , sonny ?

i do n't know - but i can feel it right here . that 's one good thing about ulcers - it 's like a burglar alarm going off inside you .

all right , girls - from the top again .

i beg your pardon .

i thought i made it clear i do n't want any drinking in this outfit .

hi , mary lou - rosella - okay , dolores , get a move on - how 's your back , olga ?

my suitcase - with all my resort clothes .

you 're welcome .

hey , she 's ticklish !

me and tiny , we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle .

what happened ?

like i was telling you - little bonaparte is getting soft . he does n't have it here any more . used to be like a rock . too bad . i think it 's time for him to retire .

yeah , but they 're not watching yachts . come on - you 're going to call osgood .

we 'll walk . and if we have to , we 'll starve .

you crazy or something ? the place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you 're making like diamond jim brady ! how are we going to get out of here ? how are we going to eat ?

no tricks , no mirrors , nothing up my sleeve . it 's on the level this time .

wait a minute - my bracelet . what happened to my bracelet ?

yeah - lets shove off .

i do n't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here .

i may throw up .

that 's when i was a saxophone player . now i 'm a millionaire .

telephone call ? who 's got time for that ?

get me room 414 .

but they 're from osgood . he wanted me to wear them tonight .

nag , nag , nag . look , we got a yacht , we got a bracelet , you got osgood , i 've got sugar - we 're really cooking .

so ? it 's going to break sugar 's heart when she finds out i 'm not a millionaire . that 's life . you ca n't make an omelette without breaking an egg .

get it while you 're young . and you better fix your lips . you want to look nice for osgood , do n't you ?

daphne got a proposal tonight .

jerry , listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it 's just not being done !

oh , i do n't expect it to last . i 'll tell him the truth when the time comes .

jerry - there 's another problem .

i 'll say there is !

osgood proposed to me . we 're planning a june wedding .

oh , no . i 'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy .

come on , you can do better than that . give him teeth - the whole personality .

he 's going to be ashore with you .

of course , you 're not . i 'm going .

just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and rudy vallee .

oh , he does !

and what are you trying to do to poor sugar ? putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent - nobody talks like that ! i 've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -

this happens to me all the time in public .

do n't get burned , daphne .

we can get a job with another band . a male band .

blow where ?

what happened ?

male and female - the moth and the flame - i ought to slug you !

what 's going on here ? daphne - daphne -

when i was a kid , i used to have a dream - i was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and boston cream pie and cherry tarts -

i 'm josephine . sax .

hello , everybody . i 'm the bass fiddle . just call me daphne .

and it 's so drafty . they must be catching colds all the time .

shave our legs , stupid .

we are going out of town . but we 're going to shave .

we got to get out of town . maybe we ought to grow beards .

the police ? we 'd never live to testify . not against spats colombo . wabash 1098 .

you going to call the police ?

we did n't see anything - - did we ?

knock it off , will you ?

it 's twelve bucks . we can get one of the overcoats out of hock .

josephine and geraldine ! come on !

now you 're talking ! we pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves josephine and geraldine -

but , joe - three weeks in florida ! we could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -

yeah , that 's what he means . good old nellie ! i ought to wring her neck !

you mean it 's a girls ' band ?

so i had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion ... right ?

it did ? boy , did it ever !

i thought you were n't talking to me .

i told you - it 's a sure thing .

shut up , will you ? i wonder how much sam the bookie will give up for our overcoats ?

but suppose he loses ?

you 're going to bet my money on a dog ?

first thing tomorrow we 're going to pay everybody a little something on account .

junior gave it to me . it must have at least thirty stones -

i always did .

did he get fresh ?

we do n't have to run .

now look , daphne - hands off - i saw him first .

come on , daphne .

i recognized him too - his picture was in vanity fair .

that 's from carrying around the bull fiddle .

i mean , your shoulders - and your arms -

you know , daphne - i had no idea you were such a big girl .

just a little trick i picked up in the elevator .

what do you think you 're doing ?

we 'll rent some at the bathhouse . how about you , josephine ?

a bunch of us girls are going for a swim . want to come along ?

here you are , sugar .

i 'm just going to get some ice .

and bring the cocktail shaker .

you better put on the lights . i ca n't see what i 'm doing .

i tell you - this is the only way to travel .

you all right ?

i know where to get some . do n't move .

look , sugar , if you feel you 're coming down with something , the best thing is a shot of whiskey .

i 'm not that sick .

interesting .

when i was a little girl , on cold nights like this , i used to crawl into bed with my sister . we 'd cuddle up under the covers , and pretend we were lost in a dark cave , and were trying to find out way out .

we wo n't tell anybody - not even josephine .

i do n't want her to know we 're in cahoots .

i wanted to thank you for covering for me . you 're a real pal .

see you around , girls .

we 'll take a rain check .

oh - here and there - and around .

wait a minute , joe . lets talk this over . why could n't we do it ? last year , when we played in that gypsy tearoom , we wore gold earrings . and you remember when you booked us with that hawaiian band ? grass skirts !

but you do n't understand ! i 'm a man !

i called mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it 's white lace .

another bridesmaid ?

this is my friend josephine - she 's going to be a bridesmaid .

sorry .

daphne ...

you know something , mr. fielding ? you 're dynamite !

who ?

well , i 'll be - ! he does have a bicycle .

goodbye ?

she does n't approve of girls who smoke .

why ?

bull fiddle .

oh , of course . which of these instruments do you play ?

you do n't say .

i am cinderella the second .

just a moment , miss - may i ?

the new caledonia . that 's the name of it . the old caledonia went down during a wild party off cape hatteras . but tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us .

this is her roommate . daphne ca n't talk right now . is it anything urgent ?

i 'm not doing anything . i just thought i 'd go home and have some cold pizza -

you 're making it up pretty good so far .

you got it . it 's six dollars a man . be on the campus in urbana at eight o'clock -

we 'll take it !

no , we could n't !

the instruments are right , but you are not . i want to speak to mr. morris .

nellie , get me long distance . what is it ?

we got time off for good behavior .

do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -

smart move . oh , by the way - did you get my flowers ? you know , those orchids from my greenhouse - the fog finally lifted over long island , and they flew them down this morning .

oh - that kind of a merger . is she young ? pretty ?

that 's wonderful . poor josephine .

did you have a nice time ?

oh , no . i 'm off that stuff - for good .

let 's make it an even million .

eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars .

good night .

oh , you know - junior league - charity bazaars - i used to sell kisses for the milk fund .

i 'm not quite sure . try it again .

it 's like smoking without inhaling .

you 're not giving yourself a chance . do n't fight it . relax .

look , it 's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it 's no use . i think the light switch is over there - - and that 's the radio . it 's like taking somebody to a concert when he 's tone deaf .

i 'm afraid not . terribly sorry .

anything this time ?

maybe if you saw a good doctor ...

is that anything ?

ever since then - numb - no feelings . like my heart was shot full of novocaine .

yes . eight hours later they brought her up by mule - i gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - type o - it was too late .

what happened ?

have i ? i 'm trying all the time .

they just sort of leave me cold .

what thing ?

oh , it 's not that . it 's just that i 'm - harmless .

oh , it 's perfectly safe . we 're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the coast guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around .

you know , i 've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean .

yea , of course . now where could they have put it ? on thursdays , i 'm sort of lost around here .

trophies . you know - skeet-shooing , dog-breeding , water polo ...

bon voyage .

champagne ?

caught him off cape hatteras .

what a beautiful fish .

my dad is more interested in railroads . baltimore and ohio . which is the port and which is the starboard ?

do you mind riding backwards ? it may take a little longer -

it 's not how long you wait - it 's who you 're waiting for .

because he said he 's coming to hear us play - maybe .

anyway , you 're going to meet him tonight .

well , he 's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he 's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers .

guess !

it 's on the account of the shells . that 's my hobby .

why ?

i 'd like to - but it may be rather difficult .

tonight ?

- inauguration balls -

so do i. as a matter of fact , i spent three years at the sheboygan conservatory of music .

yeah . real hot .

syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz ?

you 're society girls ?

i 'll bet just while we were talking , you made like a hundred thousand dollars .

up , up , up .

and who mixes the cocktails - your wife ?

you have a yacht ?

they run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it 's time for cocktails .

your view of what ?

thank you .

i 'll bet there is n't one of them under seventy-five .

bienstock . he snores to beat the band . we cut cards to see who sleeps over him , and i always lose . would n't you know ?

why not ?

they get those weak eyes from reading - you know , all those long columns of tiny figures in the wall street journal .

well , now that you 've mentioned it -

men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless . have n't you ever noticed ?

about what ?

you are ?

you know i 'm going to be twenty-five in june ?

brains are n't everything .

yeah .

you know - i play tenor sax .

you see , i have this thing about saxophone players .

i 'll say .

have you ever been with a male band ?

no , just dumb . if i had any brains , i would n't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls ' band .

if bienstock catches you again - what 's the matter with you , anyway ?

if they catch me once more , they 'll boot me out of the band . you the replacement for the bass and the sax ?

tell what ?

where are they holding the wake ? i 'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers .

that 's because i 've been on the wagon .

because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them .

big joke !

well , spats colombo - if i were saw one .

from who ? toothpick charlie , maybe ?

me ? i 'm just a customer here .

a little country club we run for retired bootleggers . i 'm gon na put your name up for membership .

go where ?

goodbye , charlie .

i already told you .

and who runs it ?

all right , charlie - this the joint ?

so now i got all those coffins on my hands - and i hate to see them go to waste .

you do n't owe me no nothing .

sure , disappear . weve been walking away our whole lives .

hey .

are you sure youre okay ?

god , kat ! please . dont be nice to me . i can take anything right now but you being nice to me .

but i do . i will . youre my sister .

when i freaked out at the pub ? that was nothing , just nerves . dont worry about it .

do you want to come in for a minute ? we could talk about --

i dont think i can go through with this .

why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole ?

christ , amy .

but im not taking your name , buster . im a feminist ! i need icey ! mr. husband-man , get me more icey !

perfect . all ginny .

exactly ! todays my day . tomorrow will be my day . and the day after that ? my day .

theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you ?

if ed ever found out ... .

still --

sorry to interrupt . your dad sent me .

its not me . i swear . its her . shes magic .

does kat know ?

whatever you do , dont mention italy . or politics . or baby buggies . or edith piaf .

youd better get going . my parents will be round to cart you off to the country .

she did ?

theres a reason i always tell that tony pee-pants story , you know .

she blames tony pee-pants pinterello for everything . the fall of the british empire , the cold war , the internet .

oh , dont be that way .

im sure general eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces . oh , and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the fletcher-wootens .

yeah .

you heading to the train station ?

whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding , honestly ?

and you do now ?

and kat was fully clothed .

relax . take a breath and just say it . its no big deal . i promise .

bollocks , im sorry . i had no idea this would be so difficult .

not for a dog .

so , whats your point ?

that was a long time ago .

its called character . god , youre predictable .

hey , yourself . i see youve met my ex .

hello , katmandu .

thank you .

nice speech . i thought it was touching ... and funny .

hi .

youre judging me ? ! oh , thats a good one . youre lying to me , youre lying to your family , and youre lying to yourself . but youre going to stand there and point a finger at me ? the man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend ?

spontaneously combust ?

what would you do if you were n't an escort ?

i just hate seeing you so stuck .

but nothing did .

we kissed . made out a little . then you passed out .

ive got this bad taste in my mouth . what is it ? i think its the words : morally repugnant .

its hard to explain .

so ... what was i ... oh , yeah . do you honestly think that i want to be single and miserable ? that i want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart .

and you thought id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries ?

a weekend ?

why ?

youre too good for him .

well , he looks miserable . what were you talking about ?

oh , yeah . so we split it . you know , as in share . people do that .

the knicks game ? we both wanted the last hot dog ?

mmm .

im so sorry .

you knew ?

oh , no . he told you .

whats he do anyway ?

i wasnt saving you from him . i was saving you from yourself .

sure . youve got to play them against each other . otherwise they think youre easy .

i heard you were back in town , kitty cat . youre here for the highland flings , i bet .

yeah .

ahoy !

meet nick .

whewwww ! you sure keep my mind jumping , boy !

and so you did your job , right ?

i been like that myself , when i thought nobody was gon na believe me ... you wan na hear another story ? !

... so me and sounder , ran right by the men that was the prisoners , and crawled under the fence ! that 's when i cut my hand on the glass . it hurt like mad ! but i kept runnin ' , and then i did n't feel no more hurtin ' till i stopped runnin ' ! why was that , miss johnson ?

what about sounder ?

why do n't you sit and i 'll read you something he said .

that 's where we come from first ?

did your mother know you were going to see your father ?

me and sounder went to this prison camp to see my daddy and the police guard runs us away and i fell on some glass .

it 's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this ?

my name is camille -- camille johnson and i 'm the supervisor of this school . what 's your name ?

here , you put your hand under the water and i 'll pump for you .

i do n't know , he 's in a prison camp .

you do n't live around here , do you ?

can you swim ?

go on ...

you know that the class is going to challenge your story , do n't you , clarence ?

: he , josie and earl , running and playing in the field .

: the night in the woods with his father and sounder . the shouting and laughter after the baseball game --

: -- the strange endings of nature they have seen , may give the world new points of view and make their loving , living , and doing precious to all human ...

you getting the point , mrs. boatwright .

charlie , you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is ! you hear that , you and this whole damn court house ; what you are doing is wrong !

i did look , charlie , but i --

i see you found what you was lookin ' for .

i ca n't do it , rita -- that 's the policy here on colored prisoners , and i ai n't about to change it , not even for a friend like you .

but , daddy , you need me here to help you in the field -- daddy , your leg is hurt -- you ca n't work like you used to . who 's gon na help you ! ? who 's gon na do the work , daddy ? !

dear david , if you are coming to school here , be sure to bring some warm clothes . the school term will begin september 8th , but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month . i do hope everything is fine and you will be here . give my `` hello '' to your family . yours truly , miss camille johnson ...

you feel alright today , daddy ?

they gone to the field ...

mornin ' , daddy ...

goodnight , daddy ...

you bet we is !

what 's wrong with your leg , daddy ?

why , daddy ; you wo n't be here ?

i think so ...

he 'll show up one day .

we did n't find sounder yet .

mama is outside with josie mae and earl .

`` you lose some of the time , what you always go afta , but you lose all the time what you do n't go afta ! ''

we goin ' huntin ' again tomorrow ?

you had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow .

david lee ...

he beat you , too , daddy , and you had a big ol ' shootin ' rifle .

if anybody 's to blame , it 's me -- i oughta nailed him when i took that shot .

it 's cold , daddy !

why do n't you try and git you a new dog ?

he will ... come on , git down and act like a possum .

then why do n't he holler like he usta ?

so when i left , she gave me these books .

some books miss johnson gave me .

did you find your father ?

yes , mam ...

can i go day after tomorrow ?

i can do it , mama -- you know that . in the bible stories you read to us , everybody 's always goin ' on a long journey . jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he do n't even know where he lives , but he finds him . everybody finds what they supposed to find .

so did i. i figured when the time got right , we could all take a day or two and walk up there , but it 's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone .

he 'll be all right , mama . i 'll make him all right .

i think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot . i do n't think he 's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself .

who is they ?

nobody yet -- it 's all tied up .

who 's winning , mama ?

tuck that shirt in , david lee .

ready to go , mama !

where did it come from , mama ?

you know where my father is , do n't you , miss boatwright ?

i 'll find out where your daddy is for you .

would you like to have a cool drink , david ?

it 's about the three musketeers .

what did the lord tell you , ike ?

at the way you ask funny questions , josie mae !

might be ...

maybe soon --

i did n't say nothin ' 'bout credit , mr. howard .

i hope it ai n't a lot , 'cause i ca n't give you no more credit till the croppin ' season gits back , that is if na --

rebecca , you jest the one i wanta see .

do n't tell me nothin ' 'bout what we owe ol ' man howard ! i 'll do the owing , and let him worry 'bout the collecting ! come on , david lee !

to the commissary to get this boy some clothes ! i 'm gon ' get everybody somethin ' !

it 's lunchtime , and i wan na have a talk with you , nathan lee . come on , children ...

i just got out here !

if there ever was a devil in this county , ike , you is it !

the boy done went into my walnuts ! i skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that 's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what i pick !

it 's a shame , reverend . it 's a damn shame .

that 's the way they do things here in landsdown . i just follow orders .

i do n't understand that , sheriff young .

now go , your friends are in danger ... the uso show is a mile east of here , just over that ridge . the clitoris has spoken .

that 's it ! i have had enough ! ! ! !

listen guy , you 're embarassing me in front of my friends ! you know how i get mad when i get embarassed .

help you ? you 've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you ? ! you 're always making me feel like a piece of shit .

relax bitch ! you 're better seen , not hear okay ?

i do respect your mind ! it turns me on ! it makes me wan na fuck the shit out of you ! do n't you see ?

well i just want you to be impressed with what i < u > do < /u > . i want you to respect my mind .

i mean cute dumb . now bend over !

do n't call me dumb !

i know .

do you always think about sex ? i 'm talking about some very important stuff here !

it has come to be ... the four horsemen are drawing nigh ! the time of the prophecy is upon us !

hey , come here , guy .

sometimes i just think you do n't have any respect for me .

hey , relax guy . it 's just a cruel joke . rich , chocolatey snacky smores are only available up on earth . he 'll never get 'em , see ?

hey relax , guy . let 's see what the kid wants .

saddam , would you let me do my job please !

stan , i never cared for gregory .

god damn it , why does she keep saying that ?

nothing , stan . you would n't understand .

nazis ! !

hi wendy .

yeah !

did n't you think it was funny , wendy ?

and ze rope ?

oh warren ... oh warren ... take me , god take me ...

getting drunk is no solution .

i 'll tell you what i 'm going to do .

very professional of you .

i 'm sure i will .

koros , as in ... koros ? dimitri koros ?

anna koros . she sensually extends her hand , warren shakes it -

my ... wings ...

well you did the right thing mac .

and what are they doing now , mac ?

where the hell did you come from ?

it 's a little late for you to be up .

what did you say to me ?

ai n't it the truth . must be good to be rich .

why should she , it 's her fault . all guests are told not to eat in zero gravity , but she just wanted to have fun i guess , did n't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery .

look you said it does n't matter to you anyway ! why do you want to kill more innocent people ! why !

i do n't know what you 're talking about !

well , preferably in tens and twenties ...

we have the codes here . how do you want to receive them ?

it 's still not going to work ! they 'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel !

then we 've got to get to the lifepods !

ok , i will . the bad news is the ship is history . life support will last another 36 hours , maybe .

the bridge is fine , taylor , how are things down there ?

well , maybe i 'll surprise you .

i think i can handle it .

i do n't know . everything 's up in the air at this point , no pun intended .

well , everything 's running smoother than a baby 's ass .

trust me . even checked 'em with my own eyes .

yes i 'm sure i hit the right commands .

there must be some mistake . you sure you hit the right commands ?

let 's get something straight , chappy !

do n't worry about me , i 'm changing coordinates now . i 've come to far to be tripped up by some dudley do-right ... motherfuckers !

the others decided to get cute with me , so i 'm teaching them a lesson !

well that 's your call . does n't make a damn bit of difference to me . just as long as i get my cut .

i do n't know . i really have n't made up my mind yet . we 'll see how nicely they behave .

barnes ?

well , more power to you . me , i start to bug out after too much time out here .

try not to think about it .

that 's right . will you marry me ?

i never thought this would happen . no premonitions , nothing .

and so far .

sooner than later .

hopefully sooner than later .

thanks for everything , taylor . will i see you again ?

i 'm staying with the ship . i 'll be all right . now hurry .

barnes ?

but you ca n't be sure ! it 's suicide . you have to come with us !

but how are you going to escape ?

the room is filled with poison gas . the hydraulic system must have blown .

oh my god . what happened ?

dawn ! dawn !

do n't worry about what will happen , just concentrate on what is happening . you 'll live longer .

sure .

one of barnes ' duds , luckily for us . take this out of the equation right now ...

do n't worry about me . where are we going ?

so we did .

i do n't know what we 're facing .

look i know what i 'm doing . i have experience and training in space walking .

i ca n't let you do that .

he certainly is polite .

we could send mac . if he can retrieve one suit , we could go back for the other .

and suppose you could n't hold out ?

i do n't know the condition of the compartments . depending on damage , debris ... could be a fatal mistake .

damn it . if only we could get to those suits ... dawn then thinks of something -

great .

supposing we could get out of this room ? is there anything we could do to reach the bridge ?

just considering our options ... sir .

probably come through the wall i suppose .

fat chance of that . even if we had c4 and a laser torch these doors would n't budge . that son of a bitch ... that stupid son of a bitch .

well maybe there 's a way out of here .

what are we going to do ?

really ?

well , plus the money ai n't that bad . dawn so , tell me , do you think everyone gets their million dollars ' worth on this trip of a lifetime ?

so you were looking for a new challenge .

oh right , right you 're on that research grant .

no , just enjoying the view .

thank you .

where 's taylor ?

how is it going to be different from this ? go see some boring footprint under glass ?

we should have gone to nassau . at least we could go swimming , lie on the beach .

who are you calling a pig , rummy ?

look . we 're talking about life and death here . i do n't know why we 're even having this conversation .

is it safe for human transport ?

i know but we 're in a bind .

yeah but the ship 's mainframe does n't . i need you to tell it something .

i need you to actually do something for me . i need to access your cpu , directly .

right , i understand that ...

certainly . i have a full working knowledge of the ships operations .

my father used to say to me `` never ... '' no , hmmm . `` always ... '' no , no ... ah ! love and hate are blood relations .

find your bowler ?

i 'm from akron .

orange who ? not from 'round here , are ya ?

can i get you something for the road ?

you a mini-golfer ?

you tried to make it look like junior trashed his place . junior 's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in .

i should 've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one .

it belonged to my dad .

nothing going on here , everybody stand back . let him through , ladies . ladies , please . as they start to move through the female throng , a little girl pops out in front of them , holding her ball .

how do you turn this thing off ?

sure , sid .

you got an 8-track tape player on purpose , just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin ' opera .

when you get a chance .

oh , a professional man . what 'll you have ?

yeah , and make it extra muddy , i did n't sleep a zee last night . sheila fills a cup . buzz lifts it to his mouth , his hands trembling .

i 'm sure you have buzz .

miles , i 've always been on the square with you .

we 've been partners a long time now , have n't we buzz ?

listen , if straight does n't work out , you come work for me . just make sure nobody 's following you . buzz 's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset , his halo bouncing in the breeze .

thanks , kid . where are you goin ' now ?

so , eh , you never saw me . right ?

i told you to get lost . you forced yourself into this mess , so the mess accommodated you . buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo .

no ...

i 'm getting to like it here .

theo , i want you to get out of this town .

fuck you and fuck bowling .

do n't say that about my mom !

i 'm your blood .

i do what i got ta do to survive .

theo .

she thinks someone 's trying to kill you .

she 's my mom .

who gave it to you ?

it 's mine .

thanks .

my mom was there . she told me about it . the 'fazeli split . '

remember the finals in akron in '59 ? you had a seven-ten split in the final frame .

i need a sponsor to get my sanction card back . where i come from , you 're the king .

i can appeal in five . i was hoping you could help me mr. fazeli .

i got suspended when i was young , too . i was pretty cocky in my day .

do n't worry about the congress , they 're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies .

well , mr. fazeli , the bowling congress says i 'm a thorn in their side .

my poor baby !

son ?

bowlers do n't go around killing other bowlers . he 's only a fan , millie . i 'll give him some tips and an autograph and he 's outta here .

he 's not the guy , millie . just whip the whips .

he 's the guy buzz .

i found dad .

do n't tell me , john .

you played bouncy-bouncy with sheila , so i 'm gon na play blue-face with you .

what did you do to buzz ?

you should n't touch her .

who 's there !

knock-knock .

do you have to get your hooks into every guy i 'm interested in ?

it 's not so bad . when i 'm alone , it feels like someone else . sheila grabs the bottle from junior , opens it and pours some on her shish kebab . she leans over and whispers furiously to her father .

i have someone for you to play with junior .

it 's not an `` alley '' . i hate when people call it a `` bowling alley '' , it 's so common ! i prefer `` bowling center '' .

he killed your stoolie embezzler father , and he 's gon na kill you next ! sid and breeze push him towards the van as the crowd 's murmur increases . kastle turns and yells over his shoulder .

you need a sponsor ; i have influence . i could sponsor you .

what if he wants to get out ?

if it springs a leak , it 'll be because buzz is making waves .

nice set-up .

you still got the touch junior .

fantastic ! what talent .

leave him alone !

you 're using theo for your own deviant purposes !

that 's why mom ran away , because you had to control everything !

i bet you did n't know that you and junior have something in common , theo : junior ca n't bowl anymore either . is n't that right junior ? kastle slams the ketchup bottle down on junior 's right hand . the table settings jump from the shock . junior sits impassively , his face a blank .

line up where you want it .

that 's right , sugar , find the grip that 's right for you . then grasp firmly . the camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green .

where can i find him ?

he 's no father to you .

he 's my father , millie .

get that outta your mouth !

i 'm sick of you people . why do n't you leave him be ?

you bet . for five bucks , i 'll even throw in the tongue .

i 'm not dumping you , i 'm suspending you .

what makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum ? huh ?

i did n't come this far to bury a guy that 's not my dad . he owes me .

say something , theo . give me something . a doll 's legs catch fire . theo stares into sheila 's eyes .

at least i 'll die smiling .

i killed him once , i 'll just have to kill him again .

why did you come back ?

i did n't stop to take his pulse .

did you - kill him ?

i ca n't tell you , theo .

you know how people with broken bones know when there 's a storm coming ?

what are you going to do about your brother ?

i could let them go for ten .

it 's been awhile . she did n't want me looking for my dad .

oh really ? nothing ? my dad does n't do anything unless there 's something in it for him .

what 's plan b ?

i used to be kind of wild . they used to call me the bad boy of bowling .

so , what about you ?

nobody in this town really understands junior . when i went to family sessions for him i realized he was the sanest one in the family . actually , he 's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants .

can i ask you something personal ?

mind if i cut in ?

everything has it 's drawbacks .

your dad 's one of the only nice people in this fucking town . my dad is slime . kastle walks over . theo stands up and shakes kastle 's proffered hand .

mine , and they never tip .

ow ! ooh ! no , please ! doc said i 'd be back on the planks in a week ! show him breeze ! breeze pulls a copy of `` new york bowler '' from his pocket . the headline reads `` rub out ! : bowling legend kacked by dwarfscam kingpin '' with a photo of buzz fazeli .

the body was identified along proper bowling congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality .

you guys got something going on downstairs ?

you drag that coconut around for your health , or do you know how to use it ?

i 'm not here to bowl .

i ca n't ...

now !

norman , do n't do it !

do it , norman , it 's the only choice we have . this thing is gon na crush us .

do n't pull it , norman . it 'll start a < u > fire < /u > we ca n't stop . norman ?

it 's either that or we grow gills .

what was that ?

why ca n't i -- ? what the hell is going on here ?

sure . each time it started fires inside the habitat .

what if it attacks ?

i 'm not sure . i 've never seen anything like it .

yeah . i heard you .

what are you -- his mother ? get norman , i want everyone ready to go . edmunds , the subs ?

any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up ?

there 's heat coming the door .

basic english ? there 's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet .

what the hell ? it shut us down .

bullshit . what 's out there is n't alien . it 's an animal .

yes , i do . whatever 's out there , i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier .

i do n't want you talking to jerry .

edmunds ?

i think we should be careful . consider his emotional response .

he translated it wrong . `` my name is jerry '' ? it 's like `` see spot run . ''

so you knew this when you wrote your report ?

when was this ?

you do n't want to know .

i 'm not paranoid . i know beth . she can be drastic .

no `` buts '' . if he wants to be left , we 'll leave him . hello ? yes , the subs -- i want a report ... hello ... yes , a report . gim me ... shit .

or maybe , it ca n't < u > be < /u > killed .

i do n't know . but it 's something alien .

it 's a corrosive gas . on earth , it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly , iron rust on an oldsmobile . at a pressure this low , oxygen becomes toxic . breathe it down here , and it 'll do to your dick what it does to the oldsmobile .

ulf report ? nobody 's mentioned that in years . you mean someone actually read it ?

the one you recommended . in the ulf report you wrote for the bush administration .

it 's impossible .

maybe older --

hold on --

what is it ? a military spacecraft ? like a shuttle or satellite ?

then why am i here ?

a thousand feet .

from what ? what 's with all the security ?

good . security 's been our biggest worry . now that you 're here we can shut this thing down tight .

press ? no , i have n't .

you talk to any reporters ? any press ?

do n't thank me , dr. johnson . you were n't my choice . the pentagon made me take you .

sir ! sir , the door -- it 's opening .

nothing , sir .

i 'm getting no sub reading , sir .

what caused it ?

we do n't have anything else to try , sir .

i 'm in charge .

i have to tell you . it 's strange .

we 're all very proud of you , harry , but what the hell is it ?

who is that ? where 's that coming from ?

ladies and gentlemen ...

it could . but the odds of it being any use to us are against it .

or it could contain some great benefit to us , some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind .

so ? what 's the problem ?

ted seems to have some ideas .

so how do we get it open ?

a break for what ?

to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere .

what ?

so do we . and it seems to have picked up something on it 's travels .

we know how this craft got here . where it 's been .

ted ? captain ?

chipped ? the door ? how can it be chipped ?

in the dome hanger . all our tapes are transferred to the sub . it 's on a 12 hour timer . if someone does n't reset the `` delay '' button , the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes .

what sub ?

give him a chance . he 's speaking our language , not the other way around .

what 's inside the sphere .

ted , shut up . are you packed ? ready to go ? i want everyone packed . now !

did you hear me , sir , because --

maybe we did n't want to come back .

what would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back ?

time travel . i always thought it was one of those myths ... like santa 's reindeer .

look at this .

what are you going to do -- shoot her ?

get away --

beth --

get away from me !

what is that ? what are you doing ?

beth ?

stop what ? do n't blame me . it 's not me .

beth !

it 's your choice . because it 's not safe for you to be awake . to be walking around . to be thinking about things .

it 's either this ... or i kill you .

i promise --

yes .

that 's when you went in the sphere .

yes , someone did . but it was n't me , norman . it was you . you manifested the snakes .

someone did .

no , he ca n't .

why did you go in the sphere , beth ?

what 's the phrase -- `` keeping up with the joneses '' ?

you tell me .

what are they doing down here ? in the bathroom ? suddenly appearing .

am i afraid of them ? not during the day . sea snakes are diurnal . when the sun 's out , they do n't bite . fortunately for you , i had on my watch . this is quite good .

oh yes , my watch . i almost forgot .

your watch .

ulcers .

it 's for motion sickness .

looks like some sort of code .

he acquired some sort of power . a power to manifest things .

after the attack , a navy guy woke me up -- i do n't know -- i thought he was an illusion . but i checked the tape , and jerry said he manifested him .

1-800-deepsea delivery . i hear they 're good .

we must 've had it delivered then .

it 's a pretty common place to look for food when you do n't think you have any .

fixing it ? but i fixed -- where 'd you get all that ?

what 's harry doing with your suit in there ?

i think so , beth . yes .

yeah , well , i get that way when i 'm facing death and someone deserts me .

... what do you mean ? i 'm in the ship .

what 's the matter ?

you should know how it works . just in case .

i have to reset the sub .

in edmunds ' things .

`` although advised of risks , all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft . signed , barnes , usn . ''

nobody said ... norman ... what ? why are you looking at me like that ?

beth .

they are or they are n't . which is it ?

i mean , i 'm not ... i was n't absolutely sure if ... they --

beth --

and you did n't tell anyone ?

what do you mean -- not normal ?

me ? well , i was wrapped in seaweed . it itched for a while , but i survived . beth , do you find it ... curious that we 're seeing all this life down here . nothing , and then these enormous flocks of squid . then jellyfish ?

the library .

where 'd this come from ?

get this thing off me .

no . go ahead . really . ladies first .

to the spacecraft . to investigate .

it 's bullshit . the report 's a joke .

that ulf report everybody 's patting me on the back about ?

he does n't wait for an answer .

well , think . because there 's footprints here that are n't mine .

no . i do n't think so .

no i 'm not . i 'm not star --

like what ? i 'm not --

another attack ?

just in time for what ?

what ?

harry ? that 's bullshit . we stood right there --

when he woke up , he said we were out of food . he told me to get some from the ship .

cannibalism , to be extreme . and now we 're talking about a new life form . their values and ethics may be incomprehensible .

what are you looking for ?

it 's an american spacecraft .

for whoever 's in that thing .

for who ? the fish ?

harry thinks it 's some sort of discharge from our own system , but i 've seen it discharge before -- and it did n't look anything like this .

minutes ago . harry 's trying to decode it in his room now .

when did it come across ?

you mean forget ?

it 's not fast enough , norman . there 's a helluva lot of explosive down there .

less than a minute , we 're never gon na make it .

wait !

get her out of the seat , i need room to sit . harry ?

you got her ?

just pull her -- down like inside -- harry , work with me here !

c'mon , norman !

i heard ! i heard !

hurry , norman . four minutes .

hold on .

i do n't think so .

that 's right .

but why would she -- ?

beth left ?

... you there ? norman ?

did i ?

there 's some sort of pattern here . it 'll take a minute .

what are they ?

page 87 of what , harry ?

you were all supposed to leave . you were n't supposed to stay down here .

what noise ?

what is that ? that noise ?

curious , is n't it ? what 's inside ? before i die , i 'd sure like to open it and see .

it 's what 's in that sphere , is n't it , harry ? whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it 's going to kill you .

look -- we 're under a lot of pressure , we 're tired , you 're not thinking straight .

meaning we 're never gon na get to the surface alive ... to tell anyone .

meaning we 're never gon na get the chance to tell anyone .

a sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible .

do n't be so optomistic , harry .

our present .

look , would you --

you sound defensive .

i 'm not being defensive .

do n't be defensive .

... i asked myself , why would the sphere be using a code ? if you 're trying to communicate , why use a code ?

if it is a message , it 's probably a substitution code . i 'll work on it .

it 's not a discharge . right , edmunds ? you said before , right ? so it 's got ta be a message .

looks like a design , some writing , maybe . maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message .

not where . when . 400 years ago . from our future .

meaning ?

it 's been obvious from the start , has n't it , captain ? that 's why all the secrecy , why no one was told about it ?

do you ?

but it 's impossible .

a spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it ? someone went to a lot of trouble . try again .

you 're not afraid of the water , are you , norman ?

just one of norman 's many secrets .

beth and harry ?

how are the others ?

you mean they have n't told you yet ?

captain barnes wants to see you right away , sir .

physicists , mathematicians , geologists , you name it .

know what ?

oh , so you 're that dr. johnson .

you think jerry has something to do with what killed edmunds ? with what 's out there ?

frankly , ted , i 'd be much happier if jerry was just a cold , emotionless intellect .

you want to put him on your couch , norman . grill him about his childhood ?

inside the sphere . look , that 's the vertical torso , three legs , two arms . there 's no head , so i 'm guessing the creature 's head is located within the torso itself , you know ?

please , ted .

you mean a picture ?

he was n't feeling well .

i do n't know .

how are you getting to the airport ? you need money for the bus ?

keep watching the news . are you watching the news ?

well , i ca n't imagine five years of unemployment --

in the closet . i do n't understand , norman -- why would they call you ?

there is a greater risk in staying here , you know . if you do n't find the princess , then the whole trip was for nothing ... was n't it ?

it 's not good ... unless i could find the crystal . then it could be very good .

i 'll get the information .

check your data banks for all the information you have on imperial procedures . both of you will have to learn ...

not bad .

this is n't a game , you know .

anything i want ! now that 's interesting .

i think there are some things we should talk about .

you might get your stuff together . we 'll be coming up on organa major soon .

the kiber crystal .

i 'm not going alone !

what about the princess ?

he ca n't find organa major .

when we get artoo 's message to them , you think they 'll try to rescue the princess ?

luke , i 'm coming along to do what i can , but i 'm tired and i 'm depending on you to get us through .

what do you mean ?

but you must ! i ca n't do it alone . i 'm not at all like my father . i 'd never make it .

i ... i 'm not a bendu officer . i 'm not even a startrooper .

but you are ... i know your 'diary of the clone wars ' by heart . my father ...

i am the son of annikin starkiller .

just be warned , that things are n't always as they seem ... especially the starforce recruiting posters .

at least you 're doing something ... i 'd give anything to be in your position .

forget it , son .

what 's that ?

blue five , does that glare bother you ?

i 'd like to get paid before that eventually . i do n't plan to stick around for the fireworks .

we must hurry to the base . we have little time before the death star arrives .

did it occur to you they might find us ?

when artoo has been safely delivered to my forces , you get your reward . you have my guarantee .

yes , your highness . i 'll let you open it then . it wo n't be too long before they figure out what happened to us . this has turned into a brilliant escape !

no , he smells something ... but we have n't time to worry about it now .

i think she 's going to be all right .

this is n't going to work .

do n't you believe it .

maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us . they probably do n't think anyone would dare try .

you do n't believe in the force ?

you got yourself a ship . we can leave as soon as you 're ready .

organa major is a rebel system . there will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there ... it could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them ... ten thousand .

the ... ah door 's jammed . give us a few minutes to get it fixed .

no ! ...

enough ! i already know about the data you 've intercepted , but its ' too late . whatever information you 've gathered will be destroyed ... you will come to know such suffering as only the master of the bogan force can provide ...

your father 's dead . do n't ever forget who 's taking care of you , giving you food , giving you shelter , and giving you the allowance in the first place . if you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here , you wo n't last very long . i do n't want another word . finish your dinner , then finish cleaning those 'droids . '

i will , but i 'll have enough time to transmit my application first .

for the moment . we 're in the main hangar . artoo is trying to plug into the system now .

are you safe ?

i know , sir , but it 's the principle of the thing .

well , ask him . tell him we need five thousand .

i think we 're going to need them . blast it !

no , you 're not . what kind of talk is that ...

i ca n't make it . you go on , master luke . it does n't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account . i 'm done for .

tell me where you 've been . i am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars . my father was a jedi ! were you in many battles ?

that 's how we came to be in your service , if you take my meaning ...

indeed , sir , sometimes i 'm amazed we 're in as good shape as we are , what with the rebellion and all ...

there 's a lot of carbon scoring here . it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action ...

not unless you could get me into the military academy at anchorhead .

yes , sir !

jeez , we musta killed a million already ... !

no way . big k taught me i ai n't executive material .

lieutenant 's bought the farm . where 's the sarge ... ?

bye ! write me ! i 'm gon na kill you guys !

something ... i 've got ... you do n't .

i 'm eighteen . it 's my decision , i think i 'd make a pretty good pilot . i 've good great reflexes . you need that for maneuvering , you know .

i 've been thinking about applying for federal service , too . fleet , maybe .

statistically speaking you should 've accidentally guessed right by know .

zander , what are you doing ?

is it true ?

it was n't luck . rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you ...

i do .

i do n't know , zander .

how do you feel about him now ?

where are you going ?

you 're upset , that 's alright .

excuse me ... !

no , funny there 's almost no wounded at all .

i 'm telling you , you will ! you 're not going back . you 're going to go on vacation !

have you lost you lost your mind ? i 'd rather take ten lashes in public square than see you ruin your life .

aaaaaaaaaaa !

i do n't understand it , lieutenant . it 's not getting anything from 4th brigade ... not even their transponder .

i always wanted to go to zegema beach .

bill ... pick up ... it 's johnny ! you little rat . you have n't called , you have n't written . it 's been so lonely here without you ...

landing zone is extremely hostile . come down on this transmission !

shut up , sir ! we need pick up now !

rico , tell'em to glass this goddam planet . i 've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time ...

aaaaaaaaaaaa !

yes , sir !

yes , sir .

of course you do n't . i doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue ' if it bit you in the ass .

you . tell me the moral difference , if any , between the citizen and the civilian ?

then v'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices .

kirk unit ! disclose the information !

to join with him .

v'ger travels to the third planet to find the creator .

is v'ger the captain of the alien vessel ?

v'ger is that which programmed me .

as i stated , v'ger calls to the creator .

you said v'ger 's purpose was to find and join with the creator .

within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit . if i can help you revive these patterns ; you could understand our functions better .

more data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage .

enterprise would be unable to function < u > without < /u > carbon units .

what is enterprise 's proper evolvement ?

carbon units have clearly retarded enterprise 's proper evolvement .

tractor beam strength lessening , captain .

very well , mr. chekov , see to it . viewer off .

mr. decker ... i will contact you every five minutes . otherwise ... inform mr. scott immediately .

no !

forcefields , full remaining strength ... ! total reserve !

you asked my opinion , sir .

captain , we 've seen what their weapons can do . should n't we take every possible precaution -- ?

no ... ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile , mr. decker . cloud composition , mr. spock ?

recommend defensive posture , captain : screens and shields .

if our executive officer has no objections ... ?

granted .

stop competing with me , decker !

program set for standard warp entry , captain ...

jim ... he < u > wants < /u > it .

we could have cut it off at the main computer ...

that you left ? or that you did n't say 'goodbye ' ?

unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us , captain ! directly ahead ... !

i now the captain meant no person- al insult .

viewer , standard ahead .

thirty seconds to cloud boundary ...

my oath of celibacy is on record captain . may i assume my duties ?

and in you , too , lieutenant .

aye , sir .

hold station .

we 're losing the pattern ... !

there 's no way to know . v'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity . all of us here may be reduced into patterns ...

the point ...

yes , captain , a child : evolving into adulthood -- learning , searching -- instinctively needing .

child ... ! ?

what answers ?

what should you have known ?

ilia 's memory , her feelings of loyalty , friendship , obedience ... might all be there .

... they may have followed it < u > too < /u > precisely .

they had a pattern to follow ...

that vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the earth 's sun .

the 'puzzlement ' i sensed was fleeting ... minor ... ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance , captain .

any reply from them ?

it appears that our message has been understood , captain .

i know this has been painful , spock . for me too . thank you .

let it drop , bones . you are my science officer -- i 'll expect an < u > immediate < /u > report on anything further you learn or < u > sense < /u > from here on .

... is my only hope of accomplishing what the masters could not .

i still contain fragments of my human half .

i want him here . sit down !

captain decker requested i complete final science briefing here before ...

starfleet signals , sir , growing in strength ... they -- have intruder on their monitors -- it 's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate ...

i 'm sorry walt -- it 's gone beyond that .

... she works with < u > animals < /u > , she ...

i 'm only trying to ...

and you know what ... ?

i know , i know .

because he understood . that was her life 's blood on the stage .

listen to me : elanora < u > duse < /u > was playing hamlet in london in 1905 , and royalty could not get a ticket . she said , `` i 'm not doing the seven shows a week i signed for . '' she said , `` i can not bare my soul seven times a week . i am an artist . i 'll do four shows a week . '' the greatest actress of her time . you know what her producer said ?

who are these from ?

fuck flowers , we are n't talking about flowers , we 're talking about a human being .

... they treat me like a < u > child < /u > . i , i ... to bare my < u > body < /u > .

yeah . joe ? would you , uh , tell claire the , uh , the `` thoughts '' you 've been ...

i do n't need a cause , just a lawyer .

the girl was in the car .

no , what is it ?

it 's not < u > you < /u > , it 's ...

i do n't getcha .

to the contrary . i want you to tell the truth . the truth is , you ca n't tell me , to a certainty , that you saw the thing . you do n't remember , a gun to your head , which glasses you have on . and you have a fertile imagination . imagination wants to fill in the blanks . now . if you are n't < u > sure < /u > , then they have nothing . bob walks free . as he should . joe : was n't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart . you know ? the people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them , we fear them . and they fear us . because we tell the truth . about our lives . now , this is a damn roust , and everyone knows it ; the guy is looking for a case , he wants to make a name for himself . if we let him do that , if we let him do that , then we 're being false to our community ... to our community , you understand ... ? to our world . cause you are a part of that world , now . you have to take off the steel rolex and put on the gold rolex . and be part of your world . i got a five picture deal with the studio . and you stick with me . you write one , two more , you stick with me , and you 'll < u > direct < /u > the third one . you are a part of this world . it 's in your blood . it 's you . you have to do the right thing : we 're out in the provinces , the sheriff , < u > literally < /u > is at our door . you have to stand with the troops , joe . that 's the bottom line . you < u > have < /u > to ... if you had the leisure to think it through , you 'd see it for yourself . the girl was n't in the car .

he 's got a date , he 's got a date , is this guy fantastic ... ? already he learned how to write a movie , and he found a girl to get his toes curled , what a guy , what a ... what a literary find ... !

why ?

what 's the ...

um , no .

and maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill , i ...

that 's a real < u > fault < /u > , i ...

i know the feeling .

we ca n't shoot the old mill .

i did n't say anything to them .

how do they know that , you told them ?

my oh my .

we got to do something nice for < u > him < /u > .

he 's got a gift for fiction .

it 's a computer comany ... it 's a computer company , < u > bazoomer < /u > - < u > com < /u > ?

< u > find < /u > it .

we do n't have the money .

she wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits .

eight hundred grand to show her tits ...

later for that , walt , let 's get this : we need the `` pages '' for the new `` old mill '' ... alright ? we need a new title , we need a ...

i left that for you .

and , my < u > wife < /u > wanted to , wanted me to ask you , we 'd like to < u > welcome < /u > you , we 'd , she 'd like to have you to dinner at our house . i do n't mean to be ...

only second chance we git , z'ta make the same mistake twice ...

zat true ?

ai n't no second chances in life .

`` assembly of death '' did 95 million dollars the first weekend .

zat what it takes ? i always < u > wondered < /u > what it took ...

you hear that ?

... we ca n't lose the wind ...

we have to lose the window .

where are we ?

& quot ; those who travel far and near this will make you disappear ! & quot ;

i hate the crayon burnt sienna and people who spit when they walk .

good . that 's very good .

i 'm not .

no , that never solves anything . you talk like the big girl you are . about what you feel . and how he 's hurt you . you know ? you tell the truth .

annabelle ... wake up honey ...

this 'll work , huh ?

this is a joke , right ?

he 's not even there . you do n't see him , you do n't hear him , you 're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys .

i call him a fartface or a pervert , or something equally lame .

and what do you do wh ...

... they all yell 'there goes the virgin queen ' or the 'ice princess ' , or some < u > really < /u > clever cut like that . like it hurts my feelings .

i said ...

we make mistakes . and we forgive each other . because we love each other , very m ...

i like talking about it . at least , to you .

oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh ...

i live . in the same country .

during sex .

well , not exactly s ...

i 'm gon na call him .

never say never you always say that . i 'll bet daddy 's mad at me now .

that will never happen .

what happens when he loves rachel more than us ?

it just slipped out .

mass hysteria .

i do n't want that to happen . why would i want that to happen ?

i hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up .

i hate when you say that .

i do n't care .

he 'll be impressed . the clincher is , you < u > walk < /u > away , then < u > whip < /u > around ...

not use my words , please !

and mom says anger never , never < u > solves < /u > anything . it makes every- thing < u > worse < /u > .

no , < u > his < /u > mother 's always on time .

it 's not your < u > fault < /u > ! !

that does n't bother me .

that does n't bother me .

annabelle pick up the phone .

annabelle , i know you miss your mother . so why do n't you say hello .

see , i ...

it 's not to wear around , or any- thing , i 'm < u > way < /u > too young . it 's just for play .

mommy !

he 's not kidnapped he 's -- he 's just hiding -- he 's just -- bennnn ? goddammit !

what if he 's kidnapped ?

i do n't know ... i feel like i 'm gon na throw up .

absolutely duncan i 'm on top of everything .

here .

i did n't forget . i was up all night thinking about it and i concluded you 're too special to look like everyone else . orange red . that 's your color . few can carry it off . now please . help me find your brother .

you do not run out on your moth ...

you owe me a quarter .

is that you ?

well , that 's a long way off , sweetie . we 'll talk to mom and dad ...

how could i be ? we learned some magic ...

& quot ; in the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon ... & quot ;

excuse me --

... eggzactly . i 'm putting on my coat -- we are late . we are seriously late . which means mister ben we 've got to get you dressed --

you touched it .

no , it is n't . because it is n't everything . and we want every- thing , do n't we ?

find the bird cage ?

rache can do that part .

ask her , she 's a heroic fireperson . she does this twenty times a day .

where ben ?

so you 're okay .

pray . we never find out .

no .

are you crazy , you could < u > suffocate < /u > in there ! ! !

thursday 's fine ...

do me a favor ? eat it , and then give me a secret report , okay ? pay particular attention to whether it 's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup .

i 'm somewhere , thinking of you . and meatballs . and you know what ?

people like rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money .

ben , mommies work too . they work very hard . mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working . i just do n't get paid .

i knew where i was all the time .

poof ! you 're happy now .

seven of clubs . nobody 's mad we just want to talk about it .

sooner than later . you really need to .

let 's take our best shot .

so we 'll ... radiate some more ?

every day . more and more .

duncan . i 've got an < u > even < /u > < u > better < /u > idea ...

which part of no do n't you understand ?

i 've got it . it 's in the can , cooper can wrap th ...

but you 're not < u > done < /u > !

yet another spaghetti night .

she 's a charmer , you 'll see . in fifty years , the kids 'll love her ten percent as much as they love you .

and we all went through that together ?

no . you think this is going to help the kids then you do it . you 're on your own .

you ca n't be an 'us ' just when you want to . you ca n't play that card when it 's convenient .

i grew up , a little . i 'm ready for a life that 's built around commitm ...

still , please .

you know the kids are n't really in danger . this is about rachel , and you 're right , i 'm disappointed in her learning curve , and ...

partly . but partly , you 're mad .

our children .

at the big apple circus , it 's the only big top i know . i < u > said < /u > i 'd get 'em back tonight ...

good ... well ... take care .

luke , i need to switch next friday for thursday , so why do n't you take the weekend ... ... that way you 'll be there , and i 'll pick up monday , tuesday , and wednesday .

i 'll call from work . we can have a conference call .

thank you mrs. franklin . jackie ? this has been very valuable for us . and i 'll have a serious talk with annabelle tonight .

we 're not discussing your age .

i 've been with someone for quite some time , and did n't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly . but after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids i might add -- she moved in last month .

i 'm here . i 've got a case where they 're this close to sequestering the jury but have i answered the goddamn thing ? !

i 'm here .

remarried . there is no move .

just sit me up . nice and tall . bring benjamin first .

now edna says you short-changed your last meds . you can do presents and be comfortable at the same time , y'know .

you know every story , every wound , every memory , their whole life 's < u > happiness < /u > has been wrapped up in < u > you < /u > , every moment ...

i was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off . doing my imitation of you .

i never wanted to be a mom . then , sharing it with you was one thing . carrying it alone , the rest of my life ...

no , there is n't .

do n't flatter yourself . i always liked that line .

and there will come < u > another < /u > moment . when the stakes are < u > really < /u > there . and she will look back on this . and remember how good it felt . how easy it was .

she was n't steering her own course , she was steering < u > yours < /u > .

oh please .

you were n't passing 'em out .

you think < u > i < /u > did n't have some dirty words for that little putz ? you think < u > i < /u > could n't figure out some low blows ?

worked . like a charm .

you are < u > defending < /u > what you did ?

and i 'm going to win .

now we 're going to have a fight , you and i .

took 28 hours . she just was n't sure about entering this world .

i know you , huh ? the car pools , he measles , the pta . it 's not gon na be enough for you in the long run . you have to think long term .

it 's just not the right time t ...

... go to the park . in the worst way .

yah ? well , even the best mom in the world , the smartest , the wisest , whatever . needs to know when to find a plan b. cos plan a < u > is < /u > not and < u > will < /u > n ...

and you said ...

the primo stuff is great for pain .

yeh , that 's bull . i 'm going for serene , they say some actually get there .

can i look at the pictures ?

right . which is the whole < u > point < /u > of this 'going out ' thing , so one of them can dump the other one , and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy , without ever having to actually date .

oh , my god .

so i have to tell you something in confidence ...

and cigarettes . i smoke , too .

you 're taking the kids . and moving to san francisco .

i was looking for annabelle 's book , and i found your tickets . and the note . from your new boss .

no way . i told her two , three years , maybe , for such an expens ...

hey . at least it 's not an editing machine .

sorry i 'm late , i got lost dropping ben off at kevin 's .

fine , forget it .

i 'm already on thin ice . yesterday , i actually thought my boss was going to fire me .

i did it for her .

so why did y ...

... in .

i am not < u > here < /u > to make it easier for you . these are < u > my < /u > children . they do n't want to < u > be < /u > with you .

annabelle does n't really want to talk to you right now .

yeh ?

you got to hell !

oh and i do n't because i have a children ? ! the problem is you 're too self-involved to ever be a mother .

you 're damn right . i 'm gon na sick of your imperious bullshit . i never said i was betty fucking crocker . if every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third friday or the month -- go ahead ! i have a life !

i was in there in him .

luke was in the shower this morning and annabelle sort of walked in without knocking .

... a ridiculously < u > expensive < /u > and < u > inappropriate < /u > item , which her father and i have already < u > told < /u > her she is < u > far < /u > too young to own . but < u > you < /u > apparently want to < u > buy < /u > her forgiveness , with ...

what did you do ?

where you goin ' ?

no , here 's ugly . ' i love < u > you < /u > , babe . it 's just our < u > life < /u > together i 'm not so sure about ... '

no , she threw you out . what a difficult woman .

' ... i do n't know if i can make it . ' that 's what i said . but i did n't leave .

excuse me . 'things are so confusing for me , jack . our life feels too comfortable , too safe , too predict- able . it 's a partnership , it 's juggling schedules . when i think of playing that out , every day , for the rest of my life ... '

what do you call it ? you told her you had doubts .

hold your applause . we 're not having fun , here .

what a great surpri ...

i know that .

she 's not gon na die .

are you hungry ? you could make us something ?

it 's anna sui , you should be doing it .

rache , it may take time .

it 's forever you know .

you have n't done < u > one < /u > goddam thing to make any of this easier ...

we have the kids . next weekend .

no you do n't . and i 'm not gon na screw with my kids heads right now --

you do n't trust me to be alone with them .

ca n't handle them myself is what you mean . ca n't .

i can take them to work with me -- i can shift things around --

anyway , i thought ... while i 'm gone ... maybe i 'll hire in some help .

uh-oh . i mention marriage , all of a sudden ... ve < u > haff < /u > to ta ...

the way you cook . if you could make love , i 'd marry you .

okay , if they 're going to < u > have < /u > a sauce , put something < u > in < /u > it besides flour and chicken broth ...

what ?

what if he is ?

oh .

you know ... stanley ...

like what ?

but that could 've happened to him . or to me , if i 'd been alive . or you .

he 's vegetarian , does n't do sports ...

be your sidekick , you know , and maybe eventually become a tv talk- show host .

for rape and murder .

but like , what do you like to do when you 're not working ?

when i 'm in high school i 'm not going to play any football . i 'm just going to concentrate on class rank . what did you do in high school ?

but do you really believe in god ? and heaven , hell and angels and all kind of stuff ?

yes , mikey ?

i mean , without this footage , without this rigorous documentation , it would feel like exploitation .

thanks . i 'll tell mike . well , it 's still just a beginning . i know i can ... dig deeper .

no , you do n't .

you 're showing how superior you are to your subject . toby no , but i like my subject . i like these people .

i was looking through scooby 's sats practice books this afternoon and i took one of the practice tests . guess what score i got ?

he 's right .

not to be crass , but what do we get out of this ?

steak 's really good tonight . scooby good .

we did the same thing last year also .

what are you going to do ?

marcus ... you 'll write something better next time !

you know he hated my story also .

what do you want ?

but it wo n't make any sense if you hear it out of context .

well then , maybe you should just read the ending .

well , i changed the ending a little .

huh ?

i have a cousin . very big giver to the alumni fund .

you 're absolutely right . the focus is on the college admissions process today .

ok .

whaddya wan na talk about ?

the same .

what do you know ?

you 're welcome . dad ? would you let me try hypnotizing you now ?

maybe he 's that one in a million !

i just want to know what the hell he 's doing in his room that 's so interesting he does n't come down for dinner .

again ! !

'fuck me hard ! '

nigger .

no .

can i join you ?

uh huh .

ah-hah . and how is it you hope to achieve this goal ?

ok .

eight , six , and four .

oh . tired of 'life in the fast lane ' ?

yeah . but not any more .

yeah . you did n't wan na take me to the prom .

oh ? anything i might have seen ?

that 's good . so then what do you do now ?

yeah , well , it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off , so , uh ... so i dropped out .

that 's what i was gon na ask you .

hello , is this pam ?

you want some ?

yeah . i know .

thanks .

yeah . he went to harward .

whoopee .

times up !

y-yes --

th-th-they 'll kill one hostage every hour until it is --

i now understand the expression `` you get what you pay for ! '' a bunch of chumps !

cooper ...

what do you mean ?

we 're outta here --

i said i 'll lead .

the maintenance hatch -- it takes us outside the building !

where does it lead ?

i do n't see why they would n't be .

how well do you know this place ?

i do n't want any ...

i suppose ... you think i should thank you .

you understand that they 're watching our every move right now -- you think you 're just going to sail away ?

good .

came over the satellite . we 're keeping the bird clear should they call back .

i have n't been briefed on any such thing !

is there anything in there that can blow ? we have to be ready for any contingency --

so , what are we looking at white ?

we 're almost done piping in directly to the olympia . should have it all in about an hour or so .

where the hell could they have gone !

excellent ... excellent !

richter-we got a problem !

i know what i 'm here for-you do n't need to remind me .

have you broken it yet ? we 've got six more heads and that means six more hours .

if i do n't get power up we are !

are we adrift --

you know , when we reach kompong som --

they must have got their hands on a test vial !

of the separate chemicals -- i do n't know , uh , offhand --

and now , mister president , i must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the premier .

and surely you do n't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons .

bah ! all you wanted to do was spy in our country !

damn you , de sade ! you know as well as i do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual , whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country .

allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people .

the source was ... shall we say , completely reliable .

first of all , economic reasons . it was cheap . the entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs . it also seemed ideal in most other respects . it was terrifying , convincing , automatic , and extremely simple to understand .

our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices , jacketed in cobalt-thorium-g would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape . in ten months the earth would be as dead as the moon .

well , it has been explained to me that , if you add a thick cobalt-thorium-g jacket to a nuclear device , the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years .

i am sorry . sub-miniature photography is my hobby . it 's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative .

at his office in the capitol .

now , mister ambassador . in a very few moments we should have premier belch on the phone . i intend to tell him exactly what has happened . i merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him .

moffo !

all right , mister ambassador ! but you must treat general `` buck '' schmuck with the respect due him .

war-mongering bully ! do n't think you 're going to intimidate me !

please be calm , ambassador de sade .

it 's not a he , general . it was an article in the `` times '' about a year and a half ago .

do you mean to say you 'd set it off in your own country ?

what do you think of this , mister president ? i told you we should n't let him in here .

the three-letter code group . or maybe some combination of the three letters . p ... o ... e , or p ... e ... o , or e ... o ... p ... let 's see , there would be six possible combinations .

why are you saying that phrase over and over again ?

major ? ... major ? i 'm colonel `` bat '' guano , 701 battalion .

well , i 'm general ripper 's executive officer . he 'll want to talk to me .

what about the president ?

look , colonel . maybe it 's too late . maybe they 've sent air command in already . but we 've got to try to con- tact somebody .

they told me , major . and i did n't hear anything about any atomic attack .

colonel , do n't you know what 's going on ?

what happened , major ? some kind of private beef between the two of you ?

ceida pietraszkiewicz .

i know it sounds crazy , sir , but we tried , and nobody answers any of the telephones .

i did n't say anything . what 's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour , colonel ?

what did you say , sir ?

go back to sleep , baby .

to be perfectly honest , mister president , we really are n't sure .

general schmuck ?

well , sir , about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders , general jack d. ripper , sent out attack orders to the thirty-four b-90 's of the 843rd bomb wing , under his command .

what kind of trouble ?

i am aware of what a condition red alert implies .

as soon as you 've done that , shut down the communications center . lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details .

no , sir . plan-r to be radioed to the wing .

i understand , sir . nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so .

that 's right , sir .

yes , major . this looks like it 's going to be it .

that 's right . i want this flashed to all section immediately .

condition red !

good . has the wing confirmed holding at x-points ?

why do you think i ask ?

peace on earth .

to peace on earth , major .

yes , sir . why do n't you stop the fighting , sir ?

major , i hate to say this , but i think you 've been enemy indoctrinated , and you do n't even know it .

no , sir . i 'm sure we would n't .

and you 'd like to see that ?

but , general , we 're on our toes . we have n't agreed to anything for years . inffact , a a lot of people say we never will .

major , you 're talking like one of them !

gee , sir , that last remark does n't exactly make all the sense in the world .

major mandrake , i guess you do n't follow what 's going on too closely , do you ?

but if you just let things alone , we would n't lose anyone .

i know so , major . i know so . and add to that , the whole air command force being committed to clobber everything they 've got .

our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy , would n't they ?

but then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people , sir ?

that 's close enough , major .

i see .

i do n't think so , sir .

no , sir . i mean i did n't think you had n't given it a lot of thought .

i 've given it alot of thought , major . do n't think i have n't .

perfect . thank you , major . and now let 's drink a toast .

just a squirt .

you 're damned right they are .

we 've come a long way since world war ii , major . and the lessons we 've learned are all in plan-r .

i know that , sir .

well , general ripper , sir -- i was thinking -- we 're on a condition red , are n't we ?

i see you 're playing your radio , major . is n't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base ?

that 's right , major .

please do n't take any notice of this weapon , major . i love all weapons , and as of late , i 've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times .

what 's the gun for , general ripper ?

general , stick to the point , please .

is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy air defense , when its course and target are known ?

well , the premier doped it out pretty well . its primary is their missile base at laputa .

what 's the target .

have you tried the recall again ?

hello , are you still there ? ... uh-huh ... i 'll be right back . we 're still working this thing out .

general faceman , what was the name of the officer who called me from burpelson ?

how long will it take to receive them all ?

i do n't think that 's a fair analogy , sir .

then there 's no chance for recall ?

and i suppose you 're going to tell me you do n't know what the three-letter code is .

once the orders have been given , plan-r requires any new orders to be received on the crm-114 in the aircraft . but the crm-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group .

and i suppose there 's some reason why you have n't recalled them ?

well , what about the positive control , the safety catch ? do n't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order ?

all right ... we 're still flying . i 'm taking her down to the deck .

roger . one-three-eight .

yeah , to see if we 're on our toes .

he 's right . we would n't have started it .

sure , i 'll take her up to eight hundred .

sorry , king . my leg 's stiff as a board .

they 're moving apart .

must be mach two-five stuff . altitude fifteen thousand .

roger .

look , ca n't someone help me ?

yeah , i got it in the thigh .

maximum ecm !

war ?

war .

some kind of signaling .

where 'd they get you ?

okay . check these points . complete radio silence . to ensure that the enemy ca n't plant false transmissions and fake orders , the crm-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits . the three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the crm-114 , which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters . you got it ?

hey , king . somebody at burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor .

sure , king .

listen , lothar . you know that crack i made about your ... butt ?

i thought i 'd go along for the ride .

roger .

well , it would probably help if you took it ... sort of ... straight down .

let me check .

but i told you , i do n't think we can get the bomb bay doors open .

lothar , can you arm the bombs for impact ?

well , i ca n't get out and look , king . but i do n't get a green light .

well , i hate to say this , but i think the bomb bay doors are stuck .

who 's that ?

first lesson in war college : never under- estimate your enemy .

you 're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball .

there are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose .

take it easy , major kong .

right . so how could we get any messages ?

the crm-114 is smashed , right ?

how the hell do i know ? maybe the war 's over .

why should they call us back ?

they must have gotten it from the base . no one else would know it .

well , we sure as hell are n't going home just because the enemy tells us to .

where 'd they get you ?

i bit his jugular vein . now will you shut up and get up here ? ? ?

binky ?

master safety on .

all right , lothat , that does it . master safety on now until bomb run .

seond safety .

release first safety .

when do you want to arm the bomb for the primary , major ?

check , all bomb circuits green . okay , lothar .

what 's your point , lothar ?

our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities , right ?

when they emerge , a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable , if they are moth-balled in advance . i would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years .

a special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed , but off-hand , i should say that in addition to the factors of youth , health , sexual fertility , intelligence , and a cross-section of necessary skills , it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included , to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition .

it would not be difficult . nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely . greenhouses could maintain plant life . animals could be bred and slaughtered . a quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country , but i should n't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd . every nation would undoubtedly follow suit .

yeah , it would suck big time . i 'd kill myself first .

i mean , that would suck if you had to go back to rehab .

in group ?

you know , one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense .

knock yourself out .

mn-hm .

we are ?

uh , yeah , she should be coming by .

yeah , i talked to your mom . i think i woke her up . i hope i did n't get you in trouble .

yes .

i stand for something . and i 'm trying to communicate something .

behind me . i 'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff .

that was really great .

do you wan na go to the van ?

mm . hey , what are you doing now ?

sounds like a bummer .

any gunshot victims ?

your a nurse ?

oh .

yeah , when 's he coming ?

no .

guess not .

bullshit .

she 's dead ?

what she doin ' in the van , man ?

she 's in the van .

hey , man .

what ?

no . it did n't , buff .

no , shut up ! look , look , alright , tim is in trouble .

oh , and guess who showed up .

no , i know what you 're going to say . i do n't know anything about making a video . but that 's a plus .

no , look , this is not about sooze , alright . wait , wait , wait , wait . she stayed at the four seasons last night with pony ?

i feel really bad about that , but i was busy , you know , i mean ...

buff , look at me for a second . no , this is serious .

hey , you know me .

uh , buff , i 'm , i 'm , gon na tell you something and , uh , you got , you got , you got ta promise not to tell anyone , alright ?

no . life is too short .

no , i 'm not , i 'm not worried . i 'm not worried .

hey . hey . are you trying to get a hold of sooze ?

no , no .

in the limo ! ! !

fuck it !

... idiot ! open the damn door ! go , go , go , come on !

a long , long , long , long , while .

yeah , a long while . a long , long while .

oh , come on , man . tell me you would n't love it !

same , more of the same . yep , just keep doing the same thing all the time , around and around the clock . with an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy . then , instead of watching gilligan , we 'd watch captain kirk .

i would n't . if i were in his shoes , every morning i 'd get up singing , man . do my work-out , take a shower , followed by a hearty breakfast , steak and eggs , washed down with a pot of hot coffee , six pack of coors lite . then i 'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe , who would appear decked out in her all-black leather victoria secret custom-made bodysuit . so i 'd , like , have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude . except she 'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em . and then she 'd take out this half-ounce of blow , we 'd snap out a few mondo lines , vaporize a few million brain cells , screw for about an hour , then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching gilligan .

i 'd get bored .

oh , yeah , yeah . wait , um , how do you figure that ?

the dude wants it .

yes !

pony 's coming here to the corner ? !

it 's your birthday ?

your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie .

you should get upset . everyone should get upset . when , when hitler was greasing the jews , people were saying , `` do n't get me upset . your bumming me out . '' my duty as a human being is to be pissed off . jesus christ , not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place . nothing ever changes , man . fifty years from now we 're all gon na be dead and there 'll be new people standing here drinking beer , eating pizza , bitching and moaning about the price of oreos , and they wo n't even know we were ever here . and then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there 'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they 're doing on this fucking planet and they 'll all be full of shit . it 's all so fucking futile .

hey , come on , man ! limo !

jeff ! let 's go !

fuck her ! come on , let 's go .

i 'm just gon na go . i figure the worst i can do is starve to death .

buff , please , would you jus fuck off , okay ? fuck off !

so , how was the ride , kids ?

come on man .

you better ! yes !

playing with something really hot . yeah .

yes ! free concert !

am i fucking him ?

mm . and your like , what else ?

oh , you were in the band ?

yeah , well , uh , you 're not so smart , chief , 'cause i 'm moving out to l.a .

yeah it 's okay . you know , we have a saying back home : `` either the salt is rotten or the meat . ''

you 're wife sucks my cock every night , swallows my cum and loves it . that 's okay .

i 'll tell you what . when i get my engineering degree and i 'm swimming in my swimming pool , it will be very fucking okay .

it 's okay .

look , look , i 'm not joking around now , okay ? come on , let 's go , let 's go !

please !

we 're your customers . we 're not complaining .

this is private property , my friend .

yo ! your spitting rice all over us ! god .

hey , play that demo again , man . alright .

i mean , do you have something i could show my manager ? i mean , do you have a reel ?

yeah .

`` closed , closed , closed . '' but with your music .

no , no , whoa !

yeah , we 're all above that .

oh , so what about her ?

okay . we 'll go for a ride .

okay .

alright , get in the car before i have to embarrass you in front of your friend .

uh , you know , just admiring the scenery , you know ?

taking care of business .

that 's what i mean .

it 's nice to do a lot of things .

erica . so do you think you and i are alike , erica ?

you know , it was the biggest mistake of my life .

you got everything right but the car . my dad did n't get me a bmw .

he is .

he is ?

hi .

it 's nice here . it 's different .

pony and i are friends .

yeah , she , uh , works for the record company and takes care of interviews and , you know , shit like that , uh , we were actually just doin ' an interview and erica said she 's like to see burnfield , so ...

mm .

oh , yeah , it was a great show . you guys missed it .

i mean , we 've been playing big places everywhere , but when we did that sound check at the orpheum , it suddenly hit me . i 'm playing the orpheum , you know ? i mean , the last time i played here was , uh , the prom .

two-fifty ? they go up ?

two-fifty .

hey , w-why do n't you see if he 's hiring , you know ? get an application ?

just put it down .

you do n't know ?

you know , and what are you doing here in the first place , man ? he 's just gon na call the cops again .

you want to know what your problem is , jeff ? you want to believe so bad , you 'll buy anything . it 's true . look at you . you 're gullible and you 're gutless .

what 'd you do ?

no , no . i 'm not , i 'm not talking about this . i did a bad thing , jeff .

yeah , fuck 'em .

well , it ai n't no pup tent in the garage , you know what i mean ? fuck . so they 'll talk and talk . they 'll probably talk all night . and , oh , they 'll decide that they 're gon na spend the night together , right ? but , you know , they 're gon na keep their underwear on and they 're not gon na do anything . by six a.m. he 's parking the pink cadillac . fuck . there 's really only one answer .

yeah . yeah , no , you 're right . it 's no big deal , you know . guy probably has his arm around her right now , holding her close , nudging her titty with his elbow , talking about the deep significance of his music , while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes . in a few minutes they 'll be back at the four seasons . you ever , you ever stayed in one of those places ?

if it 's all so fucking futile , what the fuck are you so fucking upset about , fuckhead ?

look , look , just get off my property .

i do n't know .

just go .

do your covers and all that shit .

i do n't know . and i do n't care that i do n't know .

wait . what , what are you saying ?

for a ride .

wait , wait , wait a minute , sooze . what are you doing ?

god , you smell like whiskey .

mm .

gee , jeff , i thought you were gon na go take a piss , not join some alcoholic nudist colony .

hey , where did you go ? we were worried about you .

oh , hi . i thought you guys got lost .

why do n't you just try ? please . for me . come on .

no . no , no , no .

come on .

jeff !

fuck ! pony , if we wanted to hear you sing , we would 've gone to your concert !

you do .

so you and i can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the sizzler ? what are we doing , jeff ? you and me ?

no , no .

so , what , why ca n't you do that here ? what 's wrong with here ? why is somewhere else better ?

and ?

what ?

it was a racial incident .

um , because you did n't want to go .

well , if you love him so much , why did n't you go see him play ?

can i talk here ? let me talk .

no , idealism is guilty , middle class bullshit .

your completely missing the point .

so you can give me more shit ?

no , no , no . y-you know what ? y-your packing your bags , you 're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age , so he tells you you have talent .

your sure as hell right about that .

i do n't know .

oh , no , no . uh , uh , george , pull over .

i got ta take a piss . do you mind if we pull over really quickly ?

well , i , i did n't say i was special , but it 's one thing , you know , and it 's another thing to actually communicate it to people . you know what i mean ? if a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it , does that make a sound ?

for a while .

great .

like songs ?

so you think i should ?

i dropped out . i mean , uh , you know , this semester i 'm taking a , a class , you know , three nights a week . but i 'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff. , you know ? i 've been doing some writing , though . short pieces , you know .

oh , man , we were pretty on tonight .

hey , i though you guys were coming to the show , man ?

yeah , good .

yeah , i crash there .

yeah .

yeah , yeah . yeah , the record company , they make me use it , you know . i mean , it 's dumb , i know , it 's just ...

well , shit , man , you 've only been gone for a year , man , is that your limo ?

wow , man . the corner . i mean , nothing 's changed .

no , no , she went up by herself . this was not my responsibility .

hey , you know what ? go fuck yourself .

pakistani . okay ? we 're from pakistan .

well , what about this ?

well , you got ta call your wife then , you know , 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway , right ?

nobody 's fucking anybody !

is that jeff ?

yeah , you know , when you called i thought , there 's a name from the past .

me ?

that 's because i am .

i do n't know . i say what i mean .

no , i 'm going .

yeah . burnfield , pizza and puke capital of the world .

you know , that is my worst fear . making a sound and no one hears it .

oh , no , man . i ca n't .

yeah , come on , play it .

yeah .

yeah .

you 're not serious .

hey , pony , this is my friend bee-bee .

i do . jeff , do n't you think sooze should go to new york and , uh , you know .

yeah . to go to school and , you know , paint , performances , paint .

you showed up . oh , my god ! holy shit ! look at this car , man !

well , just , you know , have 'em call me . y-you know where to find me , right ?

... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say aa , okay ?

no , see , neil , if you 're fucking with one of my friends , then you 're fucking with me .

whatever .

about what ?

well , i called erica 's beeper . there 's just no answer .

oh , how 'd she get back ?

where do you get your ideas ?

so where are you ?

it 's not the air force anymore , scuff

tim 's jealous , you know ? he wants to have ideas too .

you know the fuck not .

oh for chrissakes ... `` white trash betty . '' i did n't realize the rules went into effect before we entered safeway .

look , it 's really not my fault .

this is great - great ! now we have to enter the front door !

you have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wan na run up and down the stairs . shit - i forgot to pick up the cigarettes .

i ca n't believe your grandparents never come down here .

you piece-a-shit bug zapper !

wait ! did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant ... you had it , threw it out and you 're gon na go back and dance all night !

can you guys believe this ? we 're like celebrities !

and you know real cops are n't half as smart as keanu .

hello ?

everything 's fine . i 'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down .

di , are you okay ? we can skip the girl party this week .

she thinks you went to the police .

but , we have to make a smart plan !

look , i might be moody . i might be gassy . but i am perfectly sane . think about it . in school , they tell us , `` dreams can come true . '' right ?

you sure ?

oh my g-d , you 've been robbed !

diane ? diane !

if you reach for the stars , you 're bound to get -- mm-jack , pull over .

mmm-hmmm ...

i never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch . baby , we are living the great american dream !

ah ! i almost forgot gas for the baby machine . i 'll grab your snickers and get a place in line .

i know , but that was before .

but we agreed your job is running the baby machine ...

if you could be count chocula , frankenberry or trix the rabbit , who 'd you be ?

jack ...

jack , sweetie , i 'm only eating for two .

oh , jack ...

i see a flower . and y'know , even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt .

sorry . my hands are tied .

i 'm sorry .

oh - okay , we ai n't done with this ... those babies are gon na get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load ! we 're gon na learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals ! i 'm gon na visit my mom !

di , it 's not your fault . we all wanted to do this - for you ... for ourselves .

it 's all my fault . i 'm sorry i ever started this ...

anyway , last time i checked , you still had to have sex to have an orgasm . and i know she ai n't seen the lord on all fours - so i 'm just saying .

yeah ?

fern ! c'mere ! she 's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose .

hey , hey , hey . c'mon you guys . obviously that 's a little more than our budget will allow . basically , we 're looking for something around two-hundred dollars .

yeah ?

it was n't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they 'd lived ! oh g-d , i 'm gon na be someone 's bald bitch !

we 're dead ! they showed this prison movie to my youth group on sunday .

hello ?

look , maybe i can watch a pg movie ... i 'll just say i 'm counting dirty words for sunday school .

you damn well better ...

kansas ?

maybe we can make a deal .

definitely old .

really ...

bank branch !

you sure you wan na go there ?

am i the only one who cares about this ? at least i watched `` dog day afternoon ! ''

oh my g-d ! i 'm not first !

hold up , hold up . any sentence that starts with `` at church camp '' ai n't leading to the big `` o . ''

well technically , i do n't think i 'm a virgin anymore .

okay , you ca n't tell anybody .

they could kill you .

thank g-d. i was starting to think i 'd killed the wrong man .

grandma and grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl . they did n't want you to break out and come kidnap me .

i want to help . i 'm part of this squad ...

stop it ! this is crazy !

i mean it . i 'm in . this is the closest thing to a goddamn family that i 've ever had . if one of us needs something , we all do .

we 're ready with the shot , mr. demille .

i can tell her you 're all tied up in the projection room . i can give her the brush ...

it must be about that appalling script of hers . what can i say to her ? what can i say ?

the greatest . they call me the elsa maxwell of the assistant directors . hey , easy on the punch bowl . budget only calls for three drinks per extra . fake the rest .

good party .

in a deep freeze .

hi , artie .

well , what do you know ! joe gillis !

i just think pictures should say a little something .

name dropper .

nothing for ladd ?

nobody asked you to .

look , sweetie -- be practical . l 've got a good thing here . a long-term contract with no options . i like it that way . maybe it 's not very admirable . well , you and artie can be admirable .

all right . i 'll give you a few more clues .

want something to drink ? there 's always champagne on ice , and plenty of caviar .

i do n't know why i 'm so scared , joe . is it something awful ?

of course i love him . i always will . i 'm just not in love with him any more .

why do n't you ? we can finish the script by thursday .

he wants me to come on to arizona . he says it only oosts two dollars to get married there . it would kind of save us a honeymoon .

i just do n't .

why not ?

something came up . i do n't want to talk about it .

twenty-two .

may i say you smell real special .

not once . what 's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras ? it 's really more fun .

sure . especially with lots of music underneath , drowning it out .

oh , you --

i 'm not good enough to write it alone . we 'll have to do it together .

where 's the story ? i bluffed it out with a few notions of my own . it 's really just a springboard . it needs work .

into something for barbara stan- wyck . they have a commitment with barbara stanwyck .

into what ? a lampshade ?

sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher .

is that so ? what 's the wonderful news ?

you do n't know how glad i am to see youl

how about the rainbow room ?

sure . bases loaded .

let me help you . betty schaeter , sheldrake 's office .

you know , crazy things happen in this business . i hope you have n't lost your sense of humor ...

and if you had n't been pretty darned interested in that script , he would n't have tried to get me on the phone ten times .

what assistant ?

then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants .

that 's no excuse . you read the script , did n't you ?

norma , i want to apologize for not calling you .

hello , young fellow .

it 's got a lot of good things . of course , it would be an expensive picture ...

we 'll be working again , wo n't we , chief ? we 'll make our greatest picture .

what 's the matter , norma ?

goodbye . norma .

you think i made that up about the gun ...

the rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer .

max is a good idea . he can help with my luggage . thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe . and thanks for the use of all the trinkets .

no you did n't . you took the car .

good .

i was a little worried about the line of my throat . this woman has done wonders with it .

nothing is the matter . i 'm having a great time . show me some more .

you 're a darling .

pull up at the drugstore , will you , max . i 'll get you some .

i 'll do it again , i 'll do it again , i 'll do it again !

not until you promise to act like a sensible human being .

why do n't you just say thank you and go , go , go --

it sure would have made attractive headlines : great star kills her- self for unknown writer .

to fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing .

why not ? what i 'm trying to say is that i 'm all wrong for you . you want a valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --

what right ? do you want me to tell you ?

what right do you have to take me for granted ?

i own three blocks downtown . i have oil in bakersfield -- pumping , pumping , pumping . what 's it for but to buy us anything we want .

there are no other guests . we do n't want to share this night with other people . this is for you and me .

the other guests ?

it 's those feathers . they tickle .

should n't we wait for the others ?

cute . let 's have some drinks .

now , i 'm not going to wear ear- rings , i can tell you that .

you know , to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit .

joe , you look absolutely divine . turn around !

of course you do . a tuxedo and tails .

that 's a dreadful shirt you 're wearing .

oh ... and i thought it was a matter of life and death .

i 've lost my car .

not now , my dear . i 'm playing three no trump .

i want to talk to you for a minute .

cut away from me ?

now , now , do n't let 's be small about such matters . we wo n't keep books . go on , unpack mr. gillis ' things .

it 's all taken care of . it 's all paid for .

oh no . i could n't let it out of my house . you 'll have to finish it here .

december twenty-first .

of course not . but it ought to be organized . just an editing job . you can find somebody .

of course it is .

they will love it every place . read it . read the scene just before she has him killed !

the wind gets in that blasted pipe organ . i ought to have it taken out .

and you have written pictures , have n't you ?

yeah ?

get out !

i knew there was something wrong with them .

get out .

and she 's turned you into a servant .

she never will . that is my job . it has been for a long time . you must understand i discovered her when she was eighteen . i made her a star . i can not let her be destroyed .

it 's just that i 'm very worried about madame .

what is it , max ? want to wash the car , or are you doing a little spying in your off hours ?

i do n't know , sir . madame made the arrangements .

you send them . is that it , max ?

they found your car in the garage . they are going to tow it away .

good .

some men are here . they asked for you .

thanks . say , she 's quite a character , that norma desmond .

i made your bed this afternoon .

madame is waiting .

suppose you listen just for a minute -

wipe your feet !

what car ?

we 've come for the car .

that 's right .

joseph c. gillis ?

look , mr. sheldrake , could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself , as a personal loan ?

there 's nothing , gillis . not even if you were a relative .

any kind of assignment . additional dialogue .

now wait a minute . if we made it a girls ' softball team , put in a few numbers . might make a cute musical : it happened in the bull pen -- the story of a woman .

mr. sheldrake , i do n't want you to think i thought this was going to win any academy award .

bases loaded . there 's a 4o-page outline .

all right , gillis . you 've got five minutes . what 's your story about ?

greatest thing that could happen to you . now you 'll have to sit behind that typewriter . now you 'll have to write .

forget romanoff 's . it 's the car i 'm talking about . if i lose my car it 's like having my legs out off .

gillis , get this through your head . i 'm not just your agent . it 's not the ten per cent . i 'm your friend .

was theft involved ? did you catch him trying to steal something , or find he had stolen something ?

did the deceased ever threaten you ? were you in fear of bodily injury ?

did he have a wife ? did he had a girl friend ? did you know them ?

oh , yes , yes . they 're below , waiting for the princess ... i 'm ready .

thank you , max .

paramount is calling .

but what will happen ?

how can you create beauty ... with a selfish heart ? the spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl 's head , buzzing angrily . her look of delight turns to fear . she tries to shoo the creature away . it flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city .

it 's big . and empty . i 'm tired of limiting myself to argo city . i want to do something new . i 'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy , glittery stuff ... .

at last . ultimate power .

is it her that 's bothering you -- or your gardener ?

yes , of course , it was foolish of me .

yes ! you own the coffer of shadow . nothing can withstand its power .

i came as quickly as i could . what is the danger ?

have fun .

is he your entertainment for tonight ?

sorry , mistress .

and then , like great cats -- -we pounce ! and destroy !

drive on . we have already attracted enough attention .

but which one ?

the coffer of shadow . look at it .

maybe it was just an accident .

you think so ?

and now ?

what i had before . what 's not there now . it 's like i woke up and found part of me was n't there any more : something that made me feel really alive and aware of things . it was like , for the first time in my life , everything fitted together perfectly -- -you and me and the world around us -- like we were a wonderful song ...

miss what ?

but i do n't understand .

because you remind me of all the dumb things i said .

but why ?

i do n't love you any more .

great ! i'ii build a house -- right over there , with a veranda looking out to sea . and i 'll plant a garden ! papayas , pineapples , bananas , mangoes -- - anything 'll grow here . and i'ii fish in the lagoon , and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe , and -- -

terrific .

is this how ?

let me kiss you .

we 're from different worlds .

we ca n't do that .

i 'll be safe with you . we can stay together the rest of our lives .

but be reasonable . if i do n't do something to stop her she 'll try again . and maybe hurt you .

let 's talk about us , not her .

it 's not important . the important thing is i 'm here to find something and i think you can he1p me .

my angel . my goddess . i feel i 've always loved you all my life . i 'll die if i ca n't spend the rest of my life just looking at you , holding you in my arms ...

you 're alive ! she did n't kill you !

when can i see , you again ?

do n't leave me .

i 'm taking you to the hospital .

remember me ? we were in a disaster together .

guess ! go on .

you vicious --

come back to my house . my car 's outside .

i do n't want your help .

this is your problem , right here . this girl 's driving you insane , ethan . let me help you .

and you think you 're in love .

they think i have a concussion .

what an adorable hat .

to us . and to the seeds we 'll plant together .

well , just one .

you must be very popular in the neighborhood . i always see your truck parked around .

call me next week . maybe we can have lunch .

i 've got things to do .

why george , are you proposing ?

better eat it quick . it wo n't look too pretty when it 's all covered with ants .

you sure are a good cook , selena . man , that looks too pretty to eat .

i believe there 's a rational explanation for everything . but i do n't know what it is .

how lucy and that guy got to the hospital . and all that damage at the school . the police are calling it a freak tornado . i 'd like to interview you for the daily- -

why did n't you tell me ?

you were ? you mean we could 've been ... you-know-what ... all this time ?

i wish they 'd tell us what they 're going to do with us .

lucy ! be serious . we could be executed for treason !

as brave as my father . as wise .

why have n't you been able to contact him ? he should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago . he may be dead . zor-el but what can you , a mere girl-

it was my fault . you are n't old enough to use the wand . i should n't have given it to you .

where is earth ?

it 's something they have on earth . you know , where your cousin went .

what are you making :

again ? you 're getting real tight with them . you 're gon na be a straight-a student -- -just kidding , thanks for coming .

listen , i know i 've been saying you ought party more , but keep your hands off this one , will yak ? he 's private property . i 've been waiting years for him to develop .

mr. danvers called . i 'll get a new one with the insurance money . b.f.d .

lucy ; come back !

why is he acting so strangely ?

you sure ?

keep an eye peeled for myra . she 's out to get you .

thank you . you 're very kind .

i 'd rather not talk about it .

sure . mate in five moves .

what ? me ?

i 'd love to .

what can i do for you ?

oh , yes . knocking . the pre-entry signal . i forgot .

why get rid of her at al1 ? you 've used the coffer of shadow too much . it is beginning to rule your heart .

you would ! you revealed our existence so you could have all of our power .

i was just thinking , if i had your skin problems , i 'd use a good tannisroot ointment . every night .

... trust the wisdom of the ancients , trust the great mother to protect us ... why . are you staring at me like that ?

throw him out .

you think you are on top now . well there is someone coming to challenge you . i saw it in the cards this morning .

i need you like an eskimo needs a lawnmower . now burn rubber .

you need me , selena . i 'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate .

cigarette ?

you 're going to pay a terrible price . the power of shadow is tricky . use it too much and it takes over .

i 'm free . i can never thank you enough .

you 've run out of things to throw , selena .

i do n't scare that easily .

i am selena . give him to me . now . or you 'll both be sorry .

who are you ?

it 's selena . i 'm getting so i can recognise her work .

you can use the wand .

not doing this for you . just sick of this place , that 's all . wretched singing sculptures , always yowling at you . boring !

leave the zone ? what would i do on earth ?

then come with me .

but it 's impossible .

there 's no way out of the zone . no one 's ever escaped . that 's why they send the criminals here .

but what about other people ? do n't you miss them ?

what ? palace ? hardly .

well , nothing we can do about it . come into my house . you can stay with me , until i build you your own place . i expect you wo n't want to mix with the others -- not our type of people .

it 's dangerous to use a power source on earth . it can unleash all sorts of terrible forces -- -

this is the phantom zone . but why did you come here from argo city ?

nope . never .

man , you do n't never pass out , do ya ?

brad .

first the supplier could n't find the invoice . then the order came up short . then i missed the four o'clock plane from cleveland and had to rent a car , and then i got a darn flat tire on the highway ! can you beat it ? boy , your boss must 've been furious when i did n't show up by the end of the day today , huh ?

for a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team , you sure got a big mouth , kent .

say , brad . i think he 'll be better off doing it his way .

hiya , sweet thing . little guy 's getting ' hassled , huh ? kent , you still here ?

brad wilson .

anyday ...

lana , i 'm from metropolis . i see superman every day .

uh-huh .

can i help ?

oh , i would n't want to -- i mean , i 'd want to , but i would n't want to ... be a nuisance to you .

that 's the biggest change in smallville , you know . they 've taken over this town . everybody who is n't actually working for wheat king -- like i do -- is out there -- on a wheat king thresher . do you think i could do it ? do you ?

no . i mean , yes they are , but i was talking about that . wheat king . bet your bottom dollar that 's a wheat king thresher .

no , thanks .

there 's a lot of choices here .

clark , i think you worry too much about mayonnaise .

it is n't only that he 's small for his age . how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father ? look at him , he 's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon .

but lana , you could --

no , the problem is -- why do i stay in smallville ? believe me , i 've asked myself the same question . do you know how lucky you are to live in metropolis ? the big apricot .

too much mayonnaise ?

you 'd be surprised how many offers i did n't get . even brad would n't stick around for this . it really is n't easy .

and here i am , just standing here . that 's terrible . thank you .

you look wonderful .

kent !

-- but you deserve the vacation , lois .

please , kent , not now . i 'm trying to put out a newspaper here .

sure .

what !

mom and i do this all the time .

well ... not quite like this .

i 'd better be . suddenly i 've got competition to keep up with . your high school reunion article . i though it was terrific . and fascinating . especially about the girl back home . i 'll tell you what , clark , i 'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it .

exactly what i was about to ask about me .

wow , what a beautiful sunrise !

what 's that ?

i know , i 'm the fault .

not counting this week . you secured employment last june as a messenger and were discharged after one day for . . .

ah yes , august gorman . have you looked for work this week , mr. gorman ?

gus gorman .

say who ?

quittin ' time , gus . comin ' ?

one . and a half .

how many sugars ?

join the party , genius ! come on up !

ai n't nobody gon na mess with my machine ! i 'll ... i 'll ... what will i do ? i 'll build in a counter-punch ! anything attacks it gets counter- attacked ! and wiped out !

but a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies . people who will want to destroy it .

exactly . stoned mother .

gus , it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here . we are talking unlimited power . we are talking `` get-down hot-cha daddy-o '' whatever you called it .

tell me more ...

anything .

everything .

not like this one you ai n't . nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it do n't exist yet . we got to build it .

a computer .

fair 's fair .

you catch on fast , old buddy . tell him about the pumps . i know how you love the part about the pumps .

huh ?

greed ! let me tell you something -- -

that 's what i been thinkin ' about . how you been keepin ' me . i ai n't getting ' nothing outta this gig .

it ai n't . it 's nowhere . it blew up . that 's how come they shipped the dude to earth when he was a baby . well . i know some stuff too , y'all .

just the man i wanted to see !

what ?

yeah , yeah , i can do it .

like everything else in the 20th century , gus . you push buttons .

destroy the entire colombian coffee crop down to the last bean .

i 'm tryin ' to .

yes ! that never occurred to me . her ya go , buddy , single-malt . gus , my friend , you 're a genius . okay , a naughty genius , but hell , nobody 's perfect .

or socks .

yeah ? what do you do with 'em ?

thanks . let 's go

whatcha wan na stop here for ? not that i ai n't glad to be on the ground , y'understand .

we gon na crash ?

you will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the atlantic ocean .

what she call you ?

oh bubba , think of the possibilities .

that 's his sister . vera webster .

well ... i guess they did get a little carried away .

ricky ? where ... what ...

the picture looks blurry .

that was n't me . that guy 's gone . and you 're next webster .

i do n't know you , lady .

but how ? where 's it getting the power from ? ? ? !

i ca n't ! it 's out of control !

cut the mush , lorelei . he 's after our skin !

where do you usually find a light switch ?

so i understand from the graffiti i 've seen .

why stop at coffee ! a cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning , but what keeps the world working ?

it 's modern . it 's up-to-date . it 's state-of-the art . people , i am in love with this machine . go ahead , mr. white .

mr. white , you be in this shot , handing them their plane tickets .

you 've got to pick three more numbers .

okay ? goodbye .

53 .

why ca n't the idiot in circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place -- -

mr. white , please , it 's time for you to draw this month 's winning jingo number . the prize is an all-expenses trip to south america .

hello .

it 's your genius , pal ! you built a machine that can find anybody 's weak spot , just like you said .

do n't bet on it !

he 's the only one who can operate this --

who needs gus ?

we can get to work on that oil !

and now that superman 's out of the nice guy business ...

a normal person .

nice try , butch , but it would n't be effective against superman . you 'll see ! now that he 's pulled this stunt , he 'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one , too ! i 've got to get rid of him ! i 've got to !

do n't cry , bubba .

he ruined it ! that lousy do-gooder , he ruined it .

i could have it all ! holy cats ! all the oil ! all the tankers ! all the pumps ! the gosh-darn world will be out to lunch ! no heat , no gas -- sis , this is some nifty idea !

chicken feed . if gus gorman can push the right buttons -- -

small potatoes .

tomorrow the oil !

someplace where nobody knows him so they ca n't connect him with us .

blizzards ! heat waves !

hostages ?

everything on it .

lois , someday --

`` they ? ''

me too , oh , i tried to convince myself , believe me , `` it 's like being married to a doctor , '' i said . doctors are practically never at home . the get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it . then a voice said , `` could you be a doctor 's wife ? or are you too selfish . . . ``

i 'm sorry .

i know that , lois . and i wish he were here . . .

you did it . you gave it all up for me . i . . . i do n't know what to say .

your place ? maybe i should change , maybe you should , too .

let 's go to my place .

i guess it would be all right if - lois , now that you know me , i think you ought to know it all .

well , not in your mind , but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .

you do n't have anything to be sorry about . how could i . . .

oh come on , that 's ridic -

no , of course not , lois . you just get carried away sometimes . believe me , i understand --

do n't fake me out , clark . or whoever you are .

superman ? oh , was he here ?

i mean it strikes me funny that every time superman comes around , you disappear .

i do n't know , they look pretty happy to me ...

i was . . . uh . . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh , arrangements . sleeping arrangements .

but this should be exposed . they get kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get . that 's what perry says .

'magic fingers . ' fifty cents .

really ?

clark , everything i was saying -- ca n't you see i only say it because i really care ?

be my guest .

actually , yes .

i do ?

i do n't ?

one thousand ? ? that 's an awful lot of oranges . you know there are pill , lois . i 've seen them .

lois , what are you doing ?

not everyone can have x-ray vision , you know .

gee . but --

does lois know about this yet ?

that 's why they call 'em terrorists . go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --

i like trees .

look at this ! snow . ice . your idea of a good time .

you thought about me in a parka . that 's sick , lex . really .

what else is ballast for ?

it 's beautiful .

i think he said a `` curl . ''

mr. white , the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page .

but you had more than that , and i know it . you and my father -- you had each other . can i never have what you had ?

you have been given a higher form of happiness . the happiness you feel by serving others , by inspiring them to --

selfish ! but they get a chance at happiness . ca n't i have that chance ?

you no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest . surely this is not how you repay their gratitude , kal-el . could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream .

i asked the right question .

-- as the keeper of the archives of krypton , it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history .

ahhhhhh -- alpha waves .

delete in cutting

certainly . but - er . oh magnificent one , he 's just one , but you are three , or four even , if you count him twice .

the son of jor-el on this planet ?

no , jor-el , the baseball player that came from porto rico . yes jor-el your jailer .

it must be tough , having to be clark kent .

wait a minute , wait a minute , let 's talk a deal , superman . we can take a lunch on this --

too late , luthor . too late . . .

luthor , you poisonous snake . . .

perhaps there is some good in you after all , lex luthor .

put down lex luthor ?

north . keep going north !

he ran in fear from us . . .

you 'll find out , general ! and when you do . . .

who is this . . . superman ?

zod . zod .

`` super-sucker . `` for once , lex luthor was right .

did you really believe we would give up our advantage ?

sentimental idiot .

you are master of all you survey .

look , they need a machine to fly .

what shall we do now ?

and i will lead .

free !

you 'll find a good man lacy . you deserve one .

any more like you back home , clark ?

i 'm sorry to see you go .

daddy 's offered me jobs at some of his other companies . but , i 've been thinking maybe i 'll take some time off . i 'm going to find a place like smallville , in the country . maybe a farm . . . see what the slow lane is like .

gee , i 'm really sorry .

clark . . . !

oh . . . my . . .

but they 're expecting us . it would n't be polite .

i 'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we 'll have high tea . it 's very chic .

yes , i know . i 'm sure it will be a great story .

do n't worry , i 've got you .

what about here ?

this is metropolis after hours ! this is what you 'll be writing about . c'mon , let 's dance .

you 're late . very late .

i really do n't think . . .

'are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense ? '

au contraire , mon ami ! he owns all those sleazy tabloids and the daily planet !

lex , we all appreciate how you 've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we 've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent .

but superman is n't an average man .

close the curtains . the sun is hurting my eyes .

jeremy , i need you to tell the people of the world what you see .

would you mind taking a walk with me ?

i 'm sorry .

well , i do n't understand .

less sensational papers go broke . i thought i taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business .

mr. white , come with me i want to see

not so fast ! all trips are canceled . we pay for wire services . and what we do n't get from them , we 'll invent .

he was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . . oh , it 's a long story .

something . . . wonderful .

one hundred percent . and i like him that way .

you think he 'll find us .

of course ! that 's his one vulnerability . the one way he can be stopped .

hmm . . . nuclear levitation . now that 's a trick that could come in handy .

the one superman wrecked up ?

but why the hair ?

lenny , , you pathetic product of the public school system . your uncle lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . destroying superman !

nice bit . you 're good . with my brain and your , well , frankly , brawn , the possibilities are staggering . i could be . . . emperor , king ! did you see how scared those guys were ?

destroy superman !

i am an experiment ? i am freako ?

you are . . . nothing . i am father now .

but . . . but is n't the world about to be osterized ?

i 'm not going anywhere .

your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state , luthor .

look closely at his cell structure . see anything familiar ?

if you have any social skills , you 've learned them from a rattlesnake . just what are you up to ?

one of them should 've been you .

but mr. luthor , sir , i already --

thank you .

he 's thirty-five years old .

that the planet blew up on may 23 , 1937. that the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach earth . ergo ?

shut up , apple-polisher .

i take the man out of argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know ? and what does he think about ? bunkers . still living in the past , when i am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world !

i know , but --

it 's for that piece she 's doing on women and competition . she 's off to the women 's western golf classic .

lois is n't here ?

it was hot , yes .

a hot story , huh ?

you 'd better get a new alarm clock . the chief has been hollering for you .

he 's a good man , ben is . your father always said so .

i know you 're a good boy , clark . no mother could ask for better . it 's just that ...

no thanks .

is that what they 're calling him ?

superman . pretty good name for him , is n't it ?

of this ... superman .

i do n't know , lois , but i do know a fraud when i hear one . this thing goes against all natural laws .

look , there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce .

oh .

oh , not really . i guess i 'll just watch a little tv and -- -- unless ... would you be interested in dinner ?

huh ?

know what ?

oh , for god 's sake !

unbelievable .

see ? did n't i tell you this was a tough town ?

some people are n't the athletic type .

i think i lost a week 's salary at the dart board .

well , how are you enjoying your first day on the job ?

not really , no .

are there any more at home like you ?

actually , she 's silver-haired .

i know . he sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother .

what can i tell you ? he 's my leader .

look , lady , you saved my life once . i owe you a favor . but i ca n't understand why you follow a man like that .

the bald man ! the one who tried to kill me ?

what are you doing here ?

you ! the girl from the volcano ! kryptonite ...

miss teschmacher , superman is a fairly bright individual . my understanding of the way he works is that he wo n't be fooled by a simple trick .

where 's mine ? ! where 's my parachute ?

danger ? ? somebody ? ? ? lex -- where are you going ?

what if he does n't show up ? what if he 's taking a nap ?

you got wax in your ears ?

tea ?

something you can feed the pets , perhaps ? let 's have it .

but if i put my leg out like claudette clobert in --

i do n't like to talk about it , lex .

the least we can do is leave him another door jam .

what do you suggest , my dear ?

the door jam , miss teschmacher . this ethiopian shmendrick here , in his simple , unconscious way , needed something to wedge the door open , the better to inhale the flies that form such an important part of his diet . so he grabs something from the table ...

you 're not going to tell us why you 're happy , are you ?

i do n't mean to denigrate your misspent youth , lex , but what does that rock have to do with --

see ?

some people can read 'war and peace ' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story . other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe . y'know .

krypton !

when it gets to seventy-five below , stabilize it .

you 're on .

bet he makes it .

nuts . he made it .

criers and complainers ! that 's what i get ! moaners and groaners ! me , lex luthor , who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes . lex luthor , who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea , so to speak , hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above .

your father was a sick weirdo .

need i ask who 's favored to collect at the end of this week .

'and the people on the street , the little man who runs the corner newsstand , the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare . '

we do n't want a child called 'junior , ' ai n't that so , clark ? why sure it is .

guess i 'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that ... that thing he was settin ' in . what do you make of that thing ? martha ? you listening ?

all these years , happy as we 've been , how i prayed and prayed he 'd see fit to give us a child . and just when i finally accepted my bitter lot ... no one must ever know .

it 's a ... baby .

lara , please ...

it 's the only logical conclusion . if he remains here , he 'll be as dead as ...

or twenty-four as it is in earth time . furthermore , if you will reveal yourself , your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable : by hurting the people you care for . ah , this earth ... this world you live in , kal-el ... resist its temptations , its rewards , especially its political system .

twenty-four .

how good it felt !

i was going to say that there 's only one ' p ' in subpoena . what the hell did you major in at radcliffe ? middle english ? nice job on the teamster 's update , kent .

it does , huh ? clark kent , i 'd like you to meet lois lane .

well , i was born on a planet your scientists do n't know too much about . it 's in the xeno galaxy . or it was . it was called krypton . that 's k-r-y-p ...

where do you hail from ?

very much .

thirty-five .

it 's not bad .

oh . well , where do we start ?

well ... flashlight ?

superman ? ? ?

not a chance . it 's too nice a night .

who ... who ...

sort of .

cleaning a rock , otis ? jot it down . as soon as we 're back , he feeds the pets .

y'know ? i 'm sure of it . y'know ? and there 's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if i do n't do something about it . something !

please ...

and now he lies to me . he has been stealing ladies ' purses again . have n't you ? have n't you , you miserable petty crook ?

i 'll never forget you for that , mr. luthor .

otis , were you up to your old tricks ?

and garbage doors .

still , foolishly , perhaps , i had a theory that eliminates the presidential push-button . i was doing my homework ...

maybe i should get help .

sure . it 's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago . the fault line itself is unstable and always shifting , which is the reason you get earthquakes in the california area from time to time .

right , right . where was i ? ah , yes --

alison .

i ... do n't think so .

it turns to steaming piss .

other clinics ? oh sure . clinics , half-way houses , treatment centers , detox units ...

are you still in touch ?

yes ... fine .

i 'm fine . still working with my father .

yes .

no , mr. ansel . i would n't sue you .

goodnight , nicole .

goodnight , mr. ansel .

oh . right .

are you sure ?

okay .

say hello for me .

how is nicole ? is she around ?

i used to like it here . i used to care about what happened . now i think i 'll sell my house and move the fuck away .

i 'm sorry .

why ? you got money from dolores ' insurance with the school board . we all did .

that wo n't happen , billy . mitch stephens ' case is small , compared to some of those other guys . the way he told me , all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day , driving behind the bus . i know it 's a painful thing to do , but it 'll only take a few minutes of your time . that 'll be the end of it .

well , it being so depressing and all . but it 's reality . you ca n't just turn this off because you happen to think it 's a bad idea .

yes .

well i do n't .

mr. stephens says that someone did n't put a right bolt in the bus ...

good night .

i better get back .

your kids never cry .

she said she 's got to be home by nine .

he never took his eyes off his mother , even as he moved to sit beside nicole . he looked frightened .

yes .

i did .

because i 'd be to blame , right ?

what do you mean ?

a strange little fellow , but you could n't help liking him . he was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six .

for rabbits ?

i mean , the way they look . their hair and clothing ...

what do you mean by that , dolores ?

good morning , wanda . hi , hartley .

nicole !

no . from mr. stephens . that was him on the phone just now . he was calling to see how you were .

i feel like a princess .

your dad spent all his spare time in here . he wanted to make it absolutely perfect .

what happened to summer ?

that 's what he said .

should i keep reading ?

oh .

so he was mean ?

the people in the town ?

because ... he wanted to them to be punished .

well , if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why could n't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats ?

it was snowing .

why ?

i 'm absolutely positive .

the truth is that it was an accident , and no one 's to blame .

i do n't want you to lie .

it would be strange if you did n't feel that way .

note that she said 'pretty clearly ' . not 'clearly ' .

i object to that form of question . note that .

there was nothing reckless in mrs. driscoll 's behavior ?

was the bus on time ?

i object to the form of that question . note that .

no .

what do they do ?

... coming home drunk and i guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that ... and ...

will you be spending more than a night ?

is this it ?

oh god , i 'm scared .

of ... course i do . i just thought ... i could get you another

news ?

why are you calling me , zoe ?

we do .

do you have this agreement with you ?

is n't that what you want us to believe ? that we 're completely defenseless ? that you know what 's best ?

you think someone else caused the accident ?

you are angry , are n't you , mrs. otto ? that 's why i 'm here . to give your anger a voice . to be your

who did they get for that ?

the walkers spoke very highly of you .

no .

do n't know . food banks , welfare , church charity . they scrape by .

what do you remember about the accident ?

did you say anything to mrs. driscoll ?

yes .

you saw the speedometer ?

seventy-two miles an hour ? you 're sure of this ?

how fast would you say mrs. driscoll was going ? to the best of your recollection ?

you could see the speedometer ?

dolores was driving too fast .

why were you scared ?

yes , i understand .

i will offer that report . well , then , now that your memory seems to be clearing , can you tell us what else you observed at that time ?

you are ?

and according to your recollection , there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning ?

and where did you sit that morning ?

was anyone waiting for the bus with you ?

yes .

now on that morning , did there come a time , nicole , when you left your parents ' house ?

someplace where no one knows her . someplace strange and new .

it 's too late for that . she ca n't drive the bus anymore . the school board saw to that right off .

yes .

are you sleeping ?

what are you up to , nicole ?

partly . but there 's a lot the insurance does n't cover . that 's one of the reasons we have a lawyer . to make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest .

what about insurance ? does n't insurance pay for these things ?

you and mom have a lawyer ?

and i had to widen a few doors . you 'll see .

pretty slick , eh ?

just the way dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals . it 's like the biggest thing in her life .

i am . really . it was awesome .

you do n't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure .

that was great .

you do n't know that .

waiter , the check . this man is trying to hold a gun to my head !

loretta ... sidney falco ...

he 's somewhere ...

yeah , having supper with the mrs. she 's over there .

do n't apologize for me , frank !

boys , this gets nobody nowhere - you 're over excited , steve and -

did she accept ?

when do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road ?

not in those exact words - you know what a temper he 's got .

you told me that your boy was washed up with susie hunsecker , did n't you ?

looka , sidney , you 're my own sister 's son , but where does that give you the right to call me a liar ?

your nephew does n't want a drink .

blessings on thee , the both ... well ... got ta run now . see you two kids later !

give me a chance --

otis was outraged when i told him van cleve was going to fire you . tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what . right , otis ?

if it were that easy , you would n't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours ...

how is dear old j.j. by the way ?

but my day with susie is n't over yet and --

and what have i done to her , besides not buy her a new fur coat lately ? sidney , you were right -- the boy 's a dilly .

susie , as always , is free to say anything she thinks . go on , dear , say exactly what 's on your mind , dear .

no punch line . maybe i was just admiring your know-how -- -yours and falco 's .

well , son , looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble ...

j.j. , steve is n't ...

susie likes to keep her girlish secrets . but in her heart of hearts i imagine , dallas , that she fancies you in an uncommon way . now , what about you , son ? not just tom-catting around ... i hope ?

a man could n't ask for a squarer shake . let me have billy van cleve ... do n't ever tell anyone , susie , how i 'm tied to your apron strings ... billy ! j.j. ! what 's this about that boy ? what boy ? where are we , lug , in a drawing room comedy ? you 're brain is warming up , sweetheart - yeah , dallas ! ... no , do n't explain your point of view , but ...

why are you trembling , dear ... ?

not being partial , are you ?

this man is not for you , harvey , and you should n't be seen with him in public . because that 's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space .

hello , harry .

susie , there 's nothing wrong with dallas ! your brother and i arranged it all . and if the leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life , forget it ! - your brother arranged that one , too ! i do n't usually give away presents ; but this is my gift to you : get out of here ! leave this man !

the man in jail is always for freedom .

what are you so chipper about ? if i put a cross on every one of your mistakes , you 'd look like a graveyard !

wild ? take a look at them and see who 's wild ...

let 's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks -- - i 'll just lay it on the line ! what about that big rumpus in my office today ? you were there , frank ! where , according to st. dallas , j.j. was responsible for the elwell smear !

full of beans , ai n't you ? but you know that you 'll stand or fall by what you 're doing now ...

what does that mean - integrity ?

sure , he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz !

but it 's too late . i got him back the job ...

ca n't hurt ...

no , i wo n't ...

j.j. , you said you want to help me - prove it !

well , what have i got ? alimony to a pair of tramps ? they 're of no concern to me . it 's you who count , but do n't get me wrong - i do n't intend to let you break your neck again !

then maybe you can tell me if he 's as solid as you say , why does he rap me every chance he gets ?

tonight . before you go to bed . the cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river .

what you promised - do it ! do n't finagle around . it 's later than you think .

correct me if i 'm wrong , but i do n't think so ...

frankly , j.j. , i do n't think you got the cards to blitz me .

why not break it up yourself ? you could do it in two minutes flat .

match me , sidney ...

everyone knows manny davis ... ... except mrs. manny davis .

yeah ... and another thing - he 's gon na say you 'resisted arrest ' ... you know j.j ... . !

he goes out with girls .

and he 's a perfect stranger to me .

yeah !

that 's what i 'm thinking , rita . maybe ...

... cigarette girls ... and naturally -

he was writing a special sunday piece on ... ?

do n't tell me you started a polka with leo bartha ?

stay down town tonight . maybe we 'll take in a show , etc .

i swear , sidney , i ca n't help it - sometimes i wonder what i see in you ...

i know you do , sidney .

nothing ...

take a top coat .

sid ... you got me so ... i do n't know what ...

sidney , please , dear , if you feel nervous ...

you mean you do n't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world ? ? ?

may i rent you out as an adding machine .

but ...

no , an arm , he said . i told him you were sure the item would be in mr. hunsecker 's column in tomorrow 's ...

that 's the third time he 's called today .

well , i 'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing , will ya ? how do you like it ? he comes to my office and -

according to you , yeah . dallas , your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty ! i do n't like you , comma , but neither do i go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the reds . also , since we 're talking repulsive , j.j. wo n't like this for two cents ! do n't give me that look , dallas - j.j. believes in fair play . and secondly , this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend !

and it would cost a pretty penny , huh ?

good ! we 're all off to utica , so excuse me , mr. frannis-on-the- portisan .

- and i just had to drop by and tell you how great i thought you were .

did you now ? on which bounce ?

you watch him , al , i s ... s ... stutter !

... but you did it for greed , sidney - and that 's pathetic .

what ship ?

and i 'm sorry for you , too , sidney . you 're going down with the ship .

why should he put on an act ? your brother has told presidents where to go and what to do !

chickie , i 'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you ... !

he 's intuitive - he knows he 's getting fired !

jimmy ! this is a coincidence . i am just going -

susie , i was there for our sake , too . but what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa ! by the way , i think your brother was completely responsible for the smears ...

i just did n't think that i could antagonize him , steve -- for our sake , i mean .

but you did n't do much about it , susie . you walked out , and there i was ... solo ... and not too good at that .

no one 's ever stood up to my brother the way you did .

steve , stop it please ...

i get the feeling , falco , that you 're always snooping around ...

i made you write a beautiful song ...

steve , dear , please forget all of this . what can it matter after tomorrow ?

but he could be reporting back to your brother , could n't he ?

his stooge , falco , is around - i saw him walk in . he 's been spying on me for weeks , susie .

steve , my brother is n't as bad as he 's painted . he is n't perfect , but -

i 'm telling him in the morning after breakfast .

why did you marry me , miles ? why did we have these two children ? you do n't need us . your heart and your mind are in here . but it does n't love you like we do .

imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake , never gets tired , never shows up to work with a hangover . meet the pilot .

i ca n't

i 'm sorry , baby . this thing is just kicking my ass . i thought we had it with this one ...

you going to work all day ?

i was scary stuff , radically advanced . it was shattered ... did n't work . but it gave us ideas , it took us in new directions ... things we would never have thought of . all this work is based on it .

those lying motherfuckers !

do you know about the chip ?

no , no no ! ! it 'll be okay . stay with us !

the t-1000 has the same files that i do . it could anticipate this move and reacquire you at dyson 's house .

this is tactically dangerous .

you will .

we 're not gon na make it , are we ? people , i mean .

no problemo .

yeah , or `` later , dickwad . '' or if someone gets upset you say `` chill out . '' like that . or you can do combinations .

i sense injuries . the data could be called pain .

everything .

why ?

of course . i 'm a terminator .

you have to do what i say ? !

oww ! why 'd you do that ?

yeah , well fuck you , she 's a priority to me !

i need a minute here , okay ? you 're telling me it can imitate anything it touches ?

max .

what does that mean ?

yeah ? who sent you ?

my mission is to protect you .

yeah , she 's a total loser . c'mon , let 's check out the 7-eleven , whatya say ?

shoot ! ! ! !

john , get out of the way ! !

yeah . right . how were you supposed to know ? fucking men ... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your ... fucking ideas and your weapons . did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man ? colt , browning , smith , thompson , kalashnikov ... all men . men built the hydrogen bomb , not women ... men like you thought it up . you 're so creative . you do n't know what it 's like to really create something ... to create a life . to feel it growing inside you . all you know how to create is death ... you fucking bastards .

i love you , john . i always have .

i do n't trust it ! these things are hard to kill , john , believe me , i know . we may never have this opportunity again .

but it 's the only proof we have to the future ... about the war and all that .

it , john . not him . it .

out of the way , john !

kyle , do n't go !

they took him from me .

you 're already dead , silberman . everybody here dies . you know i believe that . so do n't fuck with me !

you said i could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if i showed improvement in six months . well , it 's been six months , and i was looking forward to seeing my son .

it 's finally over .

can you get us in there , past security ?

son of a bitch , i knew it !

the cpu from the first terminator .

in a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor .

my cpu is a neural-net processor ... a learning computer . but skynet presets the switch to `` read-only '' when we are sent out alone .

can it be destroyed ?

ballistic penetration shocks it , but only for a few seconds .

i 'm sure it feels very real to you --

... it 's ... like a giant strobe light , burning right through my eyes ... but somehow i can still see . look , you know the dream 's the same every night , why do i have to --

i do n't know . but you and i already know that he has saved lives .

when he met hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him , was he pleased ?

and talking is talking ! well , i think we better get on .

what is it with you , david ? where are your feelings ? where 's your hatred , your disgust ? where 's your fucking outrage , david ?

david , i do n't understand a thing about you . you 're a jew . are you a jew ?

can i ask you a favour , major ?

major , i do n't see how this line of questioning could ...

yes , david ?

yes . what was the orchestra 's reaction when they asked you to play for hitler 's birthday ?

david , need to ask you something . you heard this rumour the british found something called the hinkel archive ?

they 're trying to sort out some of the works of art the nazis stole from occupied territories . who really owns what ? that 's colonel dymshitz , on the far side .

was born here , in leipzig . i escaped in '36 . my parents , they sent me to my uncle in philadelphia . they were to follow . but they delayed and ...

you call me sir again and i 'll make you listen to beethoven .

then you 're going to kill me .

i have a duty .

let furtwngler go . please .

this is what i 'm saying . he must have had party contacts .

in a dictatorship , art belongs to the party . if you want to be a conductor , you have to have an orchestra . and you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power . all over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises .

do n't talk about things you know nothing about . he was in a dictatorship !

i was in vienna . i had with me an austrian chauffeur , max his name was , he spent time in the camps . we were looking at these viennese cleaning up the bomb damage , scavenging for rotting food , butt ends , anything . i said , 'to think a million of these people came out to welcome adolf on the day he entered the city , a million of 'em , and now look at 'em . ' and max said , 'oh , not these people , major . these people were all at home hiding jews in their attics . ' you get the point , colonel ? the point is they 're all full of shit .

so , major , tell me , have you questioned dr. furtwngler ?

i ca n't do this . it 's not right .

i 'm sorry but i have to leave . i 'll find other work . you 'll have to get someone else , that 's all .

bruckner 's seventh , major .

no . ours was damaged .

look around you . see the country you served . look at people who had real courage , who took risks , who risked their lives . like emmi 's father .

i love my country , i believe in music , what was i to do ?

who 's conducting ?

okay , so what is it ?

speaking to party members i used their language , of course i did , everyone did .

okay , wilhelm , go home now . go home and think about these past twelve years .

but you see what i 'm getting at ? you get a gorgeous house , you 're highly paid . what are you gon na do , stay or leave ? one voice comes back at me : stay !

stop this , please , stop this now !

i have illegitimate children .

well , i 'm just beginning to develop my theme . is n't that what you call it in classical music , developing your theme ? okay , so they played on your insecurity . that 's human , understandable . but , there is one guy who does n't like little k as much as he likes you - yeah , the number one man your old pal , adolf . he thinks you 're the greatest , and when he says , i want wilhelm for my birthday , boy , they better go out get wilhelm . so , josef calls and threatens you with little k. and you said to hell with the ninth in vienna , i 'll give it to adolf as a birthday present in berlin . that 's the trick they played , they got you by the balls and they squeezed . hard . why did you stay ? why did you play for them ? why were you the flag-carrier for their regime ? jealousy ?

i 'll tell you why . you remember we talked about you playing for hitler 's birthday ? and you told me that goebbels got to your doctors first , that you were tricked ?

i have no idea .

he said , 'do n't mind him . his job is to criticise , your job is to conduct . '

is n't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy , von karajan , called him a goddamn miracle , said he was a better conductor than you , then you had von der null conscripted into the army and no one 's heard from him since ?

yes , i know who he is .

yes , von der null .

you know something ? you should 've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than double indemnity . what do you imagine people thought ? the berlin philharmonic 's taken over by doctor goebbels and his propaganda ministry but wilhelm is a freelance , so art and politics are now entirely separate ? is that what you believed ordinary people thought ?

i believe art and politics should be separate , but that they were n't kept separate i learned to my cost .

gee , that 's a thing of beauty , honest to god , a real thing of beauty . i 'm going to try to remember that . liberty , humanity and justice . beautiful . but you used the word 'naive ' . are you now saying you think you were wrong ? that art and politics ca n't be separated ?

and what was that ?

it is now nine o'clock precisely . i do not intend to be kept waiting again .

i 've had enough of this , i 'm leaving .

it would be truer to say , i think , that a lot of people in high places knew me .

why were they going to arrest you ?

then why is it , please , that another conductor who was actually a member of the party , who used to play the horst wessel before his concerts , has already been cleared and is working again while i have to wait and wait and wait ?

when will my case be heard by the tribunal ?

i may have , as ... as i said , i simply do n't remember .

did you call someone you knew ?

could i have a glass of water , please ? please , fraulein ?

goebbels and goering were sure heaping honours on you . one makes you a privy councillor , the other makes you vice-president of the chamber of music , and you were n't even a member of the party , how do you explain that ?

that is correct .

what they do in austria does n't interest me one little bit . okay ? i have your questionnaire here , gustav heinrich ernst martin wilhelm furtwngler , born berlin , january 1886. orchestral conductor . and you say here you were never a member of the nazi party .

i have already been cleared by a denazification tribunal in austria .

his private life ?

and ask him about his private life .

the miracle kid .

who 's he ?

there 's a rumour ... i do n't know if it 's true or not ... but ask him about von der null .

yeah ?

i 've remembered something else ...

major , we 're discussing a man of genius , i do n't want ...

one-zero-four-nine-three-three- one . or d'you mind if i just call you 'one ' ?

so . you wanted to see me .

great catch , kid . the boy runs off .

how could i know what 's in the archive ?

i hear the british have his ... his archive , files , records .

do i know hans hinkel ?

good , and according to your questionnaire , helmuth , you never joined the nazi party .

i do n't know what you mean , major .

was looking at furtwngler like that ?

yes .

you ever seen adolf hitler 's eyes when he was making a speech ? i 've seen 'em on films .

you were in insurance before the war .

he 's as big as toscanini , maybe even bigger . in this neck of the woods , he 's probably bob hope and betty grable rolled into one .

sure .

i wo n't let the fat kid down .

the pay 's the same but you 'll make more in tips .

are n't i worth waiting for ?

you ca n't to that ...

any one of them 's ideal for home defense . which 'll it be ?

you know your weapons , buddy .

just what you see , pal .

great .

what do you think ?

that guy 's a jerk . i did you a favor .

compared to me she is . how come you 're not at the cash anymore ? they catch ya steal- ing ?

aha ! is she young ?

you must have a girlfriend .

what 's it to ya ?

what are you doing ?

i do n't think i like this .

what are you doing ?

and so you feel nothing .

no . i 'm not .

my whole life has been combat .

i was thinking , there 's so much i 've got to show you when we get through this . it 's mind boggling , the pos- sibilities ... disneyland , the beach , movies ... matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs ...

kyle ?

did n't you say that they 're going to develop this revolutionary new thing ...

about where you 're from .

about what ?

and anyway , what do i know about guerrilla warfare ?

ow ! no , it 's okay . it 's better tight .

i 'm sure .

well , at least i know what to name him . i do n't suppose you 'd know who the father is ? so i do n't tell him to get lost when i meet him .

just talk . tell me about my son . is he tall ?

white light . pain . like being ripped inside out ... slowly . like being born , maybe .

kyle .

you cold ?

hunter killers . patrol machines . build in automated factories . most of us were rounded up , put in camps ... for orderly disposal .

just let me go .

hey , i 'm not stupid , y'know . they ca n't build anything like that yet .

i 'm afraid that 's not up to me .

i did n't build the fucking thing .

you go naked . something about the field generated by a living organism . nothing dead will go .

skynet . a computer defense system built for sac-norad by cyber dynamics . a modified series 4800 .

so . you 're a soldier . fighting for whom ?

okay .

yes , but i do n't want to leave . i think this guy 's following me .

that silberman just crack me up . he had this guy in here last week who set his afghan on fire . screwed it first , then set it on --

i hate the press cases . especially the weird press cases . where you going ?

i can hear it now , it 's gon na be the goddamned 'phone book killer ' .

same shit .

call her again .

i just called .

call her .

here 's her driver 's license .

six shots at less than ten feet . weapon was a large caliber --

are you finished ?

i could fight you on this .

it is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father . or , did you think this , between us , was friendship ? just because you went fishing with my father , i should sit on my hands while you throw my money away ?

your father was a friend . goddamn it ... i watched you grow up . how do you end up treating me like this ?

what ?

it probably will . in fact , i 'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will , in time . why should i settle for that ?

but , the expectation was ten . and , in this case , expectation is everything .

you promised you 'd meet projections , alan . a dollar sixty per share you said . so , i do n't think this is so surprising a visit .

you want to know what it is ? what it 's all about ? john . chapter nine . verse twenty-five .

i only mention it because i took the test this afternoon , down on montgomery street .

i 'll be right with you .

i apologized , i offered to help .

boyfriend ?

yes .

no !

i have to show you ...

do n't move , you bitch ... !

open that door , you 'll see . your brother 's there ... conrad . he 's there . it 's your birthday party ...

it is . it 's what you hired us for . nobody touched your money . nobody stole anything . they 're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne ... all your friends ... it 's a celebration ...

that 's not true ...

stop talking to them !

he 's got a gun . everyone , he 's got a < u > real < /u > gun up here ! real situation ! ... damn it ...

just ... wait . just wait ! okay ... please , i 'm not kidding anymore ...

it 's mine ...

where 'd you get that ... ?

it was n't you . it was n't personal ...

how deluded can you be ? there 's no < u > why < /u > ...

what ... what do you mean ?

what do we do ?

i do n't know . a lot .

scams , con games . how many ?

what ?

all i mean is ... someone like you ...

it was n't his fault . he thought it was his only way back . they fleeced him real good .

no cops . i 've got a warrant out . mail fraud . they 'll take me in , but you wo n't be able to prove anything else .

you do n't have a choice . no one else is going to tell you what 's going on .

what 's wrong ?

i thought ...

they said five hundred . i said six . they said the man in the gray flannel suit . i think i said , you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit ?

give me an address so i can send your shirt back .

do n't . it was a shitty job anyway . i overreacted .

nice .

we hang down here and drop . the garbage 'll break our fall .

nicholas van orton ? what are you , a czar ?

nicholas . nicholas van orton .

that one did .

you 're the one who started running .

do n't panic . when security gets here , we simply explain what happened ...

long story . i found this key in the mouth of a wooden harlequin .

it was a gift ... from my brother .

home .

there 's got to be a flashlight .

you mean , the guy who turned blue and < u > wet < /u > himself ... ?

the lights went out , one hundred people all ran away ...

you 've got to be kidding .

do n't just stand there , get help !

excuse me , i need to explain ...

i said i was sorry ...

did she ?

yeah , yeah . she called a cab . said something about catching a plane .

split it ?

yeah .

baby , they were all over the house with metal detectors . they switched your gun with a look-alike , rigged barrel , loaded with blanks . pop-gun .

you know ... how 'd you manage the gun ? i mean ...

stop this . it 's not true ...

really ?

the phone 's dead .

we 're going to figure this out . get a grip on yourself .

they fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you . and then , just when you think it 's done , that 's when the < u > real < /u > fucking begins .

you dodged a bullet .

c.r.s . who do you think ? jesus h. , thank your lucky charms . to think what i almost got you into .

what are you doing ?

what 's this all about , connie ?

just drive , man . it 's fucking nuts !

okay , okay ... okay ? i just ... you know i hate surprises .

do it for you .

i 'm going to call .

it does n't matter ...

are you still on mediction ?

will you ?

okay .

call them . trust me .

this is n't an escort service ?

really ?

never better .

so do you . and to think i was worried ...

they 'll be wanting it back .

happy birthday , man .

and , they did n't take that watch ?

i do n't speak spanish . all i need is to get back ... just enough for that .

robbed ?

it always is .

you 're going ? well , thanks again . good to see you , rachel ... thanks for coming , mel . i 'll get your car back . right now it 's , uh ... at the zoo . sorry .

i hope .

it 's just a t.v . he 's just an actor .

i know , look at me , well ... what happened ? i do n't know . i do n't even really know . i have some things to try to take care of ... i need the car a little while .

i need your car , elizabeth .

guess !

shut up . cuff him to the rail .

you do n't need me ...

tell them the cops are after you ... tell them you 've got to talk to someone , i 'm threatening to blow the whistle .

they own the whole building . they just move from floor to floor .

goddamnit , why do they do that ?

nobody knows , pal . nobody gets the big picture ... jason , tommy , cut it out !

hey , everyone -- snack time ! here ... here you go ...

cursory examination . turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing . you 'll be out of here in no time .

may i make two suggestions ... ?

is n't this what you like ? they told me you had a thing for boats .

i 've been so lonely .

they were my husband 's . my late husband ... may he rest in peace .

is there a room key ?

the key ?

goodnight . where was she ?

goodnight then .

dinner 's in the oven .

where 's my brother ?

it 's a private matter , for you ... i think you 'll be more comfortable ...

a mister ... seymour butts .

i 'll send your regrets . honestly , why must i even bother ?

let me think ... hordes of men in tuxedos . everyone 's droning . ludwell 's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick ...

the hinchberger wedding .

friend ... why do n't you back off .

attempted murder .

he has n't called back .

you 're joking .

christ ... i ca n't believe it ... invisible ink ?

sounds like they make tennis rackets . what do we know ?

follow me .

what 's happened ...

i checked it personally .

nothing . nothing at all .

greetings fellow sheep counter .

hi . i 'm todd aubochon .

welcome home eleanor . welcome home ? i 've never been here . who did this ?

come on . these are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist .

watts . those were his keys nell found . his roommate called and said watts left when he was supposed to . i think he 's here .

and those are luke 's and mine .

do you need me anymore ? cause i 'm going to bed . they can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want , but i got ta try to get some sleep .

yeah .

nell !

nell --

maybe someday .

all night ?

the whole thing feels like experimental misdirection . like he says it 's about one thing , a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia ... and that 'd be a legitimate study , but i think that we 've been subjected to an academic bait and switch ; he 's really looking at something else .

so could you ! is this some fucked up idea of art , putting someone else 's name to a painting ?

he said that hugh crain ... hugh crain was a monster . he said that he was a brutal , horrible man . he told me that crain drove his workers to early deaths . crain had children chained to the looms in his mill . and listen to this : his beautiful rene killed herself .

the rest of you may hate your insomnia , but i find it the best time of the day for me . i 'm alone . nobody 's talking to me but myself . my mind is racing with ideas , and i can think .

no .

does she know that 's why you 're using her ?

no , but she does , and that 's all that matters .

you do n't believe in the paranormal .

and after she was thrown out , she needed a job .

are you working with her ?

no , malcolm ! individual performance is only part of it . i know why baseball players choke for no reason , i know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert , and need to , to give a great performance , but what i want to know is , how fear works in a group ...

malcolm , this is essential work i 'm doing . just think what my research can do for education . elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports , where loud noise is random ; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read .

come on malcolm , it 's only seven ohms , it 's nothing , it 's like a joy buzzer ! and it 's not about the pain , it 's about the interference with concentration ...

it 's still an electric shock !

no --

nell , the first time i ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here .

because that 's where he burned them up , the child laborers from his mills ! because that 's where their bones are ! he killed < i > hundreds < /i > . he took them here and he killed them . their bones are in the fireplace !

i do n't know .

it was a stupid thing to do .

no you 're not . something moved you . you saw something .

i got more scared .

yes .

sorry .

there were no children . rene died , and < u > then < /u > hugh crain built all of this , and then he died . his heart was broken .

what 's this ? what 's this ... this picture ?

i 'm not going back to new york city . i 'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden , where you can just see the ocean and at night , when the wind comes in just right , you can hear the sound of the harbor . what about you ?

get a blanket !

have either of you seen david watts ?

she was unhappy .

rene crain . up there . rope . ship 's hawser . hard to tie . do n't know how she got it .

who ?

is there something about the house ?

that 's a good question . what is it about fences ? sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable . why would that be ?

me ? no . what are you doing here ?

no one could . no one lives any nearer than town .

why would we --

well , i 've never lived with beauty . you must love working here .

i 've seen 'em . lot to dust .

they 're so beautiful . are n't they ?

just had to be sure .

i do n't think i want any .

-- but the painting !

because i do n't want to ruin things . because home is where the heart is .

-- what do you think ?

okay .

i do n't know , you know ...

i 'll take that as a compliment . in the city , what kind of place do you live in ?

me too . although i learned one thing about you , that you do n't know about yourself . you can be a pretty decent bitch .

red . what else ?

why ?

theo ... did you ?

david .

how could he have left without his keys ?

you know it was n't a joke , theo .

i 'm between jobs right now . my last job ... it ... the person i was working for ... the job ended . over . so ... and you ?

i do n't know what you mean .

it 's all i could afford .

this ? it 's from a thrift shop .

what 's the matter ?

i like the colors .

i do n't like do-it-yourself cuisine . buffets . salad bars .

like you .

it 's not a knock .

is that a problem ?

that 's why i 'm letting you take care of this . i 'm the one with appearances to maintain . but who gives a shit about you ? not even god .

fuck you , mr. whatever-your-name is . this is a lifestyle i embrace .

see , a successful man like me has limitations -- i lose touch at a street level . so i have to depend on a smart boy like you who 's closer to the nitty and the gritty than i am .

i 'll point you in the right direction , but you 'll have to take it to the end- zone . he 's a hit-and-run gunman -- i figure he 's not cruising the polo lounge .

what shit is this . i just do it . i do n't prepare it .

there 's already gon na be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons .

where do < u > you < /u > think he is , mike .

what the papers used to call a `` gangland slaying . ''

there 's been some trouble downtown .

i would n't talk .

yeah ?

man knows what he likes .

you think a fuckin ' guy like that ever will ? what more do you want , man ?

one thing i need .

well , that 's what we 're doin ' , n ' it .

i thought you just wanted to check out the house , man .

valets , eh ? are n't we all la-de-da .

what ?

he 's brought in the heavy mob .

no . not at all . do we ?

travelling on a dodgy passport , n ' all .

sod that . got ta get back before my probation officer wonders where i 've skived off to .

are you a resident of california ? you gon na fill out forms , man ? do the background check ? go through a three-day waiting period ?

what do i do , then , look in the bleedin ' yellow pages ?

nick 's a nick , n ' it ? no matter what state you 're in . state of remorse , most likely -- for gettin ' caught .

those streets up in the hills , man . got ta be real careful , keep your eye on the ball . two o'clock in the morning , it 's dark , your mind is all agitated , you 're drivin ' a little too fast ... those curves do n't kid around .

what more is there .

no , but between the lines , eh ? mysterious circumstances , and that .

edward rama ?

i thought maybe you just came for the ride .

did n't get it .

i was gon na be in that michael mann movie , you know -- with pacino and deniro . got three callbacks .

uh-huh .

same .

up the coast .

where 's big sur ?

she never would have turned you in , not in a million years .

dropped dead in the stalls in the odeon , muswell hill . watching doris day .

i 've 'ardly ever left it .

it 's true . has to be said . i got off to a slow start .

who remembers .

hey ?

you mean if they 'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess .

a jeweller 's up the west end . we tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road . filthy work . trouble was , the bloody thing collapsed -- < u > after < /u > we 'd made the grab , ' n all . would you adam n ' eve it .

still , there have been rewards . it 's sunny . and some of the producers who call even have credits .

it 's too involved ; a lifetime of non- involvement . anywhere else i 'd be an interesting little number , here i 'm just sag number forty-eight thousand and one . sag meaning screen actor 's guild .

these more highlights from the zagat prison guide ?

and how did you get it ?

she told you all about my details but not about his . lovely .

jenny was supposed to come to my place that night . she called me , asked if she could come over . she and terry had been -- having some trouble . lately . i do n't know about what . on this occasion , it reached some sort of crisis point .

terry 's never going to give you satisfaction . not the type .

what 'd you want me to do . stay at home , twiddlin ' me thumbs . doing sweet f.a . [ fuck all ] .

you fuckin ' guys and your dicks .

so what 's the deal . you and terry valentine at twenty paces . is that what this is about .

this and that . y'know . ways and means .

i thought you said you never did an honest day 's work in your life .

lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing . like me -- but on a grander scale of failure .

something like that , yeah .

nah , we split up when jenny was six . her second husband done a runner after she got sick . they give me compassionate leave from parkhurst to go visit her in hospital . we were always mates , me and jenny 's mum . i like to think they 're together again now . y'know . heavenly choir .

were you still married at the time -- to jenny 's mother , i mean ?

well , do n't suppose she did , really , most of her life . on her own after her mum died . aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned .

when did you get in ?

you were n't disappointed in her , then .

yeah , well , she started all that in london .

disappointed .

ashamed .

oh , it just ended , then .

if it played in england somebody owes me money . who told you that -- eddie ?

try calling me again .

it 's been a while .

not her brand .

you look alike .

and that is ?

because that was n't anything to do with me . and suspicion has been cast in my direction . did n't make any sense . choosing those shitheads over me , cutting me out of the deal , then screwing them over too .

so what 's your beef , pal ?

good job your lot showed up when they did or it would 've been < u > me < /u > for the high jump .

he 's always been very forward-thinking . he invested wisely .

so you would n't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money .

yeah . cheers , mate .

ian ?

yeah .

but first i got ta give these lads a talking to , these geezers what sent me up the river , in a manner of speaking .

sounds like you need a rest .

i had to , did n't i. nothing else for it . then just when i 'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop , i had to bugger off to the states .

but you stuck it out , anyway , all that time .

out on a oil rig . in the north sea . nine years .

yeah . another little matter needs attending to soon as i return .

while they 're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in .

i do n't know who that english guy is . some kind of -- -- courier or something . maybe a seller . maybe a buyer . but mr. < u > avery < /u > wanted him , those jigs wanted him -- and i betcha there 's a briefcase somewhere .

i do n't get it .

like he 'd never hire me for real . not week-to-week . i do n't have the credentials . he thinks i 'm just a sociopath , someone he can turn to when he needs `` plausible denial . ''

you do ?

something 's on .

straight rotation , no shit , call your shot .

what d'you mean , any happier ?

and i said so what . you think she 's any happier ?

i dunno . i just said she 's nice lookin ' .

ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores ? wow .

i got half .

yeah . i know her , all right . she came down here once , stirred up a shitstorm . we lost a full day 's work , took me weeks to get back on schedule . if she had n't a ' been terry 's woman i would 've broke her jaw . 'course , she 's nobody 's problem now .

you walked . what the hell are you doing here .

go now .

no trouble .

what kind of trouble are you in ?

< u > why < /u > then . why did you do it !

ah .

emi in london . i work with ian .

at night , there were lights -- we both saw them . we never told anyone , outside of our official report .

yes ?

please , mr crane , it 's ok , please --

but it does n't matter . really , i 'm not interested in playing music professionally .

but more or less .

well , sure , i guess . pop says so too . i work pretty hard at school .

we 've certainly missed you .

yeah .

we have n't seen you since ... i 'm terribly sorry .

beethoven . he created it , and yet he never actually heard it . i suppose he heard it all in his head , somehow .

it 's ok , i guess . no , i do n't really . i 'm not big on music , ordinarily .

then you listen to me , for i am expert . that girl , she give me a headache . she can not play . nice girl . very clever hands . nice girl . someday , i think , maybe , she make a very good typist .

did she make mistakes ?

i speak to you on ze phone , non ? you have a special interest in music ?

no . uh ... family friend .

... you are ze fahzer ?

ok .

all right .

*screw* you -- jesus ! take it to a lawyer ! no , i insist ! this is *dry* cleaning , this is not some fly-by- night thing here ! i must say , i 've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and i 've never --

... yeah , that 's it . as per our discussion .

pretty straightforward , but i do n't know if you wan na show this stuff to a lawyer --

... usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft . but cash -- that 's fine -- it 's all the same in the end -- dough 's dough , huh ?

well , i 'll be damned . the barber ! and i thought this trip was a bust . well ...

no . i -- tell me --

... ed crane . remember ? today ?

huh .

uh --

i 'm at nirdlinger 's . let yourself in .

but it 's ...

that 's my capitalization on the annex ! *my* operation , ed ! christ almighty . that 's what i was just talking to doris about , a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from ann .

... why do n't you just pay him , dave ?

$ 10,000 ! i do n't know what to do , ed . i do n't know what i *can* do . even though i know who the sonofabitch is .

specialty store down in sacramento .

... say , where do you get those things anyway ?

ok. take your coat , ann ?

how ya doin ' , ed ?

my wife and i had not ... performed the sex act in many years .

just coffee .

i knew we 'd pay for it .

should i ... should i tell you why ?

i know all about that . but i do n't know how much to tell them .

you do n't have to --

how are you ?

honey ...

ahh ...

yeah , right .

where you going ?

honey ?

who ? *who ? ! * i do n't know who ! but the point is that if mr prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he 's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe 's past , then we might *know* who ! but we ca n't *know* what really happened ! because of fritz , or werner , or whatever the hell his name is ! and because me prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it 's easier to victimize your wife ! because it 's easier *not* to look ! because the more you look , the less you know ! but the beauty of it is , we do n't * got ta * know ! we just got ta show that , goddamnit , *they* do n't know . reasonable doubt . science . the atom . *you* explain it to me . go ahead . try .

will anyone say they saw you there ? on your way there ? in there ? on your was back ?

i took doris 's keys .

how did you get into the store ?

birdy 's in the parlor -- i 'm on long distance here .

well , the best , the money-is-no-object best , for a criminal case , any lawyer would tell you freddy riedenschneider . out of sacramento . 'course , i do n't know how you 're fixed for money .

so --

he a good man ?

yeah . what do i , uh ...

ok. boy . jesus !

i 'm fine .

no thanks .

yeah .

oh , no . that was written by mr ludwig van beethoven .

they too use the toilet , ed . in spite of appearances . and their money will be secured by the barbershop . a rock . a *rock* , the barbershop . i mean , how long has *this* place been here ?

i 'm gon na mingle it with common house dirt .

frank .

yeah , yeah -- go home .

uh-huh .

... so you tie your own flies , ed . i mean , if you 're really serious . you tie your own flies , you do a -- i know it 's matickless , i know , people say , hey , you can buy flies at the store -- but you can buy your fish at the store , ed , you see what i 'm saying ?

now , being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk ; there 's not much to it once you 've learned the basic moves . for the kids there 's the butch , or the heinie ...

russians exploded an a-bomb .

... ed ?

uh-huh .

birdy ...

... i 'm crane .

you also have an interest in the securing property ?

we 're just closing , friend .

you 'll go to the prison hospital .

homicide .

yeah , uh , they brung her to the county jail , uh ...

... look , pal , it 's a tough break , but , uh ... well damnit , your wife 's been pinched .

manual overrides are n't working . i 'm getting nothing , lieutenant .

no one broke into this room , sir . someone broke out . that lock was torn off from the < u > inside < /u > .

why not ?

anything missin ' ?

i 'm sorry , sir . you okay ?

pendergast may be in trouble . do n't you understand ? he still has n't come back . it 's been over three hours --

oh jesus ...

just a minute . i 'm shaking ! take the gun .

let 's go !

where 's the walk-in safe ?

it 's a little late , you son of a bitch . there 's a friggin ' monster loose in here ! get the fbi , the fire department . find metal cutters , cut through . and bring a cannon . the damn thing is huge .

like hell !

in every exhibition room . the museum 's divided into five cells . the reception and exhibit are in cell five . we could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four , then seal the perimeter with our fire doors .

it 's fool proof , basically . i designed this whole thing myself . every valuable object in the museum carries a small electronic chip . if anything 's moved so much as an inch , we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft .

go out the north exit ! there 's a hallway and a false wall by the greek vases . run !

how big is the sub-basement ?

i do n't like animals . never have . dog bit me when i was little . after that i gave up on pets . animals are irrational . give me a psychotic killer any day . if there 's one thing that makes me queasy it 's being part of a food chain . my first case as a rookie , two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo . it was late august . over ninety . the polar bear was inside his cave . kids did n't know he was in there . all they saw was the pool . they got to swimming and splashing . the noise woke up the bear . by the time i arrived , both little boys were in pieces . the bear was dragging one kid around by the foot . i can still hear the mother screaming --

correct .

you think what we 've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells ... like hamburger ?

unfortunately , no .

no . there 's more . there were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat .

yes . that 's my case . now it 's yours . all the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way . decapitated . brains extracted . limbs torn to shreds . it looked like the work of a large animal , but there was no sign of an animal on board .

call me vince .

lieutenant --

an original roger tory peterson of a red-breasted merganser . amazing . i have a copy of this in my office at home .

whose footprints ?

careful . that mess on the ground is brains .

the body ?

vince d'agosta . am i out ?

should n't a drug that powerful be destroyed ?

i 'm one of the few who know every inch it , now that john is gone .

this place is a maze .

i 'd say we 're in its home .

dr. john whittlesley .

what 's that ?

it 's important . please . you have to come ! pendergast , too . she 's found out something .

what are we talking about here ?

oh yes ! who could forget . afterwards you sent me that amazing case of chateau lafitte .

we will .

come back and get me .

what 's that ?

dr. frock . did you hear that ?

i think so .

so the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night .

but a virus normally codes for other viruses . this one 's making human and animal proteins . listen to this . `` glycotetraglycine collagenoid . weinstein 's tropic hormone . 4- monoxytocin supressin hormone . ''

look at this . an ambyloid reovirus protein . that explains why the computer 's confused . the plant 's infected with a virus .

they 're eggs .

i 'm not giving up .

come on . i 'll walk you back to the elevator .

my work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you .

how can you say that ? you know it 's not true .

let me help . i can take care of everything .

that , apparently , is the problem . i 'm yesterday 's news . who needs a curator of plant biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants ? monsters and dinosaurs , cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm .

now margo , do n't overreact . cuthbert has to cut costs somehow . my leaving makes perfect sense . this is n't exactly early retirement . i 've overstayed the party a bit .

yes . bit of a shock . but as cuthbert so tactfully put it , the museum needs new blood . and since i 've been here since the mesozoic era --

read it out loud .

i would n't be so sure .

do you mean dr. whittlesley ?

fourth floor , west wing , but stay with your class .

way cool . then you know where the dinosaurs are .

you work here ?

they were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard 's .

and it snuffled the ground like a dog .

quiet !

keep the animal quiet .

not on the map . looks like it connects with the city sewer .

come on . let 's get back to the others . we ca n't leave them alone .

heel argo ! hobbes ! heel !

okay .

how about lunch ?

lizard dna and human dna on the same strand ? impossible . the sample must be contaminated .

for once i 'm glad you 're rumor central . what in the world is going on ?

that 's impossible .

frock 's been fired .

margo , you have n't heard ?

but at what a price .

that thing is john whittlesley . i should have seen it before ! the fibers are infected with a virus . you eat them , and the virus alters your dna ! he became addicted to them in south america , followed the plants back to the states . he probably entered the country as a man . it would have taken several months for the change to take place . that 's how he got from the boat to the museum !

no ! do n't kill him ! pendergast , you were right . it 's john !

it 's deceptively simple . like a bruckner symphony or a matisse .

that 's a ptarmigan , feigning a broken wing . the bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest !

it did n't want the fibers . what does that mean ?

no . the planetarium is in the next cell . this is one of the fire doors ...

we have the fibers . do n't you see ? the creature is hungry . it wants the hormones in these plants . it would take hundreds of human brains to supply what 's in these fibers . we 're just a poor substitute . to make it stop hunting , we have to give it what it wants .

it 's not supernatural . mbwun is an animal . part lizard , part human , a genetic freak of some kind , like the half-goat , half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of vietnam .

they 're all heavily armed .

all right . if you 're positive .

that 's not what i saw .

where did you see it ?

it 's okay , i 'm all right . i remember now ... it was an animal . something large ! i could smell it . it was hunting me . i saw two green eyes in the dark .

i do n't know . he sent back a statue that 's supposed to be an exact representation . but i 've never seen it . it 's in the exhibit .

you were afraid of him , were n't you ?

how did you know that ?

i do n't understand .

and john ?

dr. whittlesley was last seen in belem , venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared . a taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat . that boat washed up in my district . everyone on board was killed .

somehow , when all this happened ... i knew it would come back to john . is he really dead ?

an invention of mine . it 's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its dna . i call it the genetic sequence extrapolator .

special agent pendergast . fbi . forgive me . i guess i was snooping . what is this ?

that 's right .

why would n't i ?

i 'm sorry . i do n't have anything for at least a month .

i want to book a flight to fiji .

do it !

what music ?

why would we --

he has to be on foot . he has the world 's most recognizable face . he ca n't disappear .

he gave it back to his father .

what happened down there ?

no , hold back ...

close up ?

no , of course not . and since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement .

who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - `` bringing up baby '' - would turn into a `` cradle to grave '' concept . he is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation .

in competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue .

let me demonstrate some examples .

not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth , he gives us a glimpse of ourselves .

as you know ratings have never been our primary goal . i imagine we 'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing truman 's latest torment . however , i 'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal .

i have a map .

nothing was real .

they removed all physical trace of her but they could n't erase the memory .

sure she would .

you think she 'd go through with it ?

right now ? we 've got finals tomorrow .

-- i 'm not allowed to talk to you .

oh , yes .

not the whole thing , truman . you were right about one thing .

just between you and me , marlon , i 'm going away for a while .

that 's the `` big guy '' . quite a paintbrush he 's got .

i went all over but i never found a place like this . look at that sunset , truman . it 's perfect .

what exactly ?

i told you i ca n't .

i figured , what 's the point ? i knew i 'd just be taking my problems with me . once the kids came along , it made me look at seahaven with new eyes . i realized , what the hell could be better than this ? i 'm telling you . what you really need is someone to carry on the `` burbank '' name .

< i > spare room < /i > - i can start thinking about selling up ... and i 'll be gone . up and away on that big steel bird . i 'm going , do n't you worry about that .

it 's not that simple . takes money , planning . you ca n't just up and go . oh , i 'm going to do it , do n't worry about that . i 've just got to move slow . pick my moment . bonus time 's just around the corner . soon as i finish the ...

outta my job , outta seahaven , off this island ... < i > out ! < /i >

i 'm thinking of getting out , marlon .

who were you talking to ? !

do something ...

you 're having a nervous breakdown , that 's what 's happening .

what the hell has that got to do with anything ? tell me what 's happening ? !

i 've tasted other cocoas . this is the best .

i 've got my seahaven bankcard .

truman , what about that sign ?

because i never have . that 's why you go places , is n't it ?

you hate gambling .

where shall we go ? where shall we go ? spontaneity is what it 's all about . forget fiji . we ca n't very well drive to fiji , can we ? what about atlantic city ?

are you listening to a word i 'm saying ?

-- you 're a nurse , are n't you ?

oh , my god !

i still want to look over a couple of things .

i made macaroni .

i know .

i thought we were going to try for a baby . is n't that enough of an adventure ?

-- we could bum around the world for a year on that .

where have you been ?

what 's that ?

hold on a minute , dear . here 's us at mount rushmore . you remember , truman -- when dad was still with us - that was quite a drive . you slept all the way there .

-- darling --

they never found dad 's body -- maybe somehow --

i feel certain my condition runs in the family . ca n't this wait , dear ?

you know surprises are n't good for me . you should really call before you come over , dear .

how 's your hip ?

how are you , mother ?

leak at the plant . they had to shut her down .

i do n't understand .

i 'd ask for identification .

you 're not supposed to talk about it ? who told you that ?

i think that about does it , spooky .

poopy day ?

me ?

they took her --

when was that ?

what am i doing here ?

most of what i find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive . i realize you 're very lucky to be alive agent scully . the ordeal you 've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the justice department . until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation .

no , they do n't .

what is it you find incredible ?

working with ?

i hope to . we 're working to develop this evidence --

and you have conclusive evidence of this ? something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --

you 've been back to dallas ?

i apologize for making you wait -- i 've brought some new evidence with me --

of what ?

tell them he was trying to save the young boy 's life , and that he died heroically like the other firemen .

this man 's family will want to see the body laid to rest .

the developing organism is using his life energy , digesting bone and tissue . we 've just slowed the process .

how can this be ?

this man 's still alive .

brought on by what ?

kurtzweil , we think .

my lateness may have well been absence . a course has already been taken .

strughold . he 's just gotten on a plane in tunis .

is it an emergency ?

you want a call if we turn up kurtzweil ?

selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer .

you got some kind of business with him ?

we were n't expecting to find those remains , of course . they went right off to washington .

yeah , well i do n't have them all .

-- you saw this experiment ?

i 'm not sure . a virus --

negotiating with whom ?

i do n't either , but it sure sells books .

you mean that apocalyptic trash you write ? i knew your name was familiar . i just did n't know why .

that 's what i 'm saying .

s.a.c . darius michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb .

i came on my own . after reading about the bombing in dallas .

old friend of your father 's .

you follow me out here for a reason ?

do i know you ?

where are we ?

i think you 're in anaphylactic shock --

... my pulse feels thready and i 've got a funny taste in the back of my throat .

you do n't mulder -- you 've never needed me . i 've only held you back . i 've got to go .

we 're close to something here -- we 're on the verge --

what ? what 's wrong ?

run .

i hear the humming . like electricity . high voltage maybe .

for the purpose of what ?

what do you think it is ?

i 've got to be in washington d.c. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life . and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas , chasing phantom tanker trucks .

hey , i was right about the bomb , was n't i ?

what are my choices ?

and where are they going with it ?

i do n't know , mulder .

no irrigation system . somebody 's covering their tracks .

the bone was porous , as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it .

this is where he marked on the map , scully . where he says those fossils were unearthed .

something i could n't show to anyone else . not without more information . and not without causing the kind of attention i 'd just as soon avoid right now . the virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat i 've never seen before . what it did to them it did extremely fast . and unlike the aids virus or any other aggressive strain , it survives very nicely outside the body .

i was n't planning on it . particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning . but i got a better look at the blood and tissue samples i took from the firemen .

mulder --

we 're being blamed for these deaths . scully , i want to know what this man died of . do n't you ?

and there 's been no autopsy performed . there 's no y incision here ; no internal exam .

there 's some kind of cellular breakdown . it 's completely edematous .

get dressed , scully .

go home , mulder . it 's late .

what are you implying , scully ?

because they wanted me to invalidate your work , your investigations into the paranormal . but i think this goes deeper than that .

i meet with the opr day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment ...

mulder . move away from the door . we 're coming through it .

thirteen fifty nine , thirteen fifty eight , thirteen fifty seven ...

scully , i found the bomb .

something sweet .

mulder ... ?

i 've got to find scully .

are we being watched ?

i know . agent scully reported your suspicions to opr . on the basis of her report , i sent techs over to s.a.c . michaud 's apartment . they picked up pstn residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in dallas .

she was with me .

what about you ?

find agent scully . save her . only her science can save the future .

let me out . stop the car .

where is he ?

what is it ?

i think of it as an agreement . a word your father liked to use .

about the conspiracy ?

i have answers for you .

where 's scully ?

you need not kill a man to destroy him .

no one believes kurtzweil or his books . he 's a toiler . a crank .

we 've allowed this man his freedom . his books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial . has he outlived his usefulness to us ?

let me remind you who is the new race . and who is the old . what could be gained by withholding anything from them ; by pretending to ignorance ? our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable . to start colonization early .

in hope of what ? learning that it 's true ? ! that we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms ? !

this is n't colonization , it 's spontaneous repopulation . all our work ... if it 's true , then they 've been using us all along . we 've been laboring under a lie !

i 'm sorry . my grandson fell and broke his leg .

agent novak . i did n't get a chance to clear him .

what happened ?

no . no .

i 'll be fine .

he needs to be turned over .

like a new year 's day hangover .

nothing .

a pocketful of fucking rye . what 's wrong ?

i 've got to feed my cat . besides , i want to get to bed early .

henry wants me to try this vietnamese place he 's wild about . want to come ?

okay .

yes mother .

yes , but , you 're a willing participant . picture edward in a strange place , lost , frightened ...

i 've heard this argument before . it 's not happening .

he creates the obstacles , he decides which games to play .

they 're hungry .

i ca n't leave him !

come on !

like hell `` wait . ''

wait ...

tell me .

what happened to charles gish ?

maybe this is a big fucking waste of time .

evil .

then what is he ?

you think you can do this , do n't you ?

this is going to sound terrible , but ... i do n't think she matters anymore . not to him . he never finished her . the others ... he was able to make them his .

why 'd you bring him here ?

that 's what therapists are for , right ?

absolutely . i suppose everyone does .

peter , okay ?

this man is deeply disturbed , he ...

how hard could it be ... ?

really ? i do n't work with violent cases , i work with children . but even a kid lies . they love it when they get you to believe something that is n't true . do n't you think stargher would do the same ?

as far as i needed .

what now ?

i need you to find something in the basement ...

she the one from santa cruz ?

intravenous administration complete .

federal bureau of investigation , ma'am . we know all , see all ...

yes . but you 're going to sit down right now . i have to ...

no .

nervous ?

yes .

that was with edward . she 's accustomed to his world . stargher 's mind is unfamiliar territory . she 's `` lost . '' someone has to go in . remind her what 's really happening . and get her out . until then , she 's at his mercy .

catherine !

now .

now ?

but you looked so cute . all sleepy ...

next time , tell me , okay ?

what else do we do ? !

let 's give old carl a call . tell him he 's got company .

das worren nooh zeiten .

das mussen sie doch wissen . ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins hans komme fraulein schmidt , ein schande ...

... anyway ?

we 're getting you out of here , are n't we ?

that 's his headache .

oh , the usual things ...

did he say anything about me - tell me ?

i saw him today .

here , it will be cold on that train .

harry .

... is there ?

are you going , too ?

i 'll put these flowers in water .

seventy pounds a tube . he wanted me to write for his great medical charity .

he liked to laugh .

can you imagine a parrot nipping a man ?

what happened to your hand ?

i thought you were going to go away . are n't the police after you ?

i wish i knew .

what are you going to do ?

sneak out the other way , and go back to your theatre . i 'd better not see you again .

well , i did n't learn that from him .

it 's just what he used to say .

anna .

when ... what did you do ?

what 's that ?

do i ...

i can try . is it comedy , or tragedy ?

just another part i 've got to learn .

sssh . do n't . do n't , please .

who are you looking for now ?

yes . he moved his head , but the rest is good , is n't it ?

dr. winkel .

they 're forged .

anything really wrong with your papers ?

the police . they 're searching my room . sie mussen doch wissen .

i was told there were only two men there .

i do n't know . they did n't answer .

i know . i wondered about it a hundred times , if it really was an accident .

he was harry 's driver ?

dr. winkel ? who is he ?

he said he remembered me too . seems to show he was n't in much pain .

oh , american , thank you . i like them .

i 'm so sorry , i did n't notice much .

nichts danke . kein .

thank you .

i helped harry fix her papers , mr. martins ...

good evening , miss schmidt . you remember me ?

vienna is a closed city , miss schmidt , he ca n't get away .

it 's true then ?

two weeks ago .

in one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called joseph . he gave you the number of the casanova club . that is where a lot of friends of lime used to go .

no .

they 'll be returned to you , miss schmidt , as soon as they 've been examined .

must you take those letters ? calloway yes , i 'm afraid so .

i do n't want it .

must you take those ?

i 'll carry a copy of one of your books . harry gave it to me .

austrians are n't allowed in your hotel . could n't we meet at the mozart cafe ?

i was a friend of harry lime .

... austrian police headquarters .

please keep this passport to yourself , until i make some inquiries , will you , major ?

i have n't got a sensible name , calloway .

i 'll do what i can , if she 'll let me .

i was on that side , the shadow was on that side , and no turnings on either side .

which side of the road ?

fifty yards right down there .

look ... i tell you , you do n't think i 'm blind , do you ?

no .

i suppose you do n't believe me .

... be responsible for you in the streets .

i ca n't . he disappeared ...

i would like a word with this orderly harbin .

next , paine .

are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder ?

oh , stop behaving like a fool , martins .

a parrot bit me .

tactful too , are n't we , callaghan ?

i 'm not interested in whether a racketeer like lime was killed by his friends or by accident . the only important thing is that he 's dead .

going to find me the real criminal ? it sounds like one of your stories .

well , you could say that murder was part ...

ever seen one ?

no .

did you ever hear of `` the lone rider of santa fe ? ''

i 'm afraid i 've never heard of you . what 's your name again ?

once in a while .

see much of him before that ?

back in school . never so lonesome in my life till he showed up .

can you tell me whose ...

very good , sir .

it 's a military hotel .

... his number .

heard of harry lime ?

no , a major , were you really ?

it was just a soldier . i was trying to punch his major in the eye .

i do n't need a dentist . somebody hit me , that 's all .

welcome ?

very popular , sir .

have you , sergeant ? author - martins . thank you , sergeant .

what do you want ?

... this way .

what did you expect me to be - part of your ...

outside of your stories ... i 've got to be careful .

why not ?

you would n't do anything .

and - anna ...

unwise , holly ...

you can help her .

it 's good to see you , holly .

talk to me ? ... of course ... come on ...

not necessarily . she 'd probably want to help .

... you .

what did he say ?

it 's wonderful how you keep the tension .

in great pain ?

i understand ...

could he have been at all conscious ?

thank you .

dr. winkel ?

yes , it is .

you do n't mean that doctor ?

yes .

... popescu ...

mr. lime - yes .

mr. lime 's . accident ...

who ?

english ?

... mr. martins ?

a novel , mr. martins ?

what else did he tell you ?

will we never teach these austrians to be good citizens . it was his duty to give the evidence .

was n't he at the police inquiry ?

what else ?

something wrong .

not the sort of thing i should confess to a total stranger , but you have to break the rules sometimes . humanity 's duty .

okay .

passport , please .

thanks .

i 'm sorry . i ca n't lend you any money .

i 'm really sorry but i just arrived ; i 'm on a pretty tight budget myself . i just ca n't afford it .

excuse me .

why not ? thai girls best in the world . thai food best in the world . thai dope best in the world .

traveler .

she is gone !

richard - i saw a fin !

i think we 're about half way .

so how many miles do you think it is ?

yeah , ok. forget it . we wo n't tell anyone .

richard , it 's secret . that 's the whole point .

why ?

nice work .

she means your neighbor . the scotsman

richard ?

sorry . i thought i was doing quite well .

i think so too .

francoise -

i think it 's a bad idea to tell anyone .

hi .

i hope our noise did not keep you awake .

do you know the kentucky friend mouse story ? ''

where did you lose it ?

i think the whole jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on mt . moriah , and we still live in terror ... .

watch your language ... .

they had sabra and shattila .

yeah , but not on the letters .

fuck you . i hate the jews at least as much as you do .

how come you do n't know it ? how can you say you hate the jews when you do n't know anything about --

the mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters . they thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there , with secret , alternative meanings .

fire ...

then i wo n't bring you ... .

bring your friends ... . we 're not his friends .

maybe i am . maybe we 're all jews now . what 's the difference ?

you will .

i do n't care about money .

yeah , i read your piece . it 's very smart . and very wrong .

this ? this is a joke . i 'll give your group a thousand bucks .

i have a job .

you do n't own this place .

nothing . why are you doing this ? i thought god did n't exist .

shit ... did you talk to your mother today ?

lina , come here !

nazis talk about it all the time .

you should n't .

do n't curse in front of it .

fuck that .

and belief follows ?

nothing but nothingness ... judaism 's not about belief .

christianity 's silly , but at least there 's something to believe in . or not believe . judaism there 's nothing .

with you there 's a tragic dimension .

good question . both . aleph ...

you ca n't curse in front of it either .

what assholes .

see , the jews love to separate things : the holy from the profane , milk from meat , wool from linen , the sabbath from the week , the jew from the gentile ... . as if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that .

yeah , it 's stupid . put it on , or i wo n't teach you .

that 's stupid .

they think it 's the word of god , and it 's holy , and the flesh is n't ... .

i want to learn to read it .

'cause i want to know ... . what is this word ? this one here ...

do you know it like that ? by heart .

that was a later invention , it 's not in the scrolls ... . anyway , the jews know where the sentences end . they know the whole thing by heart . every word . every letter .

you ca n't .

when can i see you ?

who 's linda ?

then how come you 're talking to me ?

too many good players down here . i 'm with one right now .

yes , i am . basically i am .

you 're not like the others , are you ? ... your friends .

what 's he care about ?

he 's in a mental institution ... . he 's been there for ten years , off and on . mostly on .

how come so many of the books are in spanish ?

why no silencer ?

i just read it ... .

you 're not in school ? what do you do ?

disease ? what disease ?

i did n't notice his shoes ... . did your mother know he was there ?

i did n't realize you cared .

carla ? ... it 's me , danny ... danny balint ... ? we met at that ... [ meeting at your house . ]

shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod .

who 's eichmann ? ! ! ?

an investment banking house .

it 's a romantic movement , curtis . it always has been .

yes , of course . but that only plays in this room , with people who are n't embarrassed to call themselves nazis . if you want a modern fascism , you do n't mention jews .

i 've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil hitler . how am i supposed to --

that does n't seem to be happening , does it ?

we want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream : works like < i > the bell curve < /i > , < i > sociobiology < /i > , anti-zionism , anti- immigration , the com-munitarian issue ... . we 'll hold conferences : invite liberals , blacks , jews . chomsky , cockburn , stanley crouch , shahack ... .

a week or so . there 's something i want to do here first .

totally . the family emigrated from bulgaria when he was eleven .

it 's too late ... . if i did n't , somebody else would . yom kippur starts at sundown . will you go to synagogue ?

i do n't think you know what you are .

how do you reconcile the two ?

what were you , following me ?

to discredit me . because i know who they are . look , i thought i explained it to you . those people can say or do anything . and they will . it 's all narrative to them , it 's ... are you going to print what this guy said ?

why would nadelman lie ?

that 's what i 'm trying to find out , danny . who am i fucking with here ?

were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else ?

notice the israelis : a fundamentally secular society . they no longer need judaism because they have soil . the real jew is a wanderer , a nomad . he has no roots , no attachments . so he `` universalizes '' everything . he ca n't hammer a nail , plow a field . he can only buy and sell , invest capital , manipulate markets . he takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books , ideas , numbers . this is his strength ... . take the great jewish minds : marx , freud , einstein . what have they given us : communism , infantile sexuality and the atom bomb . in a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of europe , they 've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare , irrational urges and relativity , a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt . why ? because it is the deepest impulse of the jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread , nothing but nothingness . nothingness without end ...

of course they 're jews .

you ever fuck a jewish girl ?

no ... yeah , fine , go ahead ... so what 's this about ? is this about me ?

is it okay if i record this ?

there 's a bomb here . it 's going to go off at seven-thirty .

the truth does n't mean anything to you , does it ?

you 're telling me you killed him ? you ? killed him ? bullshit . what kind of gun did you use ?

with the shoes ... there was more than one ?

you know the joke : a jew 's shipwrecked on a desert island . when they rescue him , they see he 's built two synagogues . they say , for vhat do you need two synagogues ? he says , vun to pray in , and vun i 'd never set foot in so long as i live , so help me god . you pray in the one you 'd never set foot in ... and vice versa .

point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking .

to hear them read torah .

i always won .

i want you to say kaddish for her . it 's the only thing she asked from us ... .

what is happening ?

fine .

so what jew would you kill first ?

look , you want cheese , go someplace else .

i 've got to get back to the --

do you know them ? i made him some noodles for dinner . you can heat them up and --

they 're not my people ... .

why deprive him of his greatest pleasure ?

i just came to get some stuff . i 'll be out in five minutes . he does n't want me around .

what are you doing here ?

i 'm doing a piece on right-wing groups , post oklahoma city . i hear you 're an important figure in those circles . you have a lot of interesting ideas ... .

when do you want it to go off ?

no , it has to be tomorrow . you wo n't get this many of them in here for another year . it 'll be fine .

so what do we do with the device ?

what about drake , did he ever show up ?

what ... ?

shut up . fuck you ... .

get out of here ... .

yeah , hey , how 're you doing ...

what about you ? what are you doing ? something strange , i bet .

jts ... ?

i did n't . i told you , i ca n't --

why me ?

lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows .

okay , that 's it . you 're going back to --

just a little ... what 's the difference ?

we redesigned the timing mechanism . it ca n't possibly malfunction .

what ?

so what ?

do you have a suit ? let 's get him one ... . and a cell phone too . and if you insist on blowing up a synagogue , make it that big one on fifth avenue , would you ?

i 'm not an intellectual ... . i mean , i read , but ... fund-raising is n't what i ...

we want you to help run it . give speeches , lead seminars ... handle the fund-raising .

oh , fuck you ...

eat shit , assholes ... .

eat shit ... .

curtis is always more complicated than he seems . even now .

you 're leaving ?

i was thinking of something kinda stupid last night . you know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the gods . take leda for example , sleeping with jupiter , who came to earth as a swan ... well , can you imagine leda announcing to her swan `` you 're going to be a father , my little chick-a-dee '' ?

no .

yes .

i think , he 's really nice ... he 's a funny guy ... sometimes even very moving .

will that interfere with my getting maternity leave ? i 'm pregnant .

you 're right . you 're fired .

what 's happened ? ?

the fool was asleep ! if i were n't around , he 'd already be dead ! ! ! is that who you want to live with ?

five minutes and fifty seconds .

do n't .

... not yet .

i wo n't , i swear .

what are you doing here ?

good night enzo , good night jacques .

do n't you agree , jacques ?

listen to her ! `` that 's what he 's here for '' ! he 's here to loose , that 's what he 's here for . first of all , i 'm unbeatable . second , how old are you ?

and just where are you from ?

some people say it 's the most virile sport in the world . one has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea , all muscles contracted in one super human effort ...

it 's the free diving world championship . i am by the way world champion !

yes .

you 're going to hold me up at a time like this ?

very chic . anyway , you do n't have anything else , do you ?

enzo , what are you going to do with the money ?

noireuter .

jacques , take me back down ... please .

... it is much better down there . it 's a better place .

we ca n't dive anymore . they want to cancel the competition for a while .

i 'm concentrating .

... how long was i asleep ?

it 's never the sea ! it 's roberto , mamma , that stupid actress ... oh shit ! jacques , what do you know ?

i give you this . you 're stubborn ... dumb , but stubborn .

so what ! ? his job is to hand out the paychecks . and he does that very well , let me tell you .

no problem , i enjoy talking in my sleep .

the size of the lungs has nothing to do with it !

everything about what ?

why ?

then , it 's very chic . avanti !

no .

c'mon , you two ... jacques , we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight . we have a new world champion .

ahi , ahi , cazzo ! ma mamia ! where ... ? god , she 'll kill me ... ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant .

enzo ?

people say that ?

i 'm sorry ... i do n't know how to ask the questions .

... so , after all these years , you must have lots of questions to ask . am i right ?

what room have you got ?

that 's too easy ! every time i beat a record there 's always some dumbshit asking me : `` d'you know that french guy , mayol ? he 's supposed to be very good ! too bad he does n't compete . '' so , you 're going to come with me to taormina ! first , because you 're my friend and second , because you do n't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure . ... i 'll see you there ...

great !

you do n't mind if i go instead , do you ?

fine !

you are the father .

jacques ? i 'm pregnant .

i saw how it has to be .

you 've got to tell me what happened ?

... when you dive ... with that machine ... what does it feel like ?

you want to lie down for a while ?

what ?

uncle louis . he 's a 75 year old amazing guy , is n't he ?

why did you take me to the hotel , if you live here .

okay . in that case ... i 'm at the airport in nice .

absolutely positive .

... it 's hard you know . you 're so far away and i do n't know what else to say .

... that 's funny ... i had this job with enzo ... we got fired too .

how are you ?

it 's me ... johana .

jacques , you set a world record .

... the way she moves .

well , water is n't exactly the best thing for pictures ... not even for pictures of dolphins ...

please move slowly , you 're rocking the boat .

i 'm being a pain in the ass . it 's beautiful here .

i was doing an insurance investigation in palermo . i work for an insurance company . so , i decided to take a few days off . i do n't know this island at all . it really is gorgeous .

please , have a seat .

in the lake ?

positive , sir .

what were italians doing living in greece anyway ?

the whale ! how could i forget ? always was something fishy about that woman !

liar ! thief ! torturer ! when you were an orphan i nursed you at my breast .

in my apartment ?

where i saw the mermaids ? ! why do n't you ever ask any question ? i 'm always the one asking the question ! we 're sitting here like two stones and i 'm taking to myself . ask me something , goddamnit !

no .

you should n't dive everyday , papa .

vitamins , exercise , herb tea ... and see a doctor , will ya ?

do you think i should have stayed ? do n't you think maybe i should have stayed ? i 've been a jerk , right ? i should have stayed ! i was supposed to be in love ... i was in love ! i am in love , why did i act like a bitch ? he went swimming . all the man did was go swimming ! i must be crazy . it was too good to be true .

does that have a hidden meaning ?

... since eight o'clock last night ... ! you 're in love .

have n't you been listening ?

... and the new stereo .

they got the new t.v .

yes ... it 's magic .

what 's that little air bottle on the machine ?

they 're paramedics . they wait at 180 feet .

you 've made me a happy insurance person .

that 's the experiment ? dumping a guy into a frozen lake ?

it 's esther . santa 's got her .

take esther with you , you 'll need the backup .

looks like i got a plane to catch .

that 'll work . get them out to the jewish community stat . we got an epidemic on our hands .

hey , it 's your bar mitzvah . i 'm just readin ' the torah portion .

i got the job done did n't i ? i did what i had to do .

from the story of purim . well , now that we 're all acquainted , let 's sit down and start the sabbath .

mordechai !

oh my god . she 's become my pimp . and she 's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder .

your mother was right . you do work too hard .

what ! ?

want to get a drink ?

now we wait for santa to make his next move .

what are we going to do ? we 're at least an hour from the front .

any sign of santa ?

i 'm sorry to hear about santa . he was a good friend , but my days ...

mordechai , santa claus has been rubbed out by his son damian . the man 's a demon . there 's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho santa is capable of .

your mother ? oh . whoops .

actually , his days of marital infidelity have long since past . now he just shtoops my mother exclusively .

mr. jefferson carver ?

hello mazel tov ! a boojee boojee boojee boo ...

mazel tov !

let 's let your tuchus breathe .

when i play bridge with all the girls , everyone has what to talk about with their sons . they show pictures . their sons are lawyers and doctors and rabbis . why ca n't i show a picture ?

okay , what 's the information ?

what are you doing ?

just praying to god that we do n't kill ourselves going over this wall .

he 's still working out some identity issues .

not if i can help it . you got any information for me ?

in fact , he 's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling christmas this year .

what 's your shpiel , santa ?

let me guess , you 're the goy who stole hanukkah .

sorry folks , i do n't do couples .

it 's friday .

maybe he ran out of ammo .

what 's going on ? why 'd he stop ?

so , how was i ?

worse .

so what 's in the boxes ? heroin ? cocaine ?

you get your money from your husband .

this is for `` mama and the kids . ''

i ca n't understand that fancy talk . you mean i 'm a gold-digger ? sure , i 'm a gold-digger -- why not ?

why not ?

is someone with you -- can i get you a drink ?

that 's just it , charlie . that 's what i 'm driving at . you could do anything in that time .

you know -- not scared enough . nothing to scare it .

and here is three tree mesa -- and here i go out of the big arroyo --

two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met

i do n't know . i want to see robles .

sure .

no , sir . that girl in the cemetery ? my cat did n't kill that girl . i told you cats do n't go around looking for trouble . if that cat 's alive , it 's out in the country hiding under a bush , starving to death .

well -- did he give you a lot of money ?

i suppose so . i suppose it will be different for us , too when everyone knows . then we will be just like other people . but these last weeks will always be our secret a lovely secret to remember all our lives .

pedro is waiting for me , too .

you must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father 's grave ...

and if you 've got cold feet honey , ill take over for you . that red dress of yours fits just perfect on me .

i know . i know . you 've got the talent . i got the breaks .

she 's a local . when the dudes come out to new mexico , they went to wallow in latin glamour . this is a bad town for blondes .

not ! i tell you . no !

no .

it was you , galbraith !

you 've thought of all this before . you know it is n't the leopard do n't you ?

yes . there have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure . there was blue beard in france -- jack the ripper in london . it 's not uncommon .

but all those fancy courses were about the dead , jerry , not the living .

i do n't know .

yes , but what sort of a man ?

a hunch -- that 's all i 've got about this leopard thing . it 's just a hunch , yet i feel it deep in the stomach . it was a man !

we had given up digging in a certain barrow . i went back and i tried again . i just had a hunch .

but he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair .

it could be a man .

i 'll take you about . got some nice things .

i can understand about the cat killing the first girl . charlie how come told me . all that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything . last night there was nothing to disturb it . just a little girl alone in a cemetery .

it does n't know how to hunt its natural prey .

jerry , i talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard . this leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with charlie how come for years and years.. that 's why it kills human beings .

sure -- certainly - but what 's that got to do with this ?

no . i 'm quite sure .

i want to ask you something .

well , i 'd best be off .

that was unfortunate .

what do you do now ?

offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit ? no . i 'm in office to protect the taxpayers money not throw it way . come on , charlie .

that 's a fact , is n't it ?

i am not interested in what somebody else thinks . you being me facts and i 'll act on them .

ask kiki . ask any woman . girls do n't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark , lonely street unless they 're with a man or expecting a man .

let me get one thing clear . did galbraith make a direct accusation ?

something 's wrong with this whole setup --

that 's why it just mauls and tears at them .

kiki , galbraith said something to me once , -- something you ought to know . we were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel -- they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves . that 's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way .

jerry , i want you to be soft . you are soft -- inside - where it matters . i wanted it that day too , but did n't dare tell you .

how do you know ?

did n't you take your cut out of the closing check ?

absolutely sure .

kiki -- it was n't the leopard .

yes .

do they close up every year for this processionist business ?

yeah .

well , does everybody love us now ? you 've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors !

what did he have to do - look at the body ?

who was the other man ?

are you all right ?

and i never will -- you know what 's between us - we 're a thing -- but this is serious -- big competition .

no not yet .

makes no difference . get him out .

get it out of here !

and i never will- you know what 's between us we 're a thing but this is serious competition .

no - not yet .

you 're too good to me .

that 's easy . me .

dial o-o-o on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink , sir .

no . thank you . ill be fine ...

you will have to ask mr de moraes that , sir . would you like a drink while you wait ?

good afternoon . de moraess residence .

de moraes ? i was asked here by a mrs spitz .

i ... we have to bury leon tommorrow ...

on ... once ... once ... what are we ... you going to do ?

no . not us ...

he ... he is dead ! my husband is dead ! call my parents . theyll tell you . call them !

do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser , deborah ? and then , your brothers not buried yet . as i said earlier , an autopsy will ...

you know something ? ive just seen so much ugliness i dont think id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time . id hoped to have a private word with adonis , but if thats the way you want it .

well , i hope you enjoyed yourself .

you seem to know what youre talking about .

we all have to like what we become . cowards included . we achieve this by complicating things a little . but its never that complicated really .

here we go again .

something like that ?

a fright ? ... five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright ?

and you still havent told me why you sent me after friedman .

five years of it . surely , youd have divorced him if he disgusted you ?

why did you send me after friedman ? to atone for your sins ?

oh no . at long last leon had found a mission . hed never have killed himself when glory beckoned . your husband killed your brother . and thanks to you , almost got me killed too .

kids are not your thing , deborah . youd have been ready for me when i turned up with sleeping beauty . damn it ! then too i should have paid more attention . not leon , you said . it struck me at the time , but obviously not hard enough . you didnt say my god ! , or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing uncle henry misbehaved . not leon . who then ? you sure were right about one thing , deborah , the job was too formidable for me . i should have thought a little more before i left for los angeles . but there i was focused so hard on friedman id stopped thinking . nothing added up - leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at 15,000 a go ; infiltrating the world of child traffickers ; duping friedman into selling him a little boy ... you sure were right . the job was too formidable for me . but you knew that , didnt you ?

if-if my car is there , i could be the one who ... why dont you accuse me of killing my brother ?

what do you mean , no , mrs de moraes ?

how ... when did you ...

whatever the reason , im sorry i did . goodbye , mr lombard . i believe you know your way out .

when did you learn about his taste for kids , huh ? on your honeymoon ? or was it later , when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother ? how did you find out ? did he confess ? try to convert you perhaps ? or was it womans intuition ? or just the way he fucked you ?

why ... i dont know what youre talking about .

ive had a long and unpleasant day . im tired and im angry . but mad ? not yet . i paid leons boy a visit this morning . found him alive and well . why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note , eh ?

whats in the bag ? underwear ? to seduce your husband ? or is it for your own recreation ? tell me , how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms ? is it because he does it with little children ?

mr lombard ...

paul lamont ... ?

not yet . the place i hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address . ill give it 24 hours . he just might show up . if you need to reach me ask for mr lamont . paul lamont , all right ?

you do want me to keep the job , dont you , mrs de moraes ?

minimizes the risks . children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses . these can also be used to move women and drugs ... anything that makes money really .

huh ! really ? hotels ?

are we understood ?

the man who sold the boy to your brother .

last night you upset my sleep . tonight my social life . we have two minutes . my dinner guests are waiting .

perhaps i should come back when youre ...

excuse me ?

i cant tell you that yet . but hes being well looked after .

i will of course do my best to hang onto it .

theres more . your brother also purchased a young boy for 15,000 .

its a snuff movie . prime paedophile material . im told it retails at around 4,000. i see you dont require a definition .

can it be that you want your brother found ?

for your information , mr lombard , trouble is possibly the one thing leon is capable of getting into all by himself . though i doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that .

was it cash , mr de moraes ? the 1,000. you gave it to him in cash ?

can you tell me how you spell ...

penrhyndeudraeth , north wales .

croissants .

nothing sticks to slime , emily . this should cover what you lent me .

a seminar in a baby breeding farm ! bodies in acid ! you think ill get anywhere with that ? jesus ! with luck i might raise a laugh . they might even send a patrol car to check the place out . whatever , itll be too late .

im finished here and im tired , emily . you shouldnt be here . now dont make it worse .

that-that wont do . thats not the way it goes . you saw it , you tell it , thats the way ...

do you know a friendly cop ?

a criminal ?

a recent acquisition . weve had four break- ins this year alone ; files stolen , computers wrecked , faeces smeared on walls . the good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders ; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us . an easy living indeed , mr lombard . i got through to moreau and jane . i left your landlord out of it . your flats been broken into . jane wants you to call her back .

french people need a visa to enter this country . that takes time and i didnt have any . i used a british passport . my names not lamont but lombard . xavier lombard .

youre a long way from home ...

europe ... france . im french but i live in london ... ... england .

thats right . wheres the fucking italian , eh , mr french hero ?

whitney armstrong , my deputy . what whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your austrian ...

what sort have you got ?

why ?

may i have your phone number ?

what about the staff ? theyre in on whats going on , arent they ? how many of them ?

i dont know . i dont know , man . i dont even know friedman that well ... i ... man , youve got to get me out of here ...

the company . we all work for the company .

there were six on offer , you scumbag . where are the other five ?

what ?

where ?

yeah ... the diplomat .

no ... no ... i swear ...

... on holiday ?

i dont know . hes gone ! hes gone . i dont fucking know where , i swear ... hes gone . on holiday ...

where is he ?

on the bed !

absolutely , sir . as a matter of fact he called this morning , sir .

yes . how did ...

hello there . hows the flat . i cleaned ...

ive got work tonight , jane .

oh ... we split up .

i dont know . how many famous french film directors can there be ?

yes . but my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company . for expenses and all that , you know ? itd cost you about 100 but he said itd be worth it . of course , youd need a partner to register . but thats a formality . i mean , i could be your partner . i mean , just as a name , right ?

how are you , jane ?

plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education .

why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography , mrs spitz ?

we are aware of your rates , mr lombard . we will pay you double your rates plus expenses . in return , need i say it again , we expect discretion and undivided attention .

the 1,000 is on account .

im sure ... as far as you know , when and where was your son last seen ?

leonard does not hold a driving licence . as for his passport , i do not know where he keeps it .

did you look for his passport , driving licence ?

i presume you checked your sons apartment ...

do what , mr lombard ?

i take it your son is called leon ?

well , i would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning , mrs spitz . i wouldnt like to think id kept you waiting for nothing .

ho-hotel ... los angeles ... he ...

huh ... im sure thered be lots of takers .

only feeding the disease , eh , martin ?

shut up and drive !

dont jump any red lights .

no . in hampstead ... why ?

lets go .

problems ?

anything at all . i presume you wont want to take the boy with you when youre finished ? theres a 500 fee for disposal . the boy is yours , you understand ?

the rooms yours for 24 hours . its sound- proofed , stocked up with food , drink and other things you might find useful . you can do anything you like .

what is it ?

questions can amount to revelations . now , id hate to think i was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination . mr friedman led me to believe we had a deal . do we ?

the ladys not a friend . shes a whore . someone at a special screening i attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an austrian here in london . and not just movies .

your lady friend did .

yes . you wouldnt know where i could reach him ? we had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my paris gallery , you see ? i really need to see him before i leave .

evening . table for one ?

... no .

yes . three thousand pounds . i still ...

er ... yes ...

hed come prepared . he had something besides shiva ... sleeping beauty . the disney film ... well , it looked like the disney film . it was something else . i couldnt watch ...

im sorry . its just you dont look local ...

do you know leons parents names ?

you thought wrong . i havent seen leon for months .

... leons not here . how did you get here ? phil doesnt know where i live .

as you know from speaking to phil , your friend leon has disappeared , rhian . his family have hired me to find him .

reach for it and throw it to me . and ... my fingers on the trigger , you hear !

in my jacket . left inside pocket .

shut up ! wheres your wallet ?

this is private property . the public footpath is back to the left of the bridge .

three days and thats three days too many.come on . get your ass up .

now , can you stand up ? can you use your legs and stand up ?

fucked-up fucking weird .

yeah . why ? youre going to look for her ... shit ! you really think his pictures are that good ?

i take it you dont know where he is , then ?

jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre . pas avant la matine .

viens .

when they realise im missing ...

thats what he said ...

some guy called to let him know the frenchman whod called the night before he left london was in l.a. looking to kill him . he did his sums and decided to take the call seriously .

not even scum like friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call .

so why didnt he ?

if he had , youd be dead .

why did you kill friedman ?

huh ! youve been around , eh ?

the acid bath ?

youre the lantern man , huh ? if you wan na see whats left of him ...

they lost their son . why ?

moreau ? cest moi . alors ...

sure . but speak english , will ya , ha ha ...

cost what ?

but not impossible ... gilles and la hire are ready to risk everything to save her ...

jean , it 's ... it 's not so easy ...

majesty , i ca n't ...

... if she can find me ? -- that 's a brilliant idea ! if she 's really been sent by god she 'll discover the trap , and if she 's an assassin she 'll kill the wrong man ! bring her up !

i 'm not afraid of the fire anymore . it will purify me ...

i 'm staying , jean .

i -- i do n't understand ...

just give me a moment and then you 'll be free ...

we must sound the retreat !

it would not be the same without you .

will you at least let me stay with you ?

he said that ... he 's making a treaty with the duke of burgundy and ...

what did the king say ?

tell me ...

so ... even you do n't believe in me anymore ...

me ? ! it 's not me , it 's god who makes everything complicated ! if he 's all-powerful , why not let the english stay on their island in the first place ? and why let this war go on for a hundred years ? and why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family ? why , why ? !

well of course they 're me ! that 's how god talks to me . if you listen hard enough , even you can hear him . everyone can hear him .

they 've abandoned me ... like everyone .

jeanne , no ...

it 's over , jeanne . we won , just as you said !

well ...

no , it 's ... it 's nothing , it 's ...

jeanne , you 've been badly wounded ...

good .

alright , whatever -- but since he 's not going to come down and cut it himself , at least let someone cut it properly !

there 's nothing to hear -- i have n't done anything . and why have n't i done anything ? because none of you will listen to me ! !

who do they think i am ? !

now ?

yes . i did n't confess today .

no , i ... i held it up to ...

yes , probably ... maybe ...

we have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner ...

why ?

and why was that ? did it have some particular value or power ?

do you have a sword ?

ah , yes , i forgot ... god sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission ! do you think that god made the right decision , to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of france ?

did god forbid you to tell the truth ?

no no , you do n't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous ... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown king clovis in this ... very ... cathedral ...

well ... at the coronation of king charles vi ...

but we ca n't do that unless she admits to blasphemy ...

it is not for us to burn her , my lord . that is your prerogative .

so long as this bitch remains alive , our armies refuse to fight ! do n't you understand ? they want proof that god is on their side ... and the only way they 're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch !

well then ? start proving ... or else the church will have another martyr !

to hell with procedure ! we paid a bloody fortune for this slut , and we can do whatever the hell we like with her , whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear ?

rouen is in english territory . i have the right to do anything i like . take them away .

my king will pay any ransom you ask .

so ... here is the famous jeanne ... savior of orleans ... terror of the english ? you look pretty ordinary to me ...

i 'll be right here ... i promise .

i ask only one thing ... to hear me in confession ...

please ... may i have it back ...

yes ...

the voice was in your cell ?

when exactly ? a day , a week -- when ?

i assure you they do . so ... answer me ... when was the last time you heard this voice ?

jeanne , you are not helping yourself . if you do n't answer our questions properly , your refusal will be taken into account .

jeanne , listen to me very carefully . we are all men of faith , and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own . we do so in the name of our holy mother church , who never closes her arms to those who would return to her . but we can not help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority . take heed of this charitable admonition , for if you persist in refusing our help , then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers , and i think you know well enough the punishment that would await you . so now ... will you please recite our lord 's prayer ?

how old are you ?

show us a little more cooperation first . where were you born ?

my name is jeanne . my little cross i had round my neck was taken away from me . i would like to have it back .

i do n't know what you 're going to ask me questions about . you may ask things that i wo n't want to answer .

the english ? ?

trial ? what trial ? ?

pierre cauchon , bishop of beauvais . as you were captured in my diocese , the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me .

this word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation . in fact what we -- the church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by god , as she claims . you understand that we can not allow just anybody to abuse god 's name in this manner ...

do n't worry , charles . if god is still with her , she will be victorious . we 're not her judges ... we 're just spectators . let her go to compiegne , as you let her go to orleans , and let god decide her fate .

peace will only be got from the english at the end of a lance !

well ... we are , of course , enormously grateful for your past efforts , but your task is done . now it 's time for negotiation ... and after many months of skillful work , our dear tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the english . you see , my dear jeanne ... as it is written in the bible , `` to everything there is a season : a time for war , and a time for peace '' ...

why did you betray me ? paris was ours for the taking ! all i needed was another few hundred men ... why did you take back the army you gave me ?

get them out of here !

orleans has held out for six months . i do n't suppose a few days will make much difference . take some rest .

he said that i have to save france from her enemies and give her back to god , and he told me that i -- jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at rheims to be crowned king of france .

you did well ...

noooo !

i ... i do n't know ... it 'll sound like we ... betrayed her ... ?

tremoille , i 'm not even king yet ... who 'd want to assassinate me ?

not exactly . she wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse . bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury , i fail to see how you can afford such an adventure .

that 's enough ! you will answer the question ... or face the consequences !

go on to the next question .

i must offer to the duke . i will give you his answer tomorrow .

it is all his majesty can afford . he has even donated his very own personal savings . his majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families .

that 's not a lot .

the english wo n't wait .

i know what i 'm doing , so either lend a hand or go back to bed !

what 's going on ?

knowing what i know ? enormous gratitude .

you know , i feel a great sorrow for you , because you 're laughing now , but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of god .

you may have been with your counsel , but i 've been with mine , and i 'm telling you , god 's counsel is wiser than yours , and he 's telling me to speak to the english -- now !

for what ?

god ... why of course -- we 'd forgotten about him ! strange , i do n't seem to remember seeing him at agincourt .

do you know how to count ?

jeanne , look behind you .

right behind us -- dunois with another then thousand men !

we return to orleans ... across the bridge , at the tourelles .

i do n't think . i leave that to god . i 'm nothing in all this , i 'm just the messenger .

and ... what does jeanne think ?

but will you also submit to the decision of the church ?

do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin ? no one is allowed to destroy the life that god created !

you do n't believe me anymore ?

jeanne , if you do n't mind ... i 'll stay standing ... this armor ... it 's a nightmare to get back up ...

take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first !

i 'd sooner die than use magic !

then , lord dunois , show me the way to the other side of the river ...

sorry jeanne ... did you both meet already ?

la hire , i 'm warning you -- do n't swear !

what about all those dresses you were given ... silk dresses were n't they ?

five steeds and a few hackneys ...

who gave you that horse ?

you know what you just signed , jeanne ? you just signed away my existence ... for you i 'm a lie , an illusion . you see ? in the end , you were the one who abandoned me ...

are you willing to follow all his commandments ?

are you going to leave me too ?

`` love your enemies '' ...

what for ?

i do n't agree . why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time ?

yes ... yes ! and now you tell me why god let all these battles happen in the first place ... if he 's so powerful ... he said he 's `` the creator of heaven and earth , the source of all life ... '' he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery ? why did n't he ?

no ! i do n't want to know anymore ! leave me alone ! i did n't kill that man !

god asked you to do something ?

why not ?

who ?

i do n't know -- i do n't care anymore -- i just want to be at peace !

that 's too easy . one minute you want to die , the next you want to live ... do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you do n't want it anymore ?

you 'll be dead soon enough anyway , so why be in such a hurry ? why not face up to your lies ? it 's your lies you ca n't stand anymore ...

i ... do n't know ... what do you want from me ?

you think god is n't big enough to deliver his own messages ?

i -- i -- i ...

what have you done to me ?

i want to be at one with him now .

i do n't want to wait for his call .

he says ... he says i must be good ... and help everyone ... and take care of myself . do you think he 's coming from the sky ?

beautiful .

who is this `` he '' ?

and what about your other friends ... you do n't like playing with them ?

jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time , we 'd spend our whole life in church .

he already did , but i want god to forgive me too .

whose were they ?

but you already confessed this morning ...

i need to confess .

why are you here , mr. wladek ?

you ca n't , it 's too dangerous .

i 'm going to get a doctor .

and how 's yurek ?

i 've been in hiding . i need somewhere to stay .

he 'll be back before curfew .

michal dzikiewicz . he 's my husband .

come in ! come in !

you know something ? meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful .

yes , but sometimes i 'm still not sure which side of the wall i 'm on .

it costs .

tough luck .

i 'm doing you people a favour . and what about you , wladek ? you 're a great pianist . and we 've got an excellent police jazz band . they 'd welcome you with open arms . join us . you 've got no work ...

someone 's got to do it , henryk .

we 're recruiting .

your work , yes , playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto , they do n't give a damn about people 's sufferings , they do n't even notice what 's going on around them !

do they ?

you 'll be deported .

otherwise what ?

you 're mad , that 's your trouble , you 're mad .

you 're out , are n't you ?

what are you talking about , my tie ? what 's my tie got to do with anything ? i need the tie for my work .

it 's not funny .

i know .

that 's better than yesterday .

no . three hundred and sixty thousand , so it 'll be easy .

a good place for what ? he 's insane !

they 're in shock . they did n't expect it . nobody expected it . jews fighting back ? who 'd have thought ?

i 'm not , but majorek is .

i did n't know you were in the certificate business .

not this week .

you 're too well known , wladek . and you know what ? you musicians do n't make good conspirators . you 're too ... too musical .

but i want to help , i want to .

bad news , you crazy ? you have no world view , wladek , that 's your trouble . the news could n't be better . the moment hitler invaded russia , i knew we 'd be all right . remember napoleon . same business . the germans will freeze to death , please god .

i do n't know why i come here every evening , it 's always such bad news .

the germans are advancing on kharkhov .

yes , i know , but jurek , jurek ...

jurek ? wladek szpilman .

dirty pig !

how long have you been here ?

i 'm sorry , i did my best , i thought the certificates would save us all .

and what do you think you 'll do while you 're setting up a new line of defence ? wander round lugging your suitcases ?

i 've been worried sick .

you do n't want to worry about that . my grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice . in my opinion , jaundice is not very serious . drink up .

no , i do n't think so ?

tell me your name . i 'll listen out for you .

are the russians here ?

we 're getting out .

what 's happening ?

what 's your work ?

... without a shred of manners .

ohhh , it 's so dark , it 's like a dank cave .

it will be very dramatic .

watch your feet !

no , it was a table .

it 's strange is n't it ? i mean it 's not a piano , it does n't make any sound .

i thought she met your father in luxemburg .

i worry for you .

spoken words ?

no , words . you have never heard words ?

well , thank you , i expect she will appreciate it .

i do n't want to learn .

i do n't think you should have given up the piano . i will make sure you are properly taught , with music written on to sheets and ...

nothing just yet

i 'll have to come and hear you play . what do you play .

yes , why not .

well baines the music lover , i never would have known . hidden talents george .

yes , i thought that .

good , flatish land with reliable water , why ? i do n't have money . what are you about ?

no , no they know another track - to the side of this .

what 's he say ?

i have the key here , look , i 'll have it mended ...

he chopped it off

quiet down ! shhh ! where is she ?

everyone has to practice .

i 'd rather not play . i want to listen and learn that way .

you have to wash them .

i 'm sorry , i ca n't do that . i do n't have the time . goodbye

please take us to the beach where we landed .

he 's given it to us .

he wants to improve himself ... and you will be able to play on it ... teach him to look after it .

she wants it to come .

it must come .

what are ya gon na do , call the cops ?

right through there . but i would n't go in there if i were you .

at the finish , it 's single action by two , fasanella second , visitation third . line on single action ... 3 to 2. hell with it , that 's no good .

if that punk and his pals decide to search ya , you 'll never fool 'em carryin ' it there .

you 're crazy carryin ' that kinda money in this neighborhood . no wonder you got hit .

naw , it 's okay .

give it to me ! please . i got ta know it 's all there !

okay , twist , but you know if this blows up , i ca n't do ya no good downtown . gondorff is federal .

if that 's the way you want it .

what the hell you gon na do with yourself ?

i think it 's the best ...

you think my play is bad ?

how much did ya lose ?

then why ai n't he dead ?

salino ? why waste our best people on a small-time job like this ? it ai n't no heavy gee we 're after . the guy 's a five and dime grifter .

we 'll be waitin ' .

i just got the count . we 'll put the take on the 4:15 .

you the duff that did n't come up with his end when little jeff was sent up ?

aw christ , it does n't make no difference now . if snyder knows about it so does everybody else . he never gets anything first ... damn , there 's no answer at luther 's .

i did . that stuff i gave him was counterfeit . they 'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it .

you could buy yourself some things . clothes , or a nice car ...

which way did he do , eirie ?

name 's danny mccoy . no neck mccoy we called him . runs a few protection rackets for carnello while he 's waiting for something bigger to come along . me and danny been friends since we were six . take a good look at that face , floyd , cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us , you 'll have to kill him and every other hood in chicago who 'd like to do the same thing . you understand what i 'm sayin ' ?

they staked out the other guy 's place last night , but he never showed . they figure maybe he skipped town . you wan na follow 'em up ?

hackers .

combs gave it to reilly and cole .

i do n't know . could be . we 're runnin ' that down now .

you sure he did n't just pocket it ?

mottola .

all he 's got ta do is read .

you want the stuff tomorrow or do n't ya ? it 's gon na take hours just to clean it up . besides , gondorff 's still a hot item . where am i gon na be if he gets hit ?

i do n't know . this is kinda short notice . i 'm not sure we can get it all done by saturday .

you beat him , kid .

i appreciate your stickin ' your neck out . i would n't have asked ya if it were n't for luther .

take it easy , you wo n't lose him now . we had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody . believe me , i 've seen enough to know .

just a little nervous , that 's all .

you just wo n't learn , will ya . hell , you come in here , i teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know , stuff most grifters could n't do even if they knew it , and all you wan na do is run down a bullet . you 're just like all them new jerks . lotsa nerve and no brains . and ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there wo n't be one gee left who knows the big con was anything more than a way to make a livin ' .

all we need is a couple days , henry . a couple days and we 'll get lonnegan down and stomp on 'em .

then why 'd ya move outa your room ?

how 'bout lonnegan ?

if i can find a mob that 'll risk it . but no matter what happens , i do n't want you comin ' back to me halfway through and sayin ' it 's not enough ... cause it 's all you got .

right down to my socks , turkey . if i'da been half as scared a that lop-ear , i would n't a fallen asleep on 'em . lonnegan might kill me , but at least he wo n't bore me to death .

you got ta keep lonnegan 's con , even after you spent his money . and no matter how much you take from his , he 'll get more .

this is n't like playin ' winos on the street . you got ta do more than outrun the guy .

'cause i do n't know enough about killin ' to kill him .

why ?

yeh , he croaked luther . what else do i got ta know .

lonnegan after you , too ?

you gon na stay for breakfast , or do you already know how to eat ?

he did n't tell me you was a fuck- up , either . you played the big con since then .

you mean you blew it .

aw , i conned a senator from florida on a stocks deal . a real lop-ear . he thought he was gon na take over general electric . some chantoozie woke him up , though , and he put the feds on me .

he had you down as a big-timer . what happened ?

i 'm sorry about luther . he was the best street worker i ever saw .

turn the goddamn thing off , will ya .

looks like he 's sulking .

get a couple extra guys in the line , then . we 'll give him the shut-out .

not enough to cover a bet that big .

he 's gon na hit ya with 20 grand , eddie . how much cash we got ?

the wire is ten years outa date .

we 'll use the wire . never known a gambler who would n't like to beat the ponies .

if ya win it could make ya , too .

make sure you see cash from this guy , eddie . he 's got the name for bettin ' money he do n't have .

the name is lonnegan .

five and call .

lonnegan .

yeh , that 'd be real nice of ya , mr. lonneman .

i 'll tell ya what you did , smart boy . you tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from maxies . you and coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th . if he had n't been a numbers runner for doyle lonnegan , it woulda been perfect .

hi there , snyder . things a little slow down at the bunco department tonight , eh ? somebody lose the dominoes ?

all right , i 'll give ya a break . down that hall there , there 's an unmarked door on the left . go on in there and wait at the window . i 'll take this ... ... in the back and run it through right away . we 'll have you outta there in a couple minutes .

we 'll get 'em ! give us a chance . i 'm not the only agent in here , ya know . we go around advertising ourselves , how many counterfeiters do you think we 'd catch , huh ? you think i 'm wearin ' this rag here 'cause i like it ? christ , everybody thinks life 's a holiday or somethin ' when you got a badge . i been here since three this morning , charlie , and i never knew there was so much ugliness in people . you try to help 'em and they spit on you . i shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin ' false notes .

but what about all these other people ?

if i expected somethin ' , i would n't be still standin ' out here in the hall .

you move right along , do n't ya .

yeh , this time anyway .

what time you get off work here ?

no . they 're just the only ones we know of .

i feel lucky tonight .

i do n't know , figure something out .

let me talk to him .

it 's foolproof . we got a partner downtown runs the central office of the western union . race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies . all he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner . then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that 's already been run . it ca n't miss , unless the western union dicks get onto it .

you got a system , carver ?

give 'em a little time .

get on with it then .

if i 'm not there by quarter of , i 'm not coming .

that 's worth fifteen grand to ya ?

why me ? shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from .

all right , then .

what 's the matter ? you got ta get back to shaw ?

yeh , he knows that .

he cheats .

hell yes . we do n't care about the mark . he deserves what he gets .

will you wait until the chump is played ?

ca n't do it . there 're telegraph inspectors all over the place . i got 750 grand coming in from the coast , and i 'm not gon na blow it for a lousy 14 gees . we 'll get somebody else to do our betting .

all right , get outa here . you 're outta work .

all right , riley . what the hell happened ?

never heard of the place .

i 'll need a room over there that faces this way . how much a week ?

what 's your next step , nick ?

have the police got any idea where wynant is ?

of course .

is that what it means ?

then just say he was sixty years old .

sexogerarian , eh ? yes . yes . but i ca n't put that in the paper .

yes . he admitted it .

he 's never forgotten a promise to me . i 'm worried about him . i know something 's happened to him .

but tonight is christmas eve !

what 's the matter , darling ... not sweet enough ?

look -- those are the first metals that came through .

what ?

oh , andy , andy !

you 're talking like a crazy person ,

i ca n't marry you ! i ca n't ever marry you !

you do n't understand . you do n't know what 's going to happen .

do you think i care

go !

you 're sweet , but the only thing that you can do for me is to go .

do n't cry .

mother ... . you could n't do that . you could n't go to her .

you just want money -- and you have n't any right to any more . he made a big settlement on you .

he 's all right . is n't that enough ?

that is n't true . it was about your father . where is he ?

nothing .

tch-tch-tch -- well , goodbye , miss wynant . you would n't drive slowly , so you do n't get a tip .

did he tell you where he was going ?

did she make any sound ? did n't scream ?

yes . i hated her for coming between my mother and father . she kept me from seeing my father . i went down there to ask her where he was . she would n't tell me , and i shot her .

there .

yes .

i just wanted to relieve your mind . your father 's alive and all right .

thanks . we will . goodbye .

yes .

are n't you nick charles ?

only in bad weather .

he 's all right .

we were planning to be married right after christmas .

where are you going ?

you see how much we have to say .

he 'll still be your son-in-law !

forgive me . how are you ?

must have been in the war . that might account for the cane and his limp .

i 'm very interested in that body .

not a thing .

did they find any clues ... a gun or fingerprints or anything ?

what is it , gilbert ? tell mother ! what did he say ?

get anything ?

i 'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him . i want to see where he goes .

did you know he was hanging around julia ?

i have n't got that far yet . but i do n't think that everything points to wynant . what about the alibis ?

yeah . could n't find a thing . this is the way we figure it . wynant goes to julia 's apartment . he finds morelli there ... sees she 's two- timing him . they have a fight . but he figures he do n't want to do anything then ... . morelli might squeal . so he goes away . he do n't let his lawyer know anything has happened ... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to julia to give to him , so that julia will think it 's all blown over . then , when she do n't expect it ... he lets her have it .

what about the suicide ?

man to man , mr. charles , are you working on this case ?

this gun yours ?

yes . i might not have been shot .

how 'd you people happen to pop in ?

yes . but he did n't show up .

about three .

well ... .

i said he had n't written me .

no .

you say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came ?

where were you ?

maybe if you quit running around after other women you would n't have so much trouble with this one .

never mind .

i thought you said you were n't going there .

chris -- chris -- !

you would n't do that ... you would n't !

just what i said i 'd do .

what are you going to do ?

then someone was in with you . who was it ? -- who was it ? i 'll answer that -- hello ... hello ...

i never had it .

what did you do with the rest ?

that 's a fine thing to throw up to me after all i 've been to you ... .

i want that money right now , or i 'll hand you over to the police .

do you realize that you 're accusing me of ... .

this is the first time i 've seen him in years . i did n't want him to think i was high-hatting him .

oh , please , nick .

that 's all right .

good morning . i 'm afraid this is n't a very `` merry christmas '' for you .

i wish you 'd count them . there 's a thousand dollars there .

it would n't hurt to put it in .

what 's all the fuss about ? is he in hiding ?

i see . i see .

my wife 's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things . and i 'm looking after them .

she usually is . trying one way or another to get money out of wynant . i wanted to find out if you were er - er - -- sleuthing for her .

that 's all right . what are you drinking ?

macaulay , you drew up wynant 's will . mimi was cut off , was n't she , if she re-married ?

perfectly absurd .

this is all very pleasant but why are here ?

they 'll want more than your word for that .

i tell you -- he did n't do it .

that 's not for you to decide . everybody 's under suspicion - especially running off like this -- the police will want his description . is this a picture of him ?

where 's gilbert ?

yes ...

dorothy ! is she here ?

but he knows you . all you have to do is get in touch with him , and tell him that mimi says everything is all right ... but that i 've got to see him .

well , do n't you ?

oh , nick ... nick !

once i wanted five grand -- cash -

what 's that ?

i 'd tell you if i knew . but i 'm not in this . ask the police .

listen . `` studsy '' burke told me you used to be o.k . that 's why i 'm here . do they ... .

why tell me ?

i hope you 're well .

why are you saying it ?

mimi !

i 'm going to give a party , and invite all of the suspects .

i 've got a lulu -- why ?

i 'm going to get the real murderer . i 've got an idea . want to see me take him ?

i ca n't help it . i ca n't tell a soul . i did n't even tell guild .

then he could n't have committed those other murders .

how long has he been dead ?

nick , you 'll drive me crazy . what things ?

that 's what they think ... guild and all of them . they take it for granted that it 's just another of wynant 's victims . guild 's hot-footing it around now , looking for wynant . that 's all that troubles him .

he was down in the shop .

i want you to stay and find wynant .

you dog !

you would n't be a widow long .

go on - go on - see if i care . but it 's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to new york just to make me a widow .

i know but this is different . he 's a crazy man . he might kill you .

you mean , he might be hiding there ?

what are you going to do ?

this may be a little rough - you 'd better let us go alone .

so am i .

sit down !

yes . it 's asta 's christmas present .

i do n't know .

philadelphia . then he did n't do it , did he , nick ?

are n't you hot in that ?

macaulay .

hello ... send him up .

you did .

want a drink ?

there 's one coming .

it 's all right . it just grazed me .

that 's great . i was afraid i 'd have to go to sleep .

i think i would like that drink . i 'll give you your christmas present now if you 'll give me mine .

darling , my guess is that wynant killed julia and dorothy knows it . and the police 'll catch him without my help .

good . i want to talk to you .

too bad you did n't bring your whip .

nothing , 'til i find out if it 's the gun julia wolf was killed with . keep her in here , and do n't let those reporters see her . they might believe her .

she brought it in . trying to make me believe she did it .

what are you drinking ?

room service , please -

six martinis .

much better , thanks .

only you , darling ... lanky brunettes with wicked jaws .

that 's what mr. wynant said to me . if she re-married , all the money was to go to the children .

mr. charles - she did - that 's why he got sore at her and killed her . listen , mr. charles -- i did do a little chiseling . i come to bring it back and fix up the books . i did n't want him to find out and come after me -

you worked here ?

he 's a good guy . he sent me up the river once . hey , nick !

yes . nick !

nick charles here ?

you 're forgetting the check for your suitcase . it 's at the grand central .

maybe she has .

bonds , sir ?

you did .

home ?

i just wanted to tell you ...

turn the car around .

what 's in the other direction ?

y-yes .

looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who 's better than who , do n't we , epps ? like i said ; i expected more from you .

they 'll kill you . you wo n't make it ten feet before they cut you down .

what about jaeger ?

and let me guess who is .

in the service you do , but we 're not particularly in the service right now . way i see it , what we 're doing , that does n't particularly give you the right to toss orders around .

i out rank you , that 's why .

no .

then step aside .

you do n't know he is n't .

get off him .

you got no reason to hit me . i 'm getting tired of you and jaeger pushing me around .

maybe i do n't need your ideas . maybe i can do better on my own .

maybe i do .

maybe we should split it up now .

what about it ?

all right . i 'll go up , then you send up the gold and --

you ready ?

and they ca n't fly around out there forever .

where 'd they go ?

basically . but the map has been pretty precise so far . i do n't think it 'll be too hard to --

got to be some kind of landmark ; something distinctive .

let me see the map .

there 's nothing we can do . we should n't even be here in the first place .

i do n't know , and i was n't about to mess with it .

he 's an idiot , and he 's not nearly as hard as he thinks .

you two fighting 's not going to get us anything .

deserters would have run , they would n't have engaged .

they should n't have been here .

oh , jesus , they 've stopped .

what are we going to do ! ?

damn , this is sweet . we are going to be home in no time .

a casual one .

i 'd go to australia . lot of land , not many people . i think after this i 'd like to quit people for awhile . and the girls go crazy for brothers down there .

what ?

still am . there 's more gold than i thought , and since there 's only two of us now ... where should i go ?

epps .

we had a deal . no one touches the gold until we 're out of here . no one breaks the deal , no one had anything to worry about .

but ...

we ca n't just sit here waiting to die .

... maybe ... maybe we can fight our way out .

i do n't know !

what do you make of them ?

sun rises in the east . we go the opposite direction . may not find anything , but at least we 'll know we 're heading towards saudi arabia .

we ca n't stay here . even if that was n't an iraqi soldier it 's only a matter of time before some show up . get all the water you can carry , and we 'll head out on foot .

i do n't know . he did n't have a uniform on . he ... he had on white robes , like the guys who killed wes .

do n't go bitch on me now ! you were going to kill me . kill them !

well , you 're going to start with a bang , 'cause you 've got four of them to take down .

they must have thought we were iraqi when you yelled to them . they could n't tell in the dark .

probably .

hell , they 'll probably just surrender to us . probably .

yeah , i guess we should .

well , we should identify ourselves .

what do you figure it is ?

epps ... epps ! i 'm gon na stop for a second .

i pick that way .

wonder how the war 's going ?

makes two of us .

you still got a map on you ?

and you ; you 've got it all together .

what if he 's not ?

we ca n't just leave him .

we got to go back . we got to go back for wes .

you think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you 're wrong , and you 're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it . we 're heading northeast .

it should , or it will ? least going back the way we came we know what we 're up against .

there 's another pass on the photo . we can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up , and it should get us back down .

we should head northeast .

not when you 're up here with the gold , i guess not .

just had to get the pack unhooked from the line . it did n't seem that long .

i would n't know . i never imagined this . not in my whole life did i ever imagine this .

think there might be more iraqis ?

if they land --

they ca n't shoot us in here .

we 're not going to do anything .

just stay down .

where is it ? where 'd it go ?

so good bye , shi'ites . thanks for playing . we have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go .

the shi'ites are on our side ? i did n't know that .

i do n't hear any --

wes is right . if there were any more mines we would have found them . hell , that one you stepped on was probably old anyway ; left over from the war with iran .

how 's this going to work ?

it 's not falling asleep . you 've only been standing there for three minutes .

me and wes are just going to talk .

just be cool .

you did n't step on any mine .

what ?

i 'm just going to have a little sip , that 's all . just a sip .

yeah . i know . i 'm with you .

hey ... hey ! slow up . you do n't have to go so fast .

... i know .

millionaires , man .

i 'm just thinking , you know , if the rest of the boys knew what we 're doing . i mean if they knew what we were coming back with .

what ?

let 's go .

i steady it out , they blow us out of the sand !

figure they do n't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them .

we can see them , they can see us . we run , they chase .

take the goddamn binoculars !

oh , that 's fun .

third . what you 're going to do with your third .

cool it , jaeger . hey , wes ? wes ?

we go , we get rich , we go home . it 's that easy .

and you know what that area is ? it 's iraq . iraq ! we 're doing a little thing with them right now ; desert storm . maybe you 've read about it .

yeah , that 's exactly what i think . you and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes . let 's get out of here . we got sand to protect .

i did it ! i got the box open .

what ! ? what ! ?

i 've got to have something to tell people when i get home besides i protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place .

why you in such a hurry to get to shooting ?

there might be .

blow me . have i said that to you guys recently ? blow me .

blow me .

you know what ? i think you got schwarzkopf . you did ! you got the general right in the ass . now that 's good shooting .

no you 're not .

at-at-at-at-at .

what are you doing ?

some good ones .

just ... want to be ready when we do .

that should n't be too hard to read . iraq is the pink thing .

a map ? all i got is maps . i 'm gon na have delayed map syndrome when i finally get out of here . what kind of map you need ? topographical , geographical , thermal ?

all last night he could have been --

maybe we should give him some water .

says he 's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter .

with what ? he does n't have a weapon .

you down ?

guess we know what the next stop is .

it 's got a bottom .

i 've got a new agenda now , it 's get rich . the only way the iraqis figure into that is not at all .

funny you should say that while we 're out looking for gold .

we have to do something .

those people down there are shi'ites . you 've got shi'ites in the south of iraq and khurds in the north . neither of them 've got much love for saddam . probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising , so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some .

anytime you want to do something about it just let --

how long we going to keep this up .

as soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway . we 're not that far . we can make it .

we just about got killed . you know what happened ? we just about got killed , and you want to go on ?

i thought we were dead .

iraqis .

a car is not just a car where i come from . i had this friend , had this wicked candy apple red sixty-four and a half mustang --

if there 's gold . if !

how the hell should i know how much ?

yeah . if . whatever . what kind you figure it is ?

epps , is that a sand dune .

so you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase ? it 's crazy . tell him it 's crazy , epps .

it 's real . i 'm telling you , it 's real .

at-at-at-at-at .

like i said ; so ?

yeah . so ?

you will . you 'll get it .

you get it yet ?

it 's a puzzle box . if you can figure out how to open it there 's supposed to be a treasure inside .

how do you say `` come here , baby . i 'm horny . '' i can use that now .

i do n't think we 'll go to war . we should n't even be here . this is n't our fight , it 's a regional conflict . it should be decided regionally .

okay .

control on .

too low .

4732 ... ?

permant cortex bond .

drug evasion with assorted perversions

drug evasion with ... .

no ! ... no ! ...

it 's the end .

they 're watching us now .

do n't let them separate us .

then what ? it ca n't go on forever . you know it ca n't .

i know you can do it without sedation , you can , i know you can .

i 've got a slip movement to install on my next shift . i 'll never make it the way i am now .

but ... you ...

what ?

you slipped on a t297 transfer just before lunch , did n't you ?

you 're not cleared for this precinct . let 's cross over first .

what are you doing here ? is anything wrong ?

it 's 3+27 hundred

but it 's so hopeless ... you 're so beautiful .

what ? ... oh , no , thx . that 's not true . not satisfied ? thx , i need you so much .

that 's not food . ca n't be food .

do n't be so sure .

no , do n't make trouble . it 's nothing .

you do n't have to ... i do n't trust him . you ought to file a report .

a shelldweller . they live in the outer shell of the city . quite unique , there have been two here before . they smell .

what ?

then why are they holding us here ? why do n't they destroy us right away ? economically , it 's not sound at all . very much unlike ... .

we 're leaving .

we must escape . we have plans . we can leave . we must wait until ...

out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings , there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals , most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted .

i ca n't see him at all . he 's been destroyed .

but you ca n't ... you .

right now .

i thought of something ... ..

just look at all those people .

look more closely .

remember this ... ?

she 's not there

i 'm all right thx rises and they begin to walk along the passageway . at the end of the hall is a small metal door , a sign read `` level 842con g , division of plastic , vendable manufacturing stations '' the door is jammed and it is difficult to open . finally the latch snaps and the door swings open .

i do n't care .

what kind of answer is that ?

what ?

that way .

no , i ...

... to me . i think i 'm dying .

yes ...

my mate has been acting very strange . i ca n't explain it ... ..but . i have n't been feeling very well myself . i do n't know , maybe it 's me . i needed an sp9 last night . i feel as if something odd were happening to me . something ... .

... .going well . how could i be so wrong . sco 1202 cross wired a 904. he 's been receiving extra credit . he offered me some .

one partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night . name 's carl taylor . long record of arson , assault , the works . the other print - we got nothing from our data base or the fbi or cia ... still waiting for interpol .

we just got a bomb threat upstairs .

hey , that 's the guy-

f 2600 block of lakefront . a limousine . but , i-

officer reilly , vice .

are n't you on suspension ?

make up your mind , trigger .

nothing .

me , too .

catch that alert ? that 's him in the u-haul .

no you 're not , you just do n't understand them . here , do what i tell you .

i guess i did n't realize how much i needed him . he kept me straight . it 's been tough every second since .

pittsburgh , two years ago . partner died , no back-up , i was too gung-ho . as usual .

you do n't have to talk about it .

so cut both .

not bad for bomb squad , eh ?

bingo !

look , it 's a longshot ...

then , it 's got ta be here somewhere ...

i do n't know . you tell me ?

now wait just a fucking-

when you need us , you love us , when you do n't , we 're shunned by the rest of the department .

we can start in the area where the robbery occurred .

who the heck 're you ?

political .

`` punks '' , huh ?

hey , matches are a very big thing in our line of work .

it 's from an ira .

whadaya mean ?

call upstairs , see what you can find out .

reilly ! he 's loaded !

a bowling alley .

c4 , plastic explosive .

let 's get something straight . we 're doing you a favor . you 're not exactly a guy we want around explosives .

yeah , he 's helping us work up a profile on this thing .

he 's my brother ...

son-of-a-bitch ... my nose ... this fuck-up is interfering with-

what about the ballistics report ?

still waiting for a miracle . go ahead .

that 's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it .

scorch marks ... looks like they used silly putty .

good boy , schnoz . daddy loves you .

i do n't know ...

pooch , can you move it ?

no shit . i better send meg flowers just in case .

yeah , just a nick ...

one of these days you 're gon na get tired of fighting the shit . when that happens , you 'll wish you had family .

you will , one day at a time . i 'll be old and grey when it happens ...

look who 's talking , old man .

that feeling wo n't last long .

my first undercover assignment . i got ta look good , right ?

p.e.t.n ...

make an appointment .

reilly , vice . i-

we 'll keep him pinned in , you guys hurry up !

it 's our only option .

glass , you 're to stand by with your team .

i did n't . but i had to try .

report on the case so far .

i thought i told you --

diamonds all over .

and diamonds in the front .

no !

where did you find it ?

still studying the vase . mariette appears . he turns to her .

why did you let this man in , m'sieu filiba ?

the representative of the police wants to know how much money you had , m'sieu filiba .

no .

no ... have < u > you < /u > ever been in vienna ?

you 've < u > never < /u > been in venice ?

but before i say goodbye i want to ask you one question : have you ever been in venice ?

i wanted to say goodbye to you .

you see -- no , no ! and < u > yet < /u > -- < u > did < /u > i -- did -- now < u > where < /u > could we have --

well -- then it must be my mistake . i beg your pardon .

insignificant ... he 's a secretary , always < u > was < /u > a secretary , always < u > will < /u > be .

like it ?

you know , i 'm not the marrying type . i like to take my fun and leave it .

good morning , major .

yes , baron . moon in champagne .

yes , baron .

yes , baron .

yes , sir ? what shall we start with , baron ?

m'sieu monescu !

monescu .

what do you mean ?

otherwise i 'll call the police

it may be important to you , m'sieu giron --

i am only insinuating that you are nervous .

are you insinuating that this is not an honest report ?

i was only asking if you are related to the lavals of marseilles .

um-hum !

and you , m'sieu giron , seem to be disturbing my examination of < u > this < /u > < u > report < /u > .

for more than forty years . so madame told me .

m'sieu laval , i have enjoyed the confidence of this family --

i hope so , too .

i hope you find the figures correct .

thank you , major .

goodbye -- madame colet and company !

you < u > have < /u > to get out of here !

what time is your rendezvous ?

< u > also < /u > , < u > um < /u > < u > zwoelf < /u > < u > uhr < /u > .

hello ... is this the spanish consulate ? this is doa ignacio fernandez . my husband and i are leaving tonight for berlin ... is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? thank you , thank you . how long will it take you ?

at twelve twenty . i know . lyons two , four , seven , one . two more days and we 'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more !

yes -- filiba ! venice -- grand hotel -- room two fifty-three --

darling , remember you 're gaston monescu . you 're a crook . i want you as a crook . i love you as a crook . i worship you as a crook . steal , swindle , rob -- but do n't become one of those useless , good-for-nothing gigolos !

certainly !

but it 's not enough !

you ! and she 's willing to pay as high as fifty francs !

no jewelry ! hands off jewelry ! if we 're broke -- all right . i might pick up a million-franc necklace . but in times like < u > these < /u > when we 're doing a < u > cash < /u > < u > business < /u > -- why take a chance on jewelry ?

and her < u > jewelry < /u > is worth a fortune !

seven and nine !

and tomorrow is the fifteenth . and the day after tomorrow --

and take the twenty thousand francs ...

darling ! now tell me -- tell me all about yourself . who are you ?

what time is it ?

please . when i came here it was for a little adventure -- a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow . but something has changed me -- and it is n't the champagne . the whole thing is new to me . very new . i 've got a confession to make to you . baron , you are a crook . you robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three , five , seven , and nine . may i have the salt ?

but she talks a lot . and before this night is over , all venice will know it . and tomorrow it will be grand canal gossip ! ... oh !

why should you ?

do you know the marquis de la tours ?

but you came . and you must forget everything -- except that you are here , countess .

the tennis player . he saw me . he bowed . what could i do ? i nodded . baron , i should n't have come !

the marquis de la tours . he was in the lobby . but i do n't think he saw me . i 'm positive he did n't . thank heaven ! ... but when i came up here , right out in the hall there was king boris of alconia !

who ?

lovely .

then why are you afraid to let me prove it ?

why not ? he 's a thief -- he 's a criminal .

and you expect me to believe that ?

but why talk about robbery on a night like this ?

ah , let me have a little fun .

i know it .

you 're conceited --

any minute i want !

i know all your tricks .

like that ?

yes , i would !

m'sieu laval , i 've got a confession to make to you ...

precisely .

goodbye .

good night .

marvelous .

together .

then lunch in the bois --

well , we 'll have breakfast in the garden .

what are you going to do with my day tomorrow , m'sieu laval ?

and so will m'sieu giron .

i 'll be delighted .

then you use the wrong lipstick --

then i mislay my checkbook --

but , madame , you keep a hundred thousand francs -- in your safe -- at < u > home < /u > ?

oh ?

beautiful specimen .

as you like .

and do you know what i 'd like to have you do with that check ?

that 's too dark .

too much blue in crimson .

please , madame colet , i believe in doing things correctly . shall we continue ? two hairpins , one cigarette lighter , one box of real matches , and -- oh , yes , this letter from major --

then you go into the foyer .

well , the evening is still young . let 's go down to the living room and talk it over . it 's only ten o'clock .

jacques !

but my dear m'sieu giron , i 'm having a tea party . must i be bothered with all these papers now ?

mademoiselle gautier -- or whatever your name is -- i thank you for your advice , but i must ask you to go . you 've got your money --

i think you 'd better go .

how much is your salary ?

so he would n't be confined so much to his office --

no , he < u > works < /u > too much . he 's chained to his desk . too much detail . now , if you could take over some of his work --

yes , madame ?

may i ?

two lumps , madame ?

well , where is it ?

but you saw it here .

no -- i 'm sorry .

apparently not . do n't you know where it is ?

mr. andrews , thank god ! where would the master at arms take someone under arrest ? !

yes , i understand . thank you .

please tell only who you must , i do n't want to be responsible for a panic . and get to a boat quickly . do n't wait . you remember what i told you about the boats ?

yes . in an hour or so ... all this ... will be at the bottom of the atlantic .

lewis ...

look , brock , she 's going to do this her way , in her own time . do n't forget , she contacted you . she 's out here for her own reasons , god knows what they are .

i 'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother . i came down here to tell you to back off .

do n't you mean work me ?

this is brock lovett . what can i do for you , mrs ... ?

how it 's going ? it 's going like a first date in prison , whattaya think ? !

what could possible be funny ?

none of the stewards have seen her .

it 's just the god damned english doing everything by the book .

you know i do n't like that , rose .

all part of my charm , ruth . at any rate , it was my darling fiancee 's beauty rituals which made us late .

your daughter is much too hard to impress , ruth . mind your step .

tell her that her daughter died with the titanic .

where are you going ? to him ? is that it ? to be a whore to that gutter rat ?

maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on .

but i was with him the whole time .

it was once worn by louis the sixteenth . they call it le coeur de la mer , the --

no thanks . i 'm heading back .

you see ? is my destinio ! ! like i told you . i go to l'america ! ! to be a millionaire ! ! capito ? ? i go to america ! !

sorry , you 're not gon na see your mama again for a long time ...

oy , mate ... that was a close shave .

bollocks .

i do n't understand a one of you . what 's the matter with you ? it 's your men back there ! we got plenty a ' room for more .

captain , the press knows the size of titanic , let them marvel at her speed too . we must give them something new to print . and the maiden voyage of titanic must make headlines !

i promise .

you 're going to get out of this ... you 're going to go on and you 're going to make babies and watch them grow and you 're going to die an old lady , warm in your bed . not here . not this night . do you understand me ?

it 's getting quiet .

i 'll wait here .

come with me , jack . i jump , you jump ... right ?

it did n't seem like much of a bump . i 'm sure we 're okay .

you 're trembling .

are you nervous ?

he 's an ex-pinkerton . cal 's father hired him to keep cal out of trouble ... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch , after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town ...

jack , i --

rose , you 're no picnic ... you 're a spoiled little brat even , but under that you 're a strong , pure heart , and you 're the most amazingly astounding girl i 've ever known and --

i like that . are n't we supposed to wish on it ?

i did , did n't i ? look ! a shooting star .

a mistake ?

time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin .

i saw that in a nickelodeon once , and i always wanted to do it .

yeah ; it was great money ... i could make a dollar a day , sometimes . but only in summer . when it got cold , i decided to go to paris and see what the real artists were doing .

a whole ten cents ? !

listen , buster ... i hate caviar ! and i 'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head .

no , no ! just with her hands .

yup . that 's one of the great things about paris . lots of girls willing take their clothes off .

yes , exactly !

here i am . i ... i want to thank you for what you did . not just for ... for pulling me back . but for your discretion .

that 's quite a moniker . i may hafta get you to write that down .

hello again .

help ! help ! !

freezing . maybe a couple degrees over .

i ca n't . i 'm involved now . if you let go i have to jump in after you .

no you wo n't .

take my hand . i 'll pull you back in .

and wake me , of course , if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful .

yes , like a mill pond . not a breath of wind .

i do n't think i 've ever seen such a flat calm , in 24 years at sea .

we were pissin ' in the wind the whole time .

you think she was really there ?

then we 're all meeting your grandmother for the first time .

i 'm afraid i 'm feeling a little tired , mr. lovett .

rose , tell us more about the diamond . what did hockley do with it after that ?

it 's been 84 years ...

i tracked it down through insurance records ... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy . do you know who the claiment was , rose ?

how can you put this on my shoulders ?

rose , this is not a game ! our situation is precarious . you know the money 's gone !

mother , may i introduce jack dawson .

baloney !

i like touching you -- poison ivy . you 'd just been kissing that girl when i came in , had n't you ?

will you leave me alone ?

and < u > do < /u > bring miss marsh -- -- when she 's had time to tidy up a bit .

i 'll join you later .

yes -- i met miss marsh . in fact , she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances . what 's the matter , miss marsh -- are n't you feeling well ?

do n't be crazy -- i 'm tickled to death to see you .

here 's to europe ! could n't try to look a little less glum , could you ?

i never want to go back ... .

how 'd you ever get away with it ?

no -- i 'm furious ! -- nobody seems to do anything about it --

yes -- and < u > very < /u > popular --

is n't she lovely ?

good afternoon --

i do n't understand .

get moving --

i 'm making it to you . if i do n't get it by tonight -- you 'll find it a < u > rough < /u > voyage .

aces full .

i 'll bet a couple of hundred .

we have n't any chips , mr. brett -- do you mind playing with cash ?

make it five .

you ca n't lose me , sally -- i 'm no lily myself !

what do you know about them ?

who with ?

oh , that 's mrs. rosson -- remember , you met her yesterday ?

you did n't ? -- i guess i forgot to tell you --

what , again ?

would you like to take a turn around the deck with me ?

you said it ! how about a little action ?

do n't let 's talk about it .

for once i 'm dead on the level -- -- crazy about you !

you do n't know anything about me . if you did , you probably would n't be here .

decent ? i guess any guy could be decent -- if you were interested .

thanks .

i must say you 're persistent -- -- it 's kind of flattering .

you 're forgiven if you do n't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage .

when ?

but i 'll have cocktails with you .

very -- your mother ?

a little boy that has escaped from his nurse and --

oh , yes , i am , because < u > afterwards < /u > -- up here in the moonlight .

you 're not very ambitious , are you ?

this is great . i 'll be able to watch your act every night .

she looks like a lot of other boats . i grant you she 's beautiful .

i would n't miss this boat for a million .

i 'd < u > like < /u > to be . sailing on the < u > progress ? < /u >

on the drunk .

what is it ?

well , if that 's the case , you 're sure of winning the first couple of hands -- but what about after that ?

you know where that sense of humor 's goin ' to get you one of these days --

a dollar forty -- out of the two dollars i gave you .

no , sir ?

this is a business trip !

quick , let me have that money . i 'm broke and i 'll need it for tips .

he 's a colored man in chauffeur 's uniform carrying a basket of fruit .

it 's your deal .

i 'll bet a couple of hundred -- i wonder what 's keeping that boy .

come in !

thanks . that makes us square .

mmmmmmmmmhm ... . now , jimmy , what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired ?

do n't be too smart , jimmy -- you 're out in the rough yourself . you had an argument with lother a couple of hours before he was killed -- but i 'll deal with that later --

nooooo ! -- going to catch up on my reading . i 'll take this one .

this has nothing to do with me -- but always remember , purser , when you 're searching anybody , take the lining of their coat , like this -- -- run your fingers all along these seams ... . then -- back of the collar -- < u > here < /u > -- that used to be a favorite trick -- and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe -- like this .

no , thanks . i 've promised to play cards .

how about you ?

no , thanks -- i 'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in --

if he lets you down i 'll try my hand at sleuthing -- bet i could find that bracelet --

sorry -- but i 'm on a vacation --

yours , too . are you the mckinney , the dentist on calumet avenue in chicago ?

i wo n't -- i 'll ask for one right now . sally tells me she 's in love with you .

she was to meet me here -- why do n't you wait ? she ought to be here any minute .

wait a minute -- let 's match for it .

i 'm sorry to hear that .

no -- i 'll take sally and give you the best of it .

now that that 's settled , why not make the game a foursome ?

well , there 's no use in sending it . see that -- i saved you seven twenty !

next month is june .

your wife knows that , do n't she ?

`` will -- be -- back -- in -- four -- weeks . '' you do n't need the `` will be . '' just say `` back in four weeks . ''

then you do n't have to tell her -- cut out new york .

sure .

in new york .

i was never stiffer in my life .

she 's in new york .

i thought i put you to bed .

hello , denby !

< u > nuts < /u > to you too !

i can see where i wo n't talk much to you .

that 's me !

knots !

what ?

is this your gun ?

oh , nothing -- only i wondered why you suspected him .

well , i 've seen him here and there . what 's on your mind ?

hello , inspector -- i hear your vacation 's been spoiled . somebody lost a bracelet .

oh no -- i do n't want to impose on you -- it 's funny about that billfold -- i could have sworn i had it-

you can always tell how much a man 's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board .

here we are , folks -- eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad -- they go mad as chad denby -- with the arms of iron , and the nerves of steel -- picks up his racket -- what is this thing -- a racket or a mallet ?

miss marsh .

why -- do n't you like him ?

very --

< u > he < /u > does . here 's your quarter , brett .

guess they 're dull -- nothing for you to reform .

chad denby broadcasting -- -- the nicest man i ever knew --

it was n't only that -- ned was in a jam .

you made it possible for us to get away at a few hours ' notice -- you never asked why , but i guess you know .

no -- not much -- excepting --

well , that 's something -- even if only the fish can see it .

why do n't you be a good little boy and leave her alone ?

oh , all right -- see you later , toots .

is that one of the who 's who ?

-- and he has sex appeal .

so have i -- i can get it right out of my trunk .

everyone but me -- what do you want now , mary ?

mr. denby -- what do you think i ought to do with that part ?

what 's the matter , mary ?

very good , mary --

what happened to you ?

about twelve hundred .

how much did you lose ?

you ca n't bluff me any more .

why ?

no !

why should < u > i < /u > kill him ?

maybe you will after you 've thought it over .

say , `` thanks very much ! ''

exciting , was n't it ? where 's jimmy ?

what 's the matter ?

well , i 'll be a son of a sea cook !

thirty one 's and two ten 's ?

thank you .

there you are , sir .

if he comes near you again , i 'll break his neck --

what ! -- are you crazy ?

because you ran after me .

i saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe .

nothin ' .

well -- get a move on yer -- then get back to yer station .

everything in order , sir ? what are < u > you < /u > doing here , my lad ?

oh , my god ...

why ed , what an ugly thing to say ! does this mean you 're not my friend anymore ? you know , ed , if i thought you were n't my friend i do n't think i could bear it .

is n't that a daisy ?

god damn son of a ...

ed bailey , you look like you 're just ready to burst . well call me a fool but i guess i 'll just have to call . cover your ears , darling .

what d'you think of the singer ?

actually , you know , that 's not a bad idea , send a signal we 're growing up .

so how 's tombstone treating you ?

my man ? you told wyatt you 'd disarmed those men . do you actually believe after that i could see you as my man ? you 're just a dirty little fixer .

not now . i do n't have time .

absolutely nothing .

i saw that look on your face just now . what 's between you and wyatt ?

where 'd you get that horse ?

i want them spitting blood !

no ...

well ... 'bye .

they were all gon na jump me back there . what ever happened to one against one ?

make you a deal . my brother took over the marshal 's office in tombstone . got it in his head he 's gon na make the place safe for widows and orphans . you and your boys stay out of his way , i 'll make sure he stays out of yours .

already got a guilty conscience , might as well have the money too .

forget it .

i beg to differ . we started a fight we never got to finish . play for blood , remember ?

here it come : one-two-

credat judaeus apella .

yes , i know . you are a good woman .

better .

what 's wrong , doc ?

you think i 'm kidding . you 're the most fallible , wrong-headed , self- deluding , just generally benighted jackass i 've ever known . yet , withal , even at your worst , you 're the only human being in my entire life who ever gave me hope .

hurts . hurts pretty bad .

rather an obvious question under the circumstances , do n't you agree ? a better one might be how do you feel ?

i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry , wyatt . god , i 'm so sorry .

doc ...

but doc-

you will or you wo n't . do n't look to me . i 'm going to sleep .

and what a maiden , pure as the driven snow , i 'm sure .

forgive me if i do n't shake hands .

that 's what i love about wyatt . he can talk himself into anything .

i said poker 's an honest trade . only suckers buck the tiger . the odds are all with the house .

did n't you always say gambling 's an honest trade ?

i do n't believe it . he 's clean !

then why in hell 're you doin ' this ? you ought to be in bed .

ca n't take the heat , get outta the kitchen .

i 'm your man ... you win again . well played , sir . you are on fire .

colorado 's closer

all right , what 's it to be ? new mexico 's that way .

all right wyatt , maybe you can . but you got ta die to do it . understand ? you got ta die !

cards in spades . i 'm in love with every second of her life . hell , i 'll probably love her when i 'm dust .

are you out of your mind ? what on earth 'd make us-

hello , wyatt ! hiya doc !

we 're the law , ai n't we ? well the law do n't ride around vermin-

wyatt , listen , you ca n't beat him . you 're good and god knows you got the courage , but you ai n't in ringo 's class . hell , he 's the best that 's ever been . 'cept maybe for wild bill .

not so sure . somethin ' tells me it gets harder from here in . should 've held out for more money .

there they go . look kinda like preachers .

i forgave you the moment you said it .

sorry about your friend . and i 'm sorry about ...

i did n't mean it that way .

getting late . we better get back .

i hate sadie .

easy to fix . wyatt berry stapp earp .

i do n't know , does n't make any sense . i almost ca n't look at you . like it hurts .

the way you talk . never heard a woman talk like that .

see ? you 're laughing again . but that 's what i want . go places and move and never look back and just have fun . forever . that 's my idea of heaven . need someone to share it with , though .

room service .

how would you know ?

nothing ... tell me , what do you want out of life ?

i 'm not touchy , i just , it 's a silly question , that 's all . am i happy ? are you happy ?

i laugh sometimes

fun though , was n't it ?

you know you almost got us both killed back there ?

that was lovely !

i have a better idea , let 's run it out of them !

oh ... now she 's starting . how do they know ?

easy now ... that mare 's in season .

look , mattie , i know you're-

admit what , i 'm an opium fiend ? no , wyatt , i just said i need it . i need something to keep me warm at night .

'least you admit it .

mattie . what about this ?

sure i 'm sure . what is this ?

no , no , i do n't want to keep you .

wyatt , i could n't find a single store that had laudanum any-

'least they do n't scare women .

is n't there anything i can say that 'll change your mind ? you 're gon na stay with your new friends ?

that what you got me up here for ?

well hello , sherm .

we 'll go around that way , come up on foot .

drop his horse .

remember about the light you 're supposed to see when you 're dyin ' ?

will somebody get the damn dog out-

you 're on .

i just got it fixed .

get down , boy .

that thunder 's sure somethin ' .

i know , kid . i know . me too .

fine . better .

come on , we 're not about pickin ' fights . just gon na keep a little order , that 's all .

i 'll be damned ...

hope so . clean up with this boy .

hey ! virgil ! my god ! morgan ! hey , boy ! you look great ! both of you !

yeah . it 's a fact .

you back that queen again , you son of a bitch , i 'll blow you right out of that chair ! somethin ' on your mind ?

sure ...

got a sheaf of federal warrants . being in the territories it 's up to our discretion how they 're served . that means we got the cowboys without quarter . the black flag , brother . no prisoners , no mercy , amen .

no , damn it , it 's wrong , they 're breakin ' the law .

they 're carrying guns in town .

you 'll never make that stick .

pretty fun too , is n't it ?

i ca n't hardly believe it . it 's working out just like you said , wyatt . we 're lootin ' this burg six ways through sunday .

i know , i need a keeper .

her maiden name was sullivan .

well we 're off and running . just acquired us a quarter-interest in the game at the oriental .

look pretty rough .

but she doted on the frowner

ike clanton , old man 's eldest son . know he ai n't got the stuff , makes him miserable .

see what i mean about it getting spooky ?

what about all these saloons ?

i appreciate your assistance , m. but this is now a military operation .

what do they say in russia , general bukharin ?

why was n't the ship protected ? ! ? ! why was it sailing without radar ?

... as the advertising says : tomorrow never lies .

- instant melt-down .

precisely , mr. bond . in a matter of minutes , the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor ... and when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -

do n't pout , sidney . i invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story . he 's from 'lloyd 's of london . ' ... are n't you , mr. bond ?

... words to live by ?

fantastic idea mr. bond ! perhaps i should buy it for a book ! it 's totally preposterous , but - you amuse me . ... and now perhaps i can amuse you .

they 're merely tools to disseminate information .

welcome to the new world order , mr. bond . churchill had his armies ; caesar had his legions ; i have my divisions : news , sports , business , entertainment . and these are my foot soldiers : 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers , 4 cable news networks , 87 magazines , and 29 different cable tv channels - in 35 languages .

sightseeing .

by the way - what is it that brings you to kuala lumpur , mister bond ?

still , i do miss her . i only wish she could have lived to see all this .

sir elliot .

i 'm on my way .

a piece of advice , mr. bond : do n't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton . it 's deadlier than uranium .

it 's a beautiful boat , sir elliot . practically glows in the dark .

maybe you should talk to sidney winch . owns a marine salvage company . nobody knows more about the strait .

i appreciate your time -

moneypenny ! how indiscreet ! have you ever known me to kiss and tell ?

hello , james . enjoy your meeting ?

moneypenny ! we 've got to stop meeting like this . they may be on to us .

i 'm sure she is , james . but i 'm afraid you 'll have to 'kiss off ' the rest of your lessons this afternoon .

... 17 beverage cup holders ?

your new car .

do i have to dial ' 9 ' to get out ?

that hardly makes up for the imposition . now , for what i hope will be the very last time - pay attention , 007. first , computer generated retrograde analysis map . body here , meteorolog- ical influences here , likely vector- ing of the ship 's coordinates here .

that 's absurd ! it took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold .

yes -

i 'm so sorry , james . i promise , i 'll never leave you again .

no ! he 's crazy - he 's insane . he hates everybody . he 's got these plans - you 've got to help me , james . i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry for everything . i know i was wrong - but you 've got to protect me . i know you still love -

nothing .

political considerations ?

occasionally , yes . british media mogul . born in hong kong ; controls newspapers , tv , radio , cable , satellites ; books , magazines , movies , computer software . theme parks .

big game fishing . sonar torpedoes . retirement gift from his friends at the cia .

well ... if you insist .

i dunno , jimbo . it ca n't be out here . how could they get this far off course ?

can you arrange a meeting ?

we work in the dark . we do what we can .

natalya ?

let 's take a look at the body .

hey - the world is my office .

that 's reassuring .

you too .

no .

three . you ? married ?

we blast through .

if not ?

you insist on calling all the shots . and by the way : i am not a helpless girl .

another reason ? ? ? did i miss something ? ? ?

is this - like - a normal day for you ?

sometimes you just have to -

trust me .

cleans dirt . let 's go .

what the hell does that do ?

the only mistake is that they did n't kill us in the elevator .

maybe . but why are we going up instead of down ?

blood or dutch ?

listen to me ! i 'm a british secret service agent . and we have about two minutes before harmsway kills both of us .

why do n't we just take these -

so charming ! so suave ! do n't insult me . i 'm not one of your 'little london girls ' who falls for the lies .

have we met ?

bourbon . neat .

a three-thousand ton frigate does n't just vanish into thin air .

actually , you 're just in time . admiral roebuck : you know commander bond , do n't you ?

i understand .

it seems , 007 , we 've received a tip

- along with tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper . circulation 27 million . daily . -

only what i read in the newspapers .

yes , m .

tsi tien , mr. bond .

mandarin . you jerk . i 'm late . i have to get dressed .

is that mandarin , or cantonese ?

ja-shwa tsway . these are lips .

... and what do you call these ?

good for you , miss winch . you now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here .

excellent .

and the 9:30 news meeting is waiting .

no -

the american presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -

the canadian prime minister wants to set a lunch -

how is it now ?

about every ninety seconds , the auto- pilot jogs us to the west .

damn . it 's doing it again .

... i see .

you come with me - you stay here .

excellent .

kill him ! finish it !

what the hell is going on ?

good . we have an appointment in hong kong .

yes .

maybe . maybe not .

here i am thinking about myself when poor harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen .

yes .

i pay my own way .

i tried to call to let you know i was going to be late .

i 'll drive her to the hospital .

i ought to break your damn neck .

that is a damn lie and you know it . every time father asks you to do something , you either half-ass do it or run off and hide . mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her , with your smart ass self , that you were n't a farmer ; get junior to do it . every time someone asks you to do something , you always say , tell junior to do it . boy , you ought to grow up .

why in the hell did n't you help mama ?

this is what it is all about , trying to keep from being out on the street .

you all do n't believe me when i tell you i 'm afraid of heights .

and what lesson have we learned from all of this , babe br ... sam ... i mean samuel ?

it 's like i 've been swimming in muddy waters .

i told him we might not need it , if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property .

why do n't you come in for a while ?

i do n't see you crying about my drinking it .

i want sunny to have an advantage that you and i never had , but he needs discipline , and you are not helping when i tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it .

babe brother .

this would be a bad time for me to leave .

i heard his voice as clear as day . i better get back . maybe something is wrong .

it is just a regular card .

what is that ?

well , you just have to move further out .

i 'm almost finished . i 'm about to come to the punch line .

it 's healing now .

i cut it on an old rusty knife .

what happened to your hand ?

what , are you having another party ?

how is the garden doing ?

well , it 's up to suzie .

hush .

i 'm not going to let him get away with murder .

i asked you to wake me when babe brother comes .

your feet are cold .

do n't bother the poor boy . it just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are .

my mind plays tricks on me . is it okay if i take a bath now ?

you still call him boy . you call babe brother boy in front of his wife and son .

what could have caused this ? i just changed this damn thing .

how often is your wife called to help delivery ?

oh , i would feel much at home if you let me get one for you . i have n't wrung a chicken 's neck in a month of sundays . you know , folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs . that used to be my trade from time to time .

i was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner , but time got away .

boy , that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom .

he kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age .

only if you are a good man , a friend . are you a friend ?

since she has repented , all she does is throw stones .

as god is my witness , i have never done anything to that woman .

good afternoon to you .

let me earn my keep . i 'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot . try to make him some cow tea next time .

all those places that us coloreds lived , that we used to call bottoms , have all been changed to drives and heights . everything is in what you call it , not in what it is .

emory had made a lot of enemies . he had a big mouth .

strange as it may seem , it might have cleared the waters . sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason .

miss clara 's boy , emory , to start with . the johnson 's hocker was another one ...

of course not . have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people ? no you ai n't . you have to take just one and fatten him up . when you spread help too thin , you , you just nickel and dime the situation . if you try to save all , all die but if you save one life , life goes on . you just have to remember , medicine that works leaves a bitter taste .

good god almighty , bless your bones . but the problem grows .

`` out of weariness , i spoke to my own heart ; to leave it all and to die . and i gave my heart to know madness and folly . ''

i was quoting from the bible . if the shoe fits , wear it .

you know the saying , `` your heart is in your left hand . ''

well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance . do n't take me wrong but you ca n't judge people by how you act . you 're a caring person .

i thought you were n't old fashioned .

you do n't want to be at crossroads without one . it 's a charm that old people teach you how to make . i had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child . in my travels i misplaced it . i have been looking over my shoulder ever since .

i think he wants to see your rabbit foot .

if it was left up to me , i would poison him .

i ca n't accuse him just dry long 80 .

he 's just raffish . harry put him up to it . before evening sun sets , i would have his belongings back on route 55 , that old fox .

harry always shows his good side and , like the moon , the other side is black . back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman . i 'm telling you harry is nothing but evil . i 'm warning you -- you ca n't keep a wild animal as a pet around children .

how are you ?

right here in the van .

pizza planet ! yeah ! ! !

okay ...

no , i have n't seen him .

you can bring one toy ...

can i bring some toys ?

whadda ya think ?

mm-hmmmmm .

say , is n't that mistletoe ?

rocky ! the ramp !

well sure , look at him . he 's got more gadgets on him then a swiss army knife .

i wanted to thank you , woody , for saving my flock .

aach ! -- oh , hi , bo .

we 're not aiming for the truck !

not today !

you did it ! next stop . andy .

look out ! !

no-o-o-o-o-o-o ! !

hold on , woody !

yes sir !

whoa , hey -- wait a minute . being a toy is a lot better than being a space ranger .

no , woody , for the first time i am thinking clearly . you were right all along . i 'm not a space ranger . i 'm just a toy . a stupid little insignificant toy .

why , sure you can , buzz . you can get me out of here and then i 'll get that rocket off you , and we 'll make a break for andy 's house .

oh , come on , buzz . i ... buzz , i ca n't do this without you . i need your help .

what happened to you ?

sorry guys , but dinner 's canceled !

get away ! hoo-cha ! hoo-cha !

where is it ? i do n't see the --

c'mon , c'mon , that 's it ...

hyper-active hyperdrive , and astro ... uh , turf .

you mean it has hyperdrive ?

sorry .

go away .

buzz ! buzz , come back !

sheriff , this is no time to panic .

according to my nava-computer , the --

oh . oh , that 's good .

then we 've no time to lose ! !

no ! no , that 's scud , you idiot !

that 's why . sid .

nothing that concerns you spacemen . just us toys .

oh , yeah , tough guy ? !

that was n't flying ! that was falling with style !

i tell you , i could fly around this room with my eyes closed !

can !

you ca n't !

excuse me .

alright , everyone . you 're clear to come up .

watch yourself ! !

hello-o-o ...

everyone , it 's woody !

hi !

no , no ! turn 'em around , turn 'em around !

it does n't matter how much we 're played with . what matters is that we 're here for andy when he needs us . that 's what we 're made for . right ? everyone is now looking down , sheepish .

murderer !

oh , that is disgusting .

miss . g-6 .

mom ! ! mom ! !

hey ! !

oh no , hannah !

will you quit moving around ? !

gettin ' kind of tense , are n't you ?

oh , no !

no , no , no , wait !

no wait ! you do n't understand ! buzz is out there ! we 've got ta help him ! !

come on . let 's get out of here .

no ! no ! do n't leave ! do n't leave ! you 've got ta help us , please ! you do n't know what it 's like over here !

alright ! that 's it !

laser-envy .

hey , woody ! ? where 'd ya go ?

should n't they be there by now ? what 's taking them so long ? !

c'mon , guys ! every christmas and birthday we go through this .

were you scared ? tell me honestly .

i got it , woody !

oh , i do n't like confrontations .

woody ? who 's up there with you ?

they 're getting bigger .

sir ! no sir !

uh , hey sarge , have you seen slinky ?

what ? !

just stay where you are , corporal ! do n't move , carl . you 'll blow up . i know you 're tired ! i know your leg is cramping , but you ca n't move . do you hear me ?

oh , no ... it 's a combat carl .

i knew you 'd come back , woody !

boy , am i glad to see you guys !

not now , slink . i 've got some bad news .

hey , slinky ?

so had i .

so did i .

how long has -

did you now .

nothing ... you should n't have given victoria that guinness .

somebody could n't wait until dark .

i know for a fact he did n't take jonathon . jonathon went off by himself .

in my pocket .

finn -

can i come into bed with you for a little while , i feel terrible .

you 're only a young thing .

go away .

i want to go home .

i did n't know about the puppets . it 's a lot to take in , all at once .

a sin against < i > what ? < /i >

he 's a pyjama case , really .

there 's not .

there 's no mirror .

juliet who ?

oh no you ca n't . get on with the painting .

did you do this ?

well , i hope it stays that way .

judge wakefield , it 's an honor to handle it for you . consider it gone away . she 's a minor ; it probably would 've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway .

what is he planning on telling them ?

no .

he 's right . they 'll do it when you 're walking somewhere , make it look like street crime .

arnie , help me . does n't anyone owe us money ?

helena , if i had it i would give it to you , but i do n't have that kind of money .

i suspect he 'll accept his payment in publicity .

of course he is . i 've known him for twenty years and he does n't jaywalk ...

that 's a very apt analogy , helena . now , go home and be with your children .

i do n't know , but under no circumstances would i talk about it here . i want you to go home and relax the best you can . continue your life as if nothing has happened . that is very important .

what is he being charged with ?

listen to me carefully . first of all , carl is n't here . dea 's got him and they 'll hang on to him until arraignment , which will probably be tomorrow . so here you 're wasting your time . are you with me ?

carl , that 's insane .

it 's saturday , arnie . you work too hard .

my leica 's gone .

i do n't know .

i have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day . that 's different .

no , i do n't think so . leave me alone , give me money . that 's what i get from our daughter . she has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar .

look , i 'm as worried as you are --

the first thing we have to do is present a unified front .

to begin with , she 's only sixteen years-old .

honey , this is difficult , but we 've all had our moments . i tried --

how well do you know this boy , seth , who was driving ? you know the police have charged him with a dui and possession of marijuana .

are you going to ?

not yet .

helena --

we 'll get through this , i promise . i 'll make it up to you --

you ca n't make me .

like i give a fuck .

where is it ? where are the drugs ? where are they ?

you do ? what else you do ?

private ?

in school ?

yes .

i think so . if she did n't she should have . i 've only got maybe an hour . then volleyball practice is over and i have to be home .

then here 's a little bump .

maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --

we live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us .

inhale the smoke and hold it .

remember when we sat on that mob guy , that chef , for like six months ?

she 's your girlfriend . open it , talk about your kids .

i do n't know .

you want to make a wager on this ?

they 're whispering . i ca n't hear them , but i know it . i smell conspiracy . i feel the lie vibrating out of the home .

that 's a big word for a fisherman .

we got you on tape making the deal . we got you bragging about the quality . we got you bragging about your business . we got you .

chill out --

nope .

your friends at warren , putnam and hudson .

women 's room , stall two . should we stop for ice-cream ?

especially tiger woods . ... actually , he keeps his on the back seat .

all the professionals keep them in the trunk .

what are you ? a mouse ? get out of the car and do it . this is your chance .

they 're going to walk right past me .

i do n't know . eduardo ruiz is the only real witness against carl . the security is very tight . there may not be a way .

when will you do it ?

you 're kidding . ca n't you shoot him or something ?

you were followed by the police , but they wo n't hear us over the children . i want to use a bomb .

you may speak .

carl and i were friends from childhood . he was loyal , that 's not a mistake .

so you pay off our customs officials ?

carlos , i mean carl , started out in the family connection business : real estate in tijuana , fishing boats out of ensenada , hydroponic raspberries . he met up with the obregon brothers of the tijuana cartel who were interested in two things : entering society and using his fishing boats .

we can protect you .

you ca n't visit me here . i want my lawyer .

i am a legitimate business . fishing boats . tuna . check it out . tax records , everything --

nobody said shit , eduardo --

i do n't know , sir .

deliver that safely to tigrillo in san diego . and we have a deal .

you will help me with my other problem .

exactly , and this is how i know i 'm not getting into business with the u.s. government .

every part , from his ears to his accessory belt , is high-impact , pressure-molded cocaine . odorless . undetectable by dogs . undetectable by anyone .

not in ...

you do n't ? listen to this woman in a man 's world , a very violent world .

we keep our mouths shut .

go home . get cleaned up . get to work . salazar is heading down to mexico city next week and i 'm not getting left behind . do n't fuck this up .

oh , really . general salazar was there ?

who ?

a group of us are going out tonight .

the police wo n't find your car .

please . filing a report will not help you find your car .

they would n't do it in front of all these people . they 'd send someone later , when we 're alone .

what 's he doing up here ?

was n't that general salazar ?

you should feel good about this .

somewhere safe .

but will he be house-trained ?

everybody has a weakness .

a small thing . nothing really .

what is it you want me to do ?

i 'm trying to bust the tijuana cartel .

one question . how did you find about this ?

we kidnapped noriega out of panama . is that covered in your constitution ? because it is n't in mine .

we ask questions and measure the answers . when something does n't ring true , a fact that does n't make sense , a slight hesitation , then it 's off to secondary for a closer look . before nafta we had about 1.9 million trucks a year . now it 's almost double . pretty soon there 'll be mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as american truck companies .

what do you look for ?

i want your money , i 'll take your money .

who the fuck do you think you are ? where the fuck do you think you are ? why the fuck do you think i should n't just put you in a dumpster ?

you want to help ? stay the fuck away from her .

what ?

can you tell me anything ? do you have any ideas ?

oh , man --

let me ask you a related question . we 've talked about the supply side , but what about demand ? what is your policy for treating addiction ?

i 'd like to bring you up to washington , walk you around our side of things , and share some of the information we 've been able to develop on your cartels .

hello .

i see where you 're going with that , but if i could just say something , which is basically that a guy like landry is so autocratic he does n't know how to let himself be helped ; it 's a point of pride to take every bullet , no matter who fired it , or whether it was even aimed at him , which personally i think it very self-defeating . now , do n't get me wrong , he 's a man of enormous integrity , but there 's a political component to this job that the general just did n't have any patience for .

i do n't know . i do n't think there 's any one person . see the problem is the juarez cartel owns everything and everybody , all the property on the mexican side , sometimes all the property on both sides . warehouses , transportation , even tunnels . it 's very organized .

who do we interface with on their side ?

mapping the fucking pig genome . we 'll call your dad , he 's a neurosurgeon --

you 'll never catch us , you flabby bastard . right , see , when i come back --

i 'll be right after you .

well , why did n't you bring them ?

no . on you go .

you were in my way .

shut you mouth or you 'll be next .

yes , you fucking do . i 've seen your statement .

let 's face it , it could have been wonderful .

i 'm a fugitive from the law . i ca n't be seen on the fucking streets . now watch my lips . kempton park . two-thirty . five pounds to win . bad boy .

can you not go yourself .

hey , i 'm wanting a bet put on .

unless you get caught .

it 's iggy pop .

well , it is n't .

is that a promise , then ?

easy for you to say .

and that 's what 's illegal . do you know what they do to people like me inside ? they 'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet .

holding hands ?

jesus .

no argument . you can sleep on the sofa in the living room , or go home . it 's up to you .

it 's where i live .

where 's that ?

where are you going , diane ?

what 's your name ?

what happened ?

i read it in cosmopolitan .

i did n't either . what the fuck is it ?

i bet lizzy told him where to put it .

do you recall the school motto ?

oh , really ?

i 'm an old boy myself , you know ?

i 'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now .

well , sub us , then , mate . i 'm expecting a rent cheque .

aye .

are you getting out much ?

but try too hard --

it was just an idea .

i ca n't believe you did that .

you 're a real mate . and what about tommy ? have you been to see him yet ?

and i got a stitch stuck between my teeth , jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off .

did he -- you know ?

say something , mark , say something --

all i 'm trying to do is help you understand that the name of the rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory .

some of his solo stuff 's not bad .

tomorrow afternoon . usual set-up .

ok , so who was it , then ?

nineteen-sixty-seven .

people think it 's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite , which is not to be ignored , but what they forget - spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it . otherwise we would n't do it . after all , we 're not fucking stupid . at least , we 're not that fucking stupid . take the best orgasm you ever had , multiply it by a thousand and you 're still nowhere near it . when you 're on junk you have only one worry : scoring . when you 're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite . got no money : ca n't get pished . got money : drinking too much . ca n't get a bird : no chance of a ride . got a bird : too much hassle . you have to worry about bills , about food , about some football team that never fucking wins , about human relationships and all the things that really do n't matter when you 've got a sincere and truthful junk habit .

sure will , pal , sure will .

sounds great , swanney .

as you wish .

that 's hardly a substitute .

he knows a lot about sean connery .

such as sitting in a darkened room , watching videos , drinking , smoking dope and wanking . does that answer your question ?

what ?

we go for a walk .

i 've got balls like watermelons , i 'm telling you .

it 's a nightmare . she told me she did n't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in .

no joy yet .

no . well , yes . i have to admit it : i 'm a perfectionist . for me , it 's the best or nothing at all . if things go badly , i ca n't be bothered , but i have a good feeling about this interview . seems to me like it 's gone pretty well . we 've touched on a lot of subjects , a lot of things to think about , for all of us .

you doubt me ?

he has his doubts ...

it could . yes .

it was not . the barrier stood between us - but we breached it .

my visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees .

return to prearranged coordinates for pickup .

in firing position . torpedo armed .

um ... yes . we 've been caught in a blizzard !

admit it . we 're lost .

i do n't have a clue .

but the shuttle-

i instruct you to surrender . you are under attack by federation forces .

we will be happy to beam down . but first we must have certain assurances .

this is captain pavel chekov speaking . you are in violation of neutral zone treaty . i advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences .

this is the starship enterprise .

no , but you can bet they will .

your orders are to proceed to nimbus iii , assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible . above all , however , get those hostages back safely .

i apologize for canceling shore leave , but look , we have a dangerous situation out on nimbus iii .

perhaps i have a way to bring one here .

a starship ? there are no starships on nimbus iii .

join my quest .

captain , we ca n't trust anyone now .

aye , captain how many times do i have to tell you ? the right tool for the right job ...

you told me you could have the ship operational in two weeks . i gave you three . what happened ?

go , sulu .

transporter room . status .

put it on the screen .

mr. scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft . the transporter beam is non-operational . captain , we 've received important orders from starlet command .

not possible . you were never alone .

spock , i thought i was going to die .

there is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room .

that he 's found it . sha ka ree . the reason sybok left vulcan .

this , er , person ... did n't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble , did he ?

how do you know ?

there , you see ? see ?

you ordered me to kill my brother .

i ordered you to defend this ship .

if you think it would help .

be one with the horse .

spock .

when he encouraged others to follow him , he was banished from vulcan , never to return .

he believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion , not logic .

not general korrd .

spock , we 're on leave . you can call me jim .

that song did not come up in my research , captain .

i 've always known ... i 'll die alone .

i do n't understand .

i believe dr mccoy is not in the best of moods .

spock - what are you doing in this neck of the woods ?

what have i done ?

about the ship ...

i do n't control minds . i free them .

you ca n't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the great barrier .

i 'll take you to the bridge .

sybok , listen to me . in order for this craft to enter the landing bay , enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam . to get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-

no ! no reply . remain on course .

james t. kirk , captain of the enterprise .







maybe you could wait until i 'm a wee bit stronger i do n't think i could take it in my present condition . or yours .

easy , easy , easy , scotty . easy . you 're back with us .

i had a feeling you would say something like that . so i brought us dinner .

no . you must save yourselves . forgive me , brother . forgive me .

sybok , we must find a way ...

sybok - this is not the god of sha ka ree - or any other god !

why not ?

spock ?

do you ?

i know you better than that .

should n't you wait till your lawsuit 's settled ?

i know , i met him .

my dinner .

hi , alan .

oh my . meanwhile , kids are putting eight million quarters a week in space paranoids machines and i 'm not seeing one dime .

yepper . and vice squad , and meltdown ... whole slew of 'em . i was this close to starting my own little enterprise . but : enter ed dillinger . another software engineer -- not so young , not so bright , but very , very sneaky . one night , our boy flynn goes to his terminal , tries to read up his file , and ... nothing . a big blank . we now take you to three months later . ed dillinger presents icom with five video games he has `` invented '' -- the slime did n't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion . thus begins his meteoric rise to ... what is he now , executive v.p . ?

sherman , set the wayback machine for ... oh , 1973. kevin flynn is one of the brightest young software engineers at icom . he 's so bright that he starts going in there at night , and sets up a private memory file , and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing , called ... ... space paranoids .

i do n't get it .

tried to . ca n't quite make the connection with that sucker , though . if i had a direct terminal ...

i 'm certainly not .

i do n't think i 'm cleared for this .

you call that getting over it ?

flynn had group 7 access .

ever since he got that master control program set up , system 's got more bugs than a bait store .

boy , i sit up there grindin ' away all day , and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun .

ok

ah . sounds good . well , we should have you running again in a couple of days , i hope .

yes !

this town 's full o ' live ones .

no , nuh-uh , never in a million years !

no ...

oh . anything else ?

what do you mean , `` 'yes '' ?

so do as i tell you . keep that tron program out of the system . and get me those chinese language program i asked for .

you would n't want me to dig up flynn 's file and read it up on a vdt at the new york times , would you ?

and i was planning to hit the pentagon next week ...

cute .

i think we 'd better shut off all access till we can find that file . just to be safe .

flynn ?

i 'm sorry , walt . so much pressure lately ... you feel like going for a drink ?

the mcp is the most efficient way of handling what we do . i ca n't sit and worry about every little user request that --

hmm . a difficult proposition ... difficult proposition at best . perhaps you 've noticed ... we 're not exactly packing them in these days ...

aah , i 'm fine ... little hung over is all ...

yes .

i hate to disappoint you , pal , most-the time , that 's how it is for users , too .

it 's time i levelled with you , tron . i 'm a -- well , i 'm what you guys call a user .

no big deal . i ought to know my way around that light cycles routine ... i mean , i did write the program for it .

what , just the three of us ?

alan !

shhhhh .

elementary physics ... a beam of energy can always be diverted ... ooh , my head are we there yet , mommy ?

there 's another beam !

are you kidding ? i think it 's stealing us -

feel what ? you okay ?

yeah , but i 'm remembering all kinds of stuff . like ... my user wants me to go after the mcp

flynn ! look , tron , he survived !

how 'bout yourself ?

you have any idea how much i can sue these jokers for ?

okay ... flynn , i 'm gon na put you at my terminal , down in the laser lab . we 'll be up in alan 's office .

do n't even say that . you 've got to find that file before he does..

i 'm afraid it 's a little late for that . dillinger 's shut off group 7 access . he must know what you 're up to .

hey ! good to see you guys ! nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple .

yes , and now you 've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation .

now , sir ... we did take care of that user you sent us --

i hope you 've enjoyed being a command program , sark . i wonder how you 'll like working in a pocket calculator ... maybe one of those watches that plays `` happy birthday '' to its user once a year .

yes ... acknowledge , master control ...

but-what if i ca n't ... ?

now get this straight , pal -- no one user wrote me . i 'm worth a couple million of their man-years ! i 'm bigger than all those little wimps put together ! humans they ca n't even keen their social order in one piece

i 've got a little challenge for you , sark -- a new recruit . he 's a tough case , but i want him treated in the usual manner . train him for the games ... let him hope for a while ... and blow him away .

we might be capturing some military programs soon ... that interest you ?

do you know what he 's talking about ?

we have to .

what do you think ?

the users ... you really think they 're still there ?

another free program off line . what 's his user s'posed to do -- ?

new guy ...

it 's something users do .

nice ...

power surge ... the transmission beam 's too strong !

how ?

that 's all going to change , yori ...

i ca n't believe how bad it 's gotten around here since the mcp started taking over ... all the good functions have shut down ... everybody looks so dead ... i 'm afraid to even go out during down-time ...

oh , tron ... i knew you 'd escape ... they 've never built circuit that could hold you ...

yori ... hey ...

then you better do something to * jumpstart that man 's motor . you know ... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion .

no you 're not . you 're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake !

where are you going ?

you 're going to stay in school . do you understand ?

there are going to be some changes dana . you 're going to start following some rules . and i 'm going to be there to see that you do .

fine .

he lies ! i was there ! i was in the nurse 's office , cause i had a headache .

dana , mr. hardy called . why were n't you in class today ?

okay . let 's step up the surveillance on her . put on two more guys .

sorry .

if i break it they can take it out of my pay .

it 's show time . do n't look at * the flash . do not look at the flash .

here they come .

i can get 3 marine corps harriers here in about 12 minutes . they 're on maneuvers out of boca chica .

-- you tell the son of bitch this is bright boy alert . repeat , a bright boy alert . and i need a patch of the white house asap . that 's right --

let 's go . i 'll brief you in the air .

i 'm giving her an assignment . i am offerring you a choice . if you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life . if not , you will go to federal prison , and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone . your like will be destroyed .

what about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job ?

she 's still at my house . *

yeah , but for who ? *

yeah , and we do it twenty times a day . do n't give me that crap . just put on the taps . now .

what 're you talking about ? we have that .

you want me to just hang -- ?

son of a bitch !

station wagon ?

she could be moving money , guns . anything .

she 's importing stuff from all over the mid-east .

you better watch it . she might file on you for sexual harassment .

she knows not to steal . i 've taught her better than that .

what ?

what a team . see you at eight .

got it . nice touch . okay , pick me up at eight . the de-brief is at ten hundred .

what 's this for ?

switching to sub-vocal . gib , you copy ?

look , if you ask me everything twice , this is going to take a really long time . and i have to get home to my family .

but he 's not exactly ringing your bell lately , right ? i mean --

no ! never !

is this a common thing for you ? cheating ?

yes sir .

janice , how many years have you been buzzing us in ?

sure . say that now .

is that why you got into this business ?

it 's certainly ... dramatic .

i adore it .

not yet . but we 'll find him .

i told the guy -- - i told the guy , this is n't even my order .

we must be in the florida keys . * . . the overseas highway * connects the islands to the mainland .

if we 're on an island , why are they using trucks ?

as much as you used to ?

tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again .

god , you have great legs .

are you a total lying , scumsucking pig harry ?

she 's really a fox , is n't she ?

is it working yet ?

i do n't know what this crazy bitch is on . you should just cut her loose , so we can get down to business .

you would n't believe me .

what were you doing there ?

let the hooker go . she 's not important .

sure , hon .

the code name of your contact will be boris . your code name will be --

you will be contacted with the assignment .

let me out of her ! right now !

yes .

and you agreed ?

he wanted me to go with him on a mission , to pose as him wife .

harry ? what can i say about harry ? he 's a sales rep for a computer company .

he needed my help .

so , a little excitement in an otherwise dull day . did is work out okay ?

they said you had to run out .

yeah . it was great .

i 'm sorry . thank you for the party .

i 'll handle it .

yeah . you should have seen it . we were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system , the one for the 680 ... how you can write up an order and the second the customer 's name goes into the computer , it starts checking their credit , and if they 've ordered anything in the past , and if they get a discount ...

me too .

beat it .

you son of a bitch . did you really think you could elude us forever , carlos ?

yeeaoowww ! !

see . you and this car were meant for each other . why fight it ? sure , i have a couple other buyers lined up , but i like your style . whattya say ? should we start on the paperwork ?

some kinda legal secretary of something . married to some boring jerk .

i always have a couple on the hook . you know . there 's one right now , i 've got her panting like a dog . it 's great .

dickless . if they took care of * business , i 'd be out of business , know what i mean ?

exactly . the trick is , you got ta pick your target . they have to be nice little housewife types . school-teachers . but , i 'm telling you , you get their pilot lit , these babes , they can suck- start a leaf-blower .

does n't matter . i like change . you know , constant turnover . as soon as i close the deal , it 's one of two more times , then adios .

absolutely .

uh ... well , okay then . you sound terrible . i 'll run out right now . just call the prescription in to the pharmacy . sure , no problem . bye .

what ?

of course . mrs. tasker . and what were you going with the international terrorist , carlos the jackal ? taking dictation ?

hold that thought .

now just keep your knees together , and you 'll be fine .

no , you do n't understand , we 've been married for 15 years --

helen .

thank you . you saved my life . what 's your name ?

what is it you need me to do ?

to our assignment .

you 'll call me then ?

three of them . hardly worth * talking about . two wo n't bother * me again .

you recognized my style . see , you 're very good . you 're a natural at this .

sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation . see -- two men killed in a restroom , and two unidentified men in a running * shootout , ending at the * marriot ...

did you read the papers yesterday ?

where were you ? on a ... uh , * mission ?

the same place . one o'clock . i have to go now . see you tomorrow . remember , i need you .

yes . i suppose so . where ?

yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes ...

oh , you 're speaking of my charming wife mrs. alabama worley .

this motherfucker sounds charming !

slapped her around a little . punched her in the stomch . it was pretty scary .

well , i would n't go so far as to call him nice , but he 's treated me pretty decent . but i 've only been there about four days . he got a little rough with arlene the other day .

`` heroes for sale '' ?

that 's where trouble comes into paradise . but the boss let 's you borrow some money if you need it . wan na see what `` spiderman '' number one looks like ?

with that son-of-a-bitch walkin ' around breathin ' the same air as you ? and gettin ' away with it every day . are you haunted ?

can you live with it ?

no thanks ? what does that mean ? means you ate before you came down here ? all full . is that it ? naw , i do n't think so . i think you 're too scared to be eatin ' . now , see we 're sittin ' down here , ready to negotiate , and you 've already given up your shit . i 'm still a mystery to you . but i know exactly where your ass is comin ' from . see , if i asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down , i 'd say to myself , `` this motherfucker 's carryin ' on like he ai n't got a care in the world . who know ? maybe he do n't . maybe this fool 's such a bad motherfucker , he do n't got to worry about nothin ' , he just sit down , eat my chinese , watch my tv . '' see ? you ai n't even sat down yet . on that tv there , since you been in the room , is a woman with her titties hangin ' out , and you ai n't even bothered to look . you just been starin ' at me . now , i know i 'm pretty , but i ai n't as pretty as a couple of titties .

well . that makes us practically related . bring your ass on in .

look , dillinger , lee donowitz is not a pimp -

in case of what ?

in case .

um , nothing , let 's go ?

clarence .

let me handle this .

two guys .

the zoo . what are you waiting for ?

ok , call 'im up and arrange a meeting , so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff .

what 's this acting class guy 's name ?

drexl 's dead . this is clarence 's coke and clarence can do whatever he wants with it . and what clarence wants to do is sell it . then me and bama are gon na leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin ' . so , you got my letter , have you lined up any buyers ?

you 've got a helluva lotta coke there , man !

for the very first time in my life . do you know what that 's like ?

that 's a pretty amazing story .

what ?

you got it .

say it , goddamn it !

they 'll be along .

no problems on both counts .

he says wednesday at three o'clock at the beverly wilshire . he wants everybody there . he 'll talk to you . if after talkin ' to you he 's convinced you 're ok , he 'll do business . if not , he 'll say fuck it and walk out the door . he also wants a sample bag .

then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me ?

no . no , you do n't .

what do you think , eightball ?

- that you 're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -

yeah , ok .

you know , i saw it on the stands , my first inclination was to buy it . but , i look at the price and say forget it , it 's just gon na be the same old shit . i ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later . man , i was ever wrong .

have you read the story on elvis ?

me too , boris .

now , that 's practically uncut . you could , if you so desire , cut it a helluva lot more .

like that merchant-ivory clap-trap . all those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books .

i do n't think that 'll be necessary . let 's all have a seat . boris , why do n't you be nice and get coffee for everybody .

yeah , well , just stay outta trouble . remeber , you got a wife to think about . quit fuckin ' around . i love you son .

i got some money i can give you -

who is he ?

nope .

you got it all worked out , do n't you ?

i 'm your son .

you were a cop .

you 're always making jokes . that 's what you do , is n't it ? make jokes . making jokes is the one thing you 're good at , is n't it ? but if you make a joke about this - - i 'm gon na go completely out of my fuckin ' head !

look , i do n't know this is pretty heavy-duty , so if you wan na explode , feel free .

she seems very nice .

uh , yeah ... there 's a party store down 54th .

i can , but i do n't .

come again ?

uh-huh .

i do n't believe you .

i have a son of my own . about you boy 's age . i can imagine how painful this must be for you . but clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves . and i implore you not to go down the road with 'em . you can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice .

i 'm the anti-christ . you get me in a vendetta kind of mood , you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you . my name is vincenzo coccotti . i work as a counsel for mr. blue lou boyle , the man your son stole from . i hear you were once a cop so i assume you 've heard od us before . am i correct ?

i do n't know him . is he a nice guy ? you think he 'll help me out ?

it 's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago , drexl spivey .

i 'm me ... i mean , that 's me .

he 'll wear a wire ?

uh-huh .

that vietnam movie ?

you 're an actor , so act , motherfucker .

do n't blow it , elliot . he 's bluffin ' . he just told you so himself .

this guy 's gon na kill him .

hope you 're a good actor , elliot .

nicholson and i .

krinkle , this is it . we got it , man . and it 's all ours . i mean talk about fallin ' into somethin ' . you shoulda seen it , it was beautiful . dimes is hittin ' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers , i 'm hittin ' him form the right about not likin ' pussy anymore , finally he starts cryin ' , and then it was all over -

you got caught . it 's all fun and fuckin ' games till you get caught . but now we gotcha . ok , mr. elliot actor , you 've just made the big time -

naw , man , it ai n't white boy day .

you ai n't seen nothin ' like these rock whores . they ass be young man . they got that fine young pussy . bitches want the rock they be a freak for you . they give you hips , lips , and fingertips .

then , after a while sisters use to gettin ' their little pussy eat . and because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves , you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere .

naw man , i do n't be eatin ' that shit .

nigger , get outta my face with that bullshit .

no .

put it in your pants .

i 'm not wearing a bra .

no way , jos .

i 'm not gon na put that shit in my purse .

just put it in your purse .

no , i ai n't been there . but i heard him say . hollywood holiday inn . kinda easy to remember .

how do you know ? you been there ?

do you live here ?

naw , he ai n't home right now .

well , you go down beechwood ...

do you know a clarence worley ?

yes .

no .

we 're going to think about it , cole . among ourselves . we 'll get back to you .

no , sir ! i just want to do my part . to get us back on top ... in charge of the planet . and i have the experience , i know who the people are ...

uh , i think so . in the mental hospital .

well ?

wake up , cole .

this is it , james ... what you 've been working for .

what are you going to do with us ?

to find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus .

that the virus was taken from philadelphia to san francisco , then to new orleans , rio de janeiro , rome , kinshasa , karachi , bangkok , then peking .

meaning ... ? ? ?

i think it was ... i 'm sure it was 2nd street .

james , if we 're identified , they 're going to send us someplace ... but not to key west !

airports all look the same . maybe it 's ... james ! your moustache ! it 's slipping .

so we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music . so we can appreciate what we have while we have it . forgive me , psychiatrists do n't cry .

why are we doing this ?

flowers ! what flowers ?

they got your message , kathryn . they played it for me . it was a bad recording ... distorted . i did n't recognize your voice .

i ... i ... we need cash , james .

you want me to rob him ?

well , i ca n't . ... i mean ... i 'm trying to . i ca n't believe that everything we do or say has already happened , that we ca n't change what 's going to happen , that i 'm one of the three billion people who are going to die ... soon .

it was n't a tv show ! it was real !

it was ? i did n't ... know .

i thought i was in ... prison again .

okay ... you were standing there looking at the moon ... you were eating grass ... then what ?

no gun ! stars ! air ! i can live here . breathe !

you 're sure ?

the gun ! ... i lost it

it would be great if i 'm crazy . if i 'm wrong about everything ... the world will be okay . i 'll never have to live underground .

you know dr. mason 's son , jeffrey mason , do n't you , james ? you met him in the county hospital six years ago .

mason ? ? ?

lock it now !

i 've got one now .

uh , no . yes . i mean , just some scrapes ...

i just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates . so scientists can come back and study it and find a cure . so that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth .

and i was in it ? what did i do ?

about an airport ... before everything happened . it 's the same dream i always have -- the only one . i 'm a little kid in it .

something bad . is that all the music ? i do n't want to hear this stuff ...

`` if something really happens '' ... like what , james ?

you 'd prefer that ? ... james ... you do n't really have a gun , do you .

you used to call me `` james '' .

you told me you 'd help me . i know this is n't what you meant , but ... i was desperate ... no money ... bum leg ... sleeping on the streets . i probably smell bad . sorry about that . but then i saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture . i can read , remember ?

1989. six years for you . there 's the sign ! right here !

cole ! james cole ! you escaped from a locked room six years ago .

1995 ?

it 's so clean . no germs .

i love this air . this is wonderful air .

underground .

you do n't have a driver 's license , james ? or a social security card ?

because i 'm a good observer . because i have a tough mind .

what kind of information ?

does this bother you , mr. cole ?

listen , you dumb fuck ! the thing mutates we live underground ! the world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats . we 're like moles or worms . all we want to do is study the original ...

i do n't have time to go upstairs . the police are looking for me . i need to know where it is and exactly what it is .

what ... ? ? ?

it 's private .

what are you talking about ? ? ?

wiping cut the human race ! that 's a great idea ! but it 's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals . i did n't say a word about `` you know what '' .

look at those assholes , they 're asking for it ! maybe people deserved to be wiped out !

why do n't i escape , that 's what you were going to ask me , right ? 'cause i 'd be crazy to escape ! i 'm all taken care of , see ? i 've sent out word .

if you know how to escape , why do n't you ... ?

they gave you a pardon , man . whatdaya want ?

it 's about obeying , about doing what you 're told .

jose !

i asked you , why did you volunteer ?

he kidnapped you , kathryn . you saw him murder someone . you knew there was a real possibility he would kill you , too . you were under tremendous emotional stress .

i said it was bad judgment ! what else do you want me to say ?

please tell me , jeffrey , what exactly are you going to do ? i do n't have to tell you i 'm afraid .

you `` develop '' viruses and you 're calling me insane ? typical . what does this virus attack ? do n't tell me , you sick fuck , it does n't matter . have i ever `` developed '' a virus ? do i put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli ? do i inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements ? wow ! and i 'm crazy !

she knew about it , jeffrey . she knew you were going to try this .

yes , please . you said he gave a name ...

you want to go in ? examine him ?

-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d. , and he gets agitated , starts screaming about viruses . totally irrational , totally disoriented , does n't know where he is , what day it is , alla that stuff . all they got was his name . they figure he 's stoned out of his mind , it 's some kinda psychotic episode , so they 're gon na bring him ...

what ? what did you say ?

on your normal mornin ' , okay , plenty a time , but today , got ta take inta account your army-of-the-twelve-monkeys factor .

tight ? my watch says 7:30 .

any parting words of wisdom ?

we 're all just floating along like twigs in a stream , so enjoy the ride . is that it ?

think you 'll live that long ?

that 's 'cause i 've done a lot of living .

you sure got a lot of philosophy , old man .

that a fact ?

get me a dr. peppa ! i do n't want no pepsi . pepsi ai n't nothing but flavored water .

yeah , sure . you got change ?

yeah i want something . i want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop .

thirty-bucks ? that 's it ?

put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is . i 'll bet this mornings pay i 'm right .

you got two years on me . what 's that make me ?

you ai n't nothing but an old fool .

will be .

i 'll give you the money ! okay ? i 'll give you two-fifty . just . . . just , please .

yeah . just a little short . figures . i just wanted to get out , that 's all .

the ticket is thirty dollars .

thirty even .

i do n't care , just get me there .

i . . . mexico . you got a bus that goes to mexico ? that 's where i have to go .

but , in particular ?

can i help you , sir ?

i want my car .

come back when the sun comes up .

it is morning .

open up !

there you go , sweet talking me again .

i 'm taking my car , and i 'm taking it now !

no charge .

you believe that ?

hey there . i was beginnin ' to think you was n't comin ' back . you do n't look so good .

that 's a ford , not a ferrari . you going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a ford ?

to replace a god damn radiator hose ! ?

just banged my head . it was an accident .

do n't look like nothing .

hey .

truck stop up a piece . not much , but us simple folk like it .

somewhere else ? mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here . how you planning on getting it there ? you gon na push this heap yourself ?

it 's your radiator hose . it 's busted .

damn . gon na be another hot one today .

'cause harlin used to own it .

then why do you call it harlin 's ?

yep .

yeah , give me the miller .

what would a truck stop be without beer ?

ned ! now look at what you done ! are you all right ?

'cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring . that 's when she started shooting . ca n't blame her . the ring was all carlos left her when he died .

you pay toby no mind . he just likes to show off for his girl . give him a couple of hours , he 'll cool off . still want that beer ?

you know how that toby is . thinks every man he sees is after his jenny .

that was n't so bad . what 's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you ? it did n't hurt a bit .

. . .at the very least . i know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars . now , how much did you get ?

is that right ? ca n't say as i blame you for wanting to head out for a bit . i know i 've had my fill of this town . sixteen years i 've been the law and order here . so long i forgot why i ever wanted the job in the first place . help people , i guess . keep the peace . problem is there 's so much peace around here they do n't much need me . got a lot of speeders , but they 're speeding through miles of nothing so i ca n't hardly blame them . other than that , well , there ai n't much to steal . i reckon that the last big crime we had was , what would you say mrs. mckenna ? a murder ?

what are you afraid of ? i 'm the one 's got the gun . stay here .

what 's the matter ?

i picked them out for you , jake . i thought you would like the colors .

wrong number .

you idiot ! you 'll kill us both !

yeah , they 'll find you . dried up and twice dead .

no . i swear it .

i was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up .

i 'm here .

john !

but i want to say with you ,

you could give me the gun .

is that the kind of girl you think i am ? what can i do to make you relax ?

give him the money .

not me . us .

john . . . ?

i . . . nothing . i just stubbed my toe on a rock . hurt like hell . . . that 's all .

wait . what about . . . him ?

let him watch . i want him to know what he 's missing .

let 's do it here .

let 's go in the bedroom .

if you want .

oh , that 's great . we killed jake because you heard him talk about some money that you 've never seen . that 's fucking brilliant !

i 'm not sure where it is . not exactly . i never saw it . i just heard him talk about it .

the only reason i stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about jake . but i 've had nothing but time to think about it . it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here . but we 've got to get the money , baby . we get the money , i get the car , then we get the hell out .

are you sure ? about me , i mean ?

i do n't give a damn about the money . i want you , and i want to get us out of this shithole . there 's only one way to do that .

because i know you 're full of shit .

i do n't know what i was thinking , but i ca n't do it .

i think this heat is making me crazy . i was crazy to come back here , i 'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town , and i 'd sure as hell be crazy if i spent another minute in this place .

one-hundred-thousand ! ? that son-of- a-bitch lied to me .

from ?

he does n't give it to us . we take it .

where ?

i ca n't .

yeah , i guess you 're right .

you never did answer my question .

all right , grace . no more games .

such as ?

a medicine man ?

from my father . he was the tribe 's shaman .

thank you .

somewhere else . i 've never been anywhere else . just once . years ago . went to the state fair . it was nice , but it was n't nothing .

if you 're going to gamble , might as well play for high stakes .

did n't have a choice . my car overheated up the road .

was n't nothing .

accident .

it 's grace .

maybe , but if you did n't i think you would have kept on walking .

i 'm just going to my car .

think about it . how do you think i got in here ? did you hear any glass break ? did you hear a door splinter ? how did the evening end ? after you went to bed did she linger a bit ? maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked ? is that what happened ?

what are you . . . you ca n't . . . you ca n't kill me .

christ , jake , please --

then maybe this afternoon . when i sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead .

wh . . . what are you talking about ?

that 's not the reason i 'm here . i swear it .

and then with jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars . or maybe two-thousand . or twenty-thousand . who 's to stop you ? not jake mckenna , 'cause old jake would be dead .

it 's not like that .

drop it , jake .

no .

what should i do ?

maybe . . . ten-thousand . and that 's a maybe .

and what does that make you ?

do n't play simple with me , jake . you want me to spell it out for you ? i 'll kill grace if you cut me in on the money .

you just seem to attract trouble , do n't you ?

no .

would you kill her ?

would i what ?

mad like a dog in heat , i bet you were . i can tell you got a temper on you .

that 's the sweat of a man who has n't an honest bone in his body . do n't be offended , lad . a man who 's got no ethics is a free man . i envy you that . beside , i can hardly blame you . that grace has a mind of her own , and a body to match , do n't she ? eh ?

got work . i know a man who 's got a boat . wants me to sail it for him .

what brings you to sierra ?

i guess we 've never been introduced proper . jake mckenna .

yeah , i know . more careful .

aw , toby , we were n't doing nothing . we was just talking .

you 're too late , toby . we 're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind .

i hate to bust your bubble , but i was n't defending you .

oz .

i wan na play a song on the juke . you got a quarter ?

nooo !

i 'm leaving . you never have to see me again . just please , give me the ticket !

that 's right , mister . you better be afraid . i told you it was n't over , but you did n't listen . now i find you sneakin ' around with my girl behind my back .

not before i settle with you .

'cause i 'm just like dynamite . and when i go off somebody gets hurt .

they 're not very imaginative ?

i do n't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone .

yes , mr. vesci .

a hundred-forty-five really .

i had to beat it before the cops showed up . i do n't have a cent to my name . i ca n't even get my car out of the garage . i tell you , mr. vesci , if it were n't for bad luck i would n't have any at all . so , i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so i could get my car . i 'll pay it back with the rest of the money .

you do n't know the how , mr. vesci . and that 's not the half of it . i 've got your money , and i go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed .

john , what a surprise . i expected to be seeing you , not talking to you over the phone .

sure you do . everybody in town knows about the money jake kept hid in the house . it 's a wonder the mrs. here just now got round to killing him . not for lack of trying .

that 's what this is all about ? a shakedown ? you picked the wrong people . we do n't have any money .

shut up ! the both of you . ai n't neither one of you too smart . especially you , boy . do n't you think i had my eye on you since first you rolled into town ? you smell like trouble . stink of it like a ripe cesspool .

you bitch ! you were in on it froom the start !

sure , sheriff .

just step from the car . nice and slow .

nope . no problems up the road .

just cool down , son . i ai n't accusing you of anything . serves toby right to get his ass whooped . if you had n't done it , somebody else would 've .

sheriff , he did n't give me any choice . if i had n't defended myself- -

no police !

you know i wo n't be seeing you .

things ai n't always the way they seem . you got to ask yourself : is it worth it ? day comes earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart ! then you better know what it is you 're doing . < u > are you a human being < /u > -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin ' around ?

not this twig , friend . i got plans .

more or less .

... but ai n't you got a little something for the infirm ?

well , people got ta get by somehow . that 's the curse . the mines done it . all that uranium , plutonium , fuffonium , fuckononium , assononium , all that `` om '' ! everybody 's got a mother . you do n't rip up your mother . you do n't rip up the earth and take everything out . it 's like the cracker jack box says , `` the more you eat , the more you want ... . '' ...

... and everything is nothing too .

you sure got a lot of philosophy , old man .

just 'cause i ai n't got eyes does n't mean i ca n't see .

see . ai n't nothing i can do but keep him here beside me . that 's where he belongs anyways . me and jesse , that 's my dog , not anymore , but me and jesse we been pals since the war when i lost my eyes . he was just a pup then ... a companion that 's loyal , that 'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him ... i miss him . i 'll see ya later , unless i come across something worse .

what the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for ?

i think you 'd better give your pooch a sip . he looks sick .

all right , old man . christ .

what 'd you think i was doing out here with these glasses on ? sunnin ' myself ?

hell no , i ca n't do that myself . i 'm blind . ca n't you see that ?

you want something ?

you want something , old man ?

i 'm leaving . you never have to see me again . just please , give me the ticket !

yeah , i know . you 're tnt . just like dynamite . when you go off somebody gets hurt . all right . let 's do this .

oh , that tears it , mister . i 'm gon na bust you up but good . i 'm gon na bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up , and then ... and then spread them all around . that 's what i 'm gon na do . you do n't know what you 're dealing with , mister . i 'm crazy . i 'm psycho crazy .

i was n't sneaking around with your girl . would you please tell him ?

fine . i was making time with your girl . now i 'm scared to death and i learned my lesson . now can you go away ?

then maybe you should 've . look , pal , i was n't making a play for your girl .

i was n't doing anything .

two-hundred dollars ... i 'll do it ! i 'll kill her !

do n't jake me boy ! it 's a big house . you probably did n't even make it out to the desert this afternoon ...

i guess this is what they call `` ironee '' ? hunh ?

that 's my gun ... that fucking darrell !

well , i guess i have what you call a love-hate relationship with grace .

the slimy bastard who 's going to do it for you ... you 're a jealous man jake . if you ca n't have grace to yourself ... well , you 're not the sharing kind .

bullshit . you wanted me to kill her .

oh , that was just loose talk . husband gettin ' pissed off . i do n't want anybody dead .

you 're talking like a madman .

you said you 'd cut that up with the man who did her in .

talk ? about what ?

i was hoping we could talk .

i 've done a few things but i 'm not a murderer , mr. mckenna .

like you do n't know .

hey !

wait a second --

you a sailor man ? that 'd be the life . drive across the country , step on a boat and just sail away . a man could pretty well disappear like that . just sail away until all he was was a memory . i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile .

california ...

darrell 's a moron .

i guess we 've never been introduced proper . jake mckenna .

you broke my nose !

grace , tell him .

a lot that means .

i swear to you that 's all that happened . i have n't so much as set foot in your bedroom .

who the hell are you ?

how old are you ?

that 's what i thought until you came riding in . i saw your car over at the gas station . it 's a cool car . want to take me for a ride ? desert 's kind of lonely this time of day .

i was n't going to fight for you . i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend .

i hate to bust your bubble honey , but i was n't defending you .

for defending my honor this afternoon .

hey mister . mister , i just ... i just wanted to thank you .

you like patsy cline ? i just love her . how come , i wonder , she do n't put out no more new records .

that country shit all sounds the same to me .

i cut it shaving ; i know , i got ta be more careful .

hey , mister . you got ta quarter for the juke ?

no .

you got the money ?

open up !

what you want ?

when i work on a car , i work on a car .

well , that key 's not gon na work . i had to pop the lock . you did n't leave me the trunk key .

what the fuck did you do to my trunk ?

darrell .

listen to me you sorry sonufabitch . you owe me money , and this car ai n't going nowheres until i get it . and if you take another five hours i 'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it . is that clear ? now get out of here 'fore i call the sheriff , < u > who knows me < /u > .

the goddamn sign on the wall . i ca n't do unauthorized work ? what am i suppose to do ? just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket . then you get in an accident and get killed . or worse . who they gon na blame then ? they gon na blame me , and there goes my reputation .

i do n't give a fuck ! i did n't tell you to do it ! you ca n't just do unauthorized work .

i did n't tell you to replace any gasket .

you said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty .

what ?

listen , darrell , about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car , as soon as i get where i 'm going i swear i 'll --

yeah , well , i 've been around the bend a bit .

... got no day , got no date . probably ai n't worth a duck 's fart . this one here cost me $ 3.75 and it 's got every doodad you can imagine . no sir i 'll stick with this .

listen , man . i got rolled half an hour ago for everything i had .

`` that 's not just a ford , that 's a sixty-four-and-a-half mustang . ''

a goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half mustang . you know how long it took me to find that hose ?

bottom hose was shot too . rotted clear through . had to put a new one in . runs like a dream now .

hey .

you got to be more careful . hands is important . let me show you something . when i was a kid , now i do n't know if you can still see it , but i gashed my fingers in a lawnmower .

yeah , i can fix it .

if i could do you think i 'd be standing here wasting my time . can you fix it , or do i have to go somewhere else ?

you want to take a look at my car ? i think the radiator hose is --

so ?

but he 's dead .

'cause harlin used to own it .

yep .

hablar slowly , por favor . my ingles no es bien .

eh ?

got any cold soda ?

and love 's a funny thing . sometimes i do n't know if i want to love you ...

and i love you too .

i busted my leg !

when you 're finished with me , i 'm next ! i been there , baby . i been there with other cunts ... sorry , not anymore . i 'll take you as far as california . if we can make that . after that you 're on your own . try mexico . with all this bread , you can live like a queen .

you do n't believe in anything do you , bobby ?

so , are n't you going to ask me ?

you know i thought you 'd left me back there .

what the hell ? why not ? where should we go ?

hey ! take it easy . want to get us killed ?

i ca n't see it .

bobby ? what the hell 's the matter with you ?

after dark . i 'll leave the back door unlocked .

we do n't have to kill him . just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away . it was your idea , remember ? i 'm doing this for you . i 'm doing this so you can fly ... fly like a bird .

i do n't think we have anything to talk about .

i ca n't kill , grace . i ca n't kill anybody .

in < u > cash < /u > ?

oh yeah . it 's beautiful , beautiful beaches . blue water and clear skies as far as you can see .

you 're sick too ... he loved to do things to me . control me . my mom ... it tore her up cause she could n't do nothing about it . she become alcoholic ... and the funny thing is -- i liked it . i liked being controlled by jake . the truth was as far out and crazy as he got , i wanted < u > more < /u > . i wanted to go all the way . women say they do n't want to be taken like , < u > really taken < /u > -- that 's bullshit -- they do . the first time he finished with me , he said i was a woman now . i was 14. then he started crying like a baby ... wanted me to hold him . it 's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years , but still want to hold him , comfort him ... they found my mom right down there at the bottom of apache leap . she had cactus needles stuck all over her body and virgil ... sheriff potter said she was drunk and went insane . but i 'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident . she was born on this earth and she loved it . she was like me . she just wanted to fly away .

it 's just such a mess . with jake i mean ...

grace , i 've been fucked over too many times , by too many women . you 're becoming the queen of hot and cold .

what 's the matter ? ... grace ?

is that so bad ? it 's not like i would n't try to make him happy . for awhile , anyway . i mean , i would ... do things for him . i guess i 'm no good that way . i guess i tried to sucker you along like that . do you hate me for it ? i would n't blame you if you did . but maybe it 's like you said : you just got to do whatever it takes to get out .

all this nothing ? it does n't get to jake like it gets to me . he says he do n't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond . more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole .

i take it things did n't much work out the way you planned .

yeah , well i said i was an idiot . whatta you say we get out of here , take a drive somewhere , talk ...

you never did answer my question .

and what would that be ?

nothing like a little liveliness .

like you .

a medicine man ?

where 'd you learn to do that ?

i guess it must .

did you like it ; me watching you ?

i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to .

what happens when you lose ?

i never played tennis . you just travel around bobby -- no direction , no steady work . you must like taking chances .

i do n't know . i have to make a stop in vegas . business to finish . then maybe i 'll head to santa barbara . i might be able to pick up some action there .

where you headed ?

where you coming from ?

not until my car 's fixed . i do n't know how long that 's going to take .

you 're lucky you did n't break down in the desert . day like today , you 'd be dead in no time . when you leaving ?

did n't have a choice . my car overheated up the road .

thank you , bobby .

was n't nothing .

no trouble at all , really .

it 's very nice of you to help me . that package is kind of heavy , and it 's so hot .

you sure you can manage ?

you 're pretty full of yourself , are n't you ?

maybe , but if you did n't i think you would have kept on walking .

harlin 's .

son . little excitement out at the reservation this morning . wayne and dale elkhart were up drinking all night and then wayne starts chasing dale around the desert with his shotgun . bia handled it . i went by for backup .

shit i 'm sorry ! ... you ca n't believe the strain i 'm under . i 'm just under a lot of strain here .

a hundred-forty-five would probably cover it .

but which i can get . no problem . look , i can sell my car in vegas . blue book it 's worth 16 at least . i just need the 150 , uh ...

the old lady ?

no . two of them . two robbers . and they < u > both < /u > get nailed ... get shot by the old lady .

... and let me guess . this robber -- he gets your money .

twenty-seven , fifty . that 's all i got .

30.55. twenty more will get you back .

out of here .

i need a ticket .

sure , i 'll try .

shasta ! now why 'd you go and scare the nice man like that ? sorry about that , mister . let 's see , you want $ 3.25 . you try to have a nice day now , would you ?

i 'll fuckin ' take it . to go .

no beck 's . a-1 , coors ...

you got a beer ?

my lord , that little baby of yours virgil , has gotten cuter ' n a bunny 's nose .

... but i bet the story she < u > did n't < /u > tell you was the best story of all . how old crazy jake < u > was really her papa < /u > . and she < u > liked < /u > fucking papa ! and now she 's killed the sonufabitch ! just like she 's gon na kill you !

well it 's about time . looks like you found yourself a helper too .

like you helped her , jake ?

there 's someone in the house .

oh no ! oh please forgive me , papa !

ya little bitch , you like it do n't you ! you like it this way -- rough and hard . got ta go fuck around on me , like your mama , but you always got ta come home to daddy , do n't you , cause you know daddy 's the best .

nothing , jake . absolutely nothing .

i picked them out for you , jake . i thought you would like the colors .

they look nice .

they look nice .

toby ! toby tucker , leave him alone !

i want my lawyer !

what fuckin grocery store , you fucking shithead idiot ! you call yourself a police ...

what ? you trying to bribe me , mister ? just cause you russians ai n't commies anymore , do n't think money can buy everything ...

you 've made a considerably wise decision .

i had a nightmare one night and i did n't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay . i think that was the first time . does that count ?

my turn . when was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it ?

i did n't know that . mine 's still brown .

rust ?

yeah ? megan where are you calling from ?

the mitchell barbecue three years ago .

... i ca n't remember .

megan , do you ever remember me getting sick ?

i do n't know . it 's been a while .

that 's not what i witnessed david .

okay , i do n't want to play this game anymore .

you 're skill .

i do n't know what you 're asking ?

like what ?

i got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants . like on t.v .

what was your idea elijah ?

your answer to my question . it 's one thing to have never been injured in your life , but to state that you 've never taken ill , well that 's a whole new level .

seventy-five percent .

send him packing . i 'm not walking all the way over there .

he 's got the most beautiful eyes ... the hell kind of question is that ? he 's a guy .

you wo n't get hurt ...

i know now .

all of it .

you put too much . that 's two hundred and fifty pounds .

no .

no .

i 'll help you .

just one --

in under six seconds . i 've heard .

how about your room then ? if you get scared like before , you can come back in here ?

i think it 's be better if i was alone .

he does n't look very threatening .

no .

did you get up from your seat ?

yes . where are the rest of the passengers ?

for a second there i thought you were a fanatic .

... and everyone lived happily ever after .

you and my mother would have a special connection .

how so ?

you just kicked the shit out of a innocent man , you big asshole .

whippin ' ai n't a little thing , alice .

rain 's coming .

we was ... lyin ' .

that kid ... he 's just a ... boy . and that other one , bill , being true to his wife ...

ah , i see .

little bill come out of kansas an ' texas , boys . he worked them tough towns .

maybe he ai n't so tough .

he did n't say nothin ' , huh ?

building his porch !

ha . he was building his fucking porch .

he give 'em names ?

i did n't mean no offense . i guess you 're the one them cowboys cut up . ned an ' the kid , my partners , are they ... ?

some big guy beat the shit out of me . i guess i must look a lot like you , huh ?

i thought ... you was an angel .

i heard that one myself , bob . hell , i even thought i was dead til i found out it was just i was in nebraska . who 's your friend ?

hullo , bob . boys , this here is english bob .

you could run off them two cowboys .

they really got all that money , them whores ?

an ' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to kansas an ' cheyenne ?

she could maybe clean up around the place or somethin ' , but nobody 's gon na pay good money for a cut-up whore .

you figure nobody 'll want to fuck her .

i 'll see you ... in hell , you three fingered asshole .

i do n't ... deserve this ... to die this way . i was ... building a house .

i have done that ... killed women and children ... i have killed most everything that walks or crawls an ' now i have come to kill you , little bill , for what you done to ned . now step aside . boys .

uh , no . no , i ai n't drunk .

i do not like assassins an ' men of low character like your friend english bob ... but bob ai n't no coward who will cry to your face an ' then ...

would n't be no good if it was n't . you got to cock it though .

bam ! that walker colt blew up in his hand ... which was a failing common to that model . now if corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end .

and ?

first off ... corky did n't carry two pistols , though he should of .

letters ?

n-no , sir ?

he said how you was really three fingered jack out of missouri ... an ' bill said `` same three fingered jack that dynamited the rock island and pacific in '69 killin ' women and children an ' all ? '' an ' ned says you done a lot worse than that , said you was more cold blooded than william bonney or clay alisson or the james brothers an ' how if he hurt ned again you was gon na come an ' kill him like you killed a u.s. marshall in '73 .

then ... what ?

a sign on him ?

n-no . he ... he beat him up . he was making him ... answer questions ... and beating him up ... and then ... ned just died . little bill did n't mean to kill him ... he said he was sorry an ' all ... but he said it was a good example anyhow .

little bill . the ... the bar t boys caught him and little bill ...

i was watchin ' you ... seein ' if you was followed .

i 'd rather be blind and ragged than dead , i guess .

i thought you wanted to buy spectacles an ' fancy clothes an ' all .

take a drink , kid .

h-hell yeah . i killed the hell out of him ... three shots ... he was takin ' a sh-sh-shit an ' ... an ' ...

well , that fella today , you shot him alright .

how i said i shot five men ... it was n't true . that mexican ... the one that come at me with a knife ... i busted his leg with a shovel ... i did n't shoot him or nothin ' .

did ... you ... get ... him ?

shut up , kid .

yeah .

he ai n't killed .

what happened ? he ai n't dead ? what 's goin ' on ?

he ai n't dead ? you did n't get him ?

you boys are crotchety as a couple of hens .

say , bill . that business in jackson county ... did that really happen ? i mean how they say it happened ?

well , what were you lookin ' at anyhow ?

i was gon na kill them two by myself . it do n't take three .

well , we was . like you said , i changed my mind an ' ...

if you was to change your mind , might be you could catch me ... due west to the western trail an ' north to ogallala .

do n't tell nobody about the reward an ' all . do n't need no other gunmen tryin ' to collect .

been gone near three years now .

huh ?

jesus !

like i was sayin ' you do n't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer .

i could of ... easy .

claudia ... ai n't here , bill .

his head was all busted open so 's you could see the inside .

you ... you remember eagle hendershot ?

yeah ... you said that last night .

kid ? the kid 's shootin at us ?

no . i mean ... ... an ' get yourself a woman ? you know ?

quincy , he was always watchin ' me . scared .

you ai n't like that no more .

i ai n't blamin ' her , ned , i ai n't holdin ' it against her . she knew me back then ... an ' she seen what a no good sonofabitch i was ... an ' she wo n't allow how i 've changed . she just do n't know how i ai n't like that no more .

well , it ai n't just the bed i 'm gon na miss . i 'm ... hell , billy , i 'm sorry . i did n't mean ...

got used to my bed . ai n't gon na feel to home out here .

we 'll come across him tomorra , i guess .

well , we thought we was doin ' it for money ... what 'd they do anyhow ? cheat at cards , steal some strays , spit on a rich fella ?

easy , huh ? hell , i do n't know that it was all that easy then ... an ' we was young an ' full of beans . bill ... if you was mad at 'em ... if they done you wrong ... i could see shootin ' 'em ...

before i met your maw , god rest her soul , it used to be i was kinda ... wicked ... drinkin ' spirits an ' gettin ' into scrapes an ' all . only she made me see the error of my ways an ' ... i ai n't like i was no more .

all that money ... i mean ... did you ... ?

did i what ?

well , i come back , did n't i ?

only he was n't carryin ' no pistol this time .

tom ?

i guess you lost some hogs to the fever .

hullo , paw .

i ca n't spot 'em myself but you could . that red-haired one , you could spot a half-mile off , i bet .

he would n't of took no beating like that if it had n't of jammed . he would n't just give it over an ' not shoot no one .

how many you killed , kid ?

well , i got ta know what kind of fellas i 'm ridin ' with , do n't i ? in case of a scrape .

say , ned ... ?

fuck you .

i was only checkin ' it for you . thought maybe somethin ' was bent .

well , this here 's ned logan ... ned , this here 's the schofield kid , nephew of pete sothow an ' ...

what was you shootin ' at us for , anyhow ?

keyser soze

and ?

a boy came across a body on the beach this morning . thrown clear when the boat burned . shot once in the head . two guys from the f.b.i . just identified him . +

who ?

they tell me you got the cripple from new york in there . he mention keyser soze

what was the money for ?

i 've been looking all over for you . you still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor ?

jack . what are you doing here ?

& lt ; & lt ; do n't be stupid. & gt ; & gt ;

& lt ; & lt ; are you sure ? & gt ; & gt ;

& lt ; & lt ; i 'll tell you everything . i'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it . just tell this man i want protection . real protection. & gt ; & gt ;

he says they were buying it does n't make sense . i 'm sorry , i 'm a little rusty . they were there to buy something .

edie , please . i do n't want to hear this right now . what did renault and fortier say ?

... and the desk sergeant is actually trying to tell me he ca n't release you ? can you believe that ? you were n't even charged . new york police - jesus . i want to take pictures of your face to bring to the d.a . first thing in the morning .

you 've come far . you 're a good man . i love you .

now remember , this is another kind of business . they do n't earn your respect . you owe it to them . do n't stare them down but do n't look away either . confidence . they are fools not to trust you . that 's the attitude .

a glass of water would be nice .

i hope so , too , mr. kint . can i get you something to drink ?

come on . the guy is a pipe dream . this kobayashi is using him for window dressing .

fuck you . i'11 never shit right again . so who did it ? own up .

everybody i ever worked with , did time with .

we all go . how about it , keaton ?

why you got ta go and do that ? i 'm trying to make a point .

you 're fuckin ' a right , no p.c . well screw p.c . no right . no goddamn right . you do some time , they never let you go . treat me like a criminal , i 'll end up a criminal .

it 's a logistical nightmare . close quarters , no advance layout , ten men , maybe twenty .

dig .

you heard right .

i can run . i got no problem with that .

what if i

i want you to find edie . both of you find some place safe . tell her what happened - everything . she knows people . she 'll know what to do . if we ca n't get kobayashi my way , she 'll get him her way .

russian , i think . i do n't know .

what-are they speaking ?

who 's keyser soze ?

something - i do n't know . i ever tell you about the restaurant i wanted to open ?

we 'll make it .

we 'll make it .

maybe more .

they 're pretty pissed off . they 'll do anything . now i got a way to do it without killing anyone : but like i said , they wo n't let me in without you .

mcmanus wants to go in shooting . i said no way .

what fence ? who ?

mcmanus has a friend in the fourteenth precinct . they 're coming out for one job - thursday . they 're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of south america . fenster and mcmanus have a fence set to take the stuff .

if you 'll just let me -

they 're gon na do a job . three million dollars , maybe more .

you were waiting for a line-up then , too . what happened with that ?

am i ? 92 92 int . hallway - fiftieth floor

neither do we .

mr. so- my employer has made up his mind . he does not change it .

ahh , mr. hockney . do join us .

a strange threat . i can only assume you 're here to kill me anyway . pity about mr. redfoot .

mr. soze made a few calls , yes . you were not to be released until i came to see you . it seems mr. keaton 's attorney , ms. finneran , was a bit too effective in expediting his release . holding the rest of you became a moot point .

my employer wishes to remain anonymous .

who 's your boss ?

tell him we 'll meet .

we want to meet him .

we 're on vacation .

i'11 find him .

no matter . he 'll have to know how close we came .

which is shit .

he wo n't go into the interrogation room .

weapons . misdemeanor two .

where are you going to go , verbal ? you gon na run ? turn states evidence . you might never see trial . if somebody wants to get you , you know they 'll get you out there .

i 'm not bait . no way . i post today .

i did n't know . i saw him die . i believe he 's dead . christ

it was all keaton . we followed him from the beginning .

no , no , no , no , no .

no .

verbal , he left you behind for a reason . if you all knew soze could find you anywhere , why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat ?

i said i never heard of him .

his own people were selling him to a gang of hungarians . most likely the same hungarians that sate all but wiped out back in turkey . the money was n't there for dope . the hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger soze for them .

i never heard of him .

he was a stool pigeon for the justice department . he swore out a statement to federal marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one keyser soze and had intimate knowledge of his business , including , but not exclusive to , drug trafficking and murder .

but keaton ...

then why did n't you help him ?

i do n't .

i tried , believe me , but keaton would n't have it . it was too far-fetched for him . keaton was a grounded guy . an ex-cop . to a cop , the explanation is never that complicated . it 's always simple . there 's

mcmanus was furious . he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit . that night we got the call .

what happened ?

you 're stalling , verbal .

the quartet is part of the bit about kobayashi . the quartet was in my file , along with every other thing i had done since high school , see ? aliases , middle- men . they knew me better than i did . they knew all of us .

you tell me , agent kujan . if i told you the loch ness monster hired me to hit the harbor , what would you say ?

keaton always said : & quot ; i do n't believe in god , but i 'm afraid of him. & quot ; well i believe in god , and the only thing that scares me is keyser soze .

the d.a . gave me immunity .

oh come on , verbal . who do you think you 're talking to ? you really expect me to believe he retired ? for a woman ? bullshit . he was using her .

i 'm not a rat .

you know a religious guy named john paul ?

you know a dealer named ruby deemer , verbal ?

sure . and i appreciate that . and i want to help you , agent kujan . i like cops . i would have liked to have been a fed myself but my c.p . was -

you 're joking .

counselor , i will prosecute your client .

my client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings . in exchange , his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible .

abrams ...

i want to settle this thing and be done with it . i do n't want the archdiocese exposed .

four cases in three years ...

nothing that we can do can make that woman well .

that was our insurance company 's recommendation .

... yes . get her on the phone ...

mickey told me to come back to work .

answer affirmatively . simply . keep those answers to three words . you were n't ` part of a group , ' you were her anesthesiologist . is n't that right ?

i was her doctor .

objection , we 've ...

ed concannon .

i did .

sir . yes . when a thing is wrong ... as in this case , i am available . i am seventy-four years old , i am not board-certified . i have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and i know when an injustice has been done .

i 'm on the staff of ...

uh-huh . still practice a lot of medicine ?

i am seventy-four years old .

` methodology and techniques of anesthesiology . ' yes .

what book is that ?

how is that ?

neurology ?

just as you are , sir ...

the document is disallowed , the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of kathy costello regarding the xerox form . it 's unsubstantiated and we ca n't accept a copy in preference to the original ...

... one moment , mr. concannon ...

objection ! this is ri ... expect us to accept a photocopy , we have the original right ...

then , please , which is correct ? you 've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago . four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago ? which is the lie . when were you lying ?

in fact , you 've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury . you 've just sworn to that . is n't that right ?

you said you 're gon na call me up . you did n't call me up . who do you think you are ? who do you think you are ... ?

then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men , to help a girl whose life 's not going to be changed in the least ? you know what code blue means ?

i ... in that small context i would have ... i would have to say 'no . '

it 's my opinion it took him much longer . nine ... ten minutes . there 's too much brain damage .

now , dr. towler 's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes . in your opinion is his estimate correct ?

... what difference would ...

and you wrote that ...

i. yes . it is .

yes . i wrote it .

dr. towler ; page 406 , 'contraindications to general anaesthetic . ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic . ' does that sound familiar ?

thank you ...

... the case with anyone . and i 'll meet you tuesday , and we 'll go over your testimony ...

i understand .

her doctors killed her .

why ?

you 're going to settle out of court ?

yes .

... and you 're going to do that ?

right . who called ?

dr. gruber ...

you know , you 're pushy , fella ...

then why do n't you testify ?

nothing happened .

i 've got nothing to say to you .

mr. concannon ... ?

you are n't going to get a mistrial , boy . we 're going back this afternoon , we 're going to try this case to an end . now you get out of here before i call the bailiff and have you thrown in jail .

galvin , look , many years ago ...

i 'd just like to get to the point , mr. galvin . let 's not waste these people 's time . answer the question , mr. witness . please . would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence ?

yes , mr. galvin ?

i do n't have a week . this case never should have come to trial . you know better . you 're mr. independent . you want to be independent ? be independent now . i 've got no sympathy for you .

... things change .

my client ca n't walk , your honor .

i was held up .

no . at chelsea childcare . okay . look , call me monday , hey ? i 'm late for work .

yes , we know that you do . i have it in my files . that 's at the manhattan health center ...

missus ...

my subscription lapsed three years ago ...

we find that your subscription lapsed ...

this is miss costello ... ?

mr. galvin 's ...

i understand . thank you , my name is galvin . i 'll be at the following number in a half an hour . it 's urgent .

i ca n't guarantee that ...

business hours are over , sir . this is the switch ...

call the a.m.a . to laura ) ... i ca n't talk now . ... tell them you 're dr. somebody ... you have to find this nurse ...

what are you going to do ?

no .

is it over ?

no ... no ...

maybe i 'll tell you later .

you told me so . maybe you 'd get some sympathy . you came to the wrong place .

who told you that ?

you do what you want . you want to leave ... you want to go kill yourself ?

that 's what i am .

that 's not the question . it 's over . do you think that it 's my fault ? if i 'd ... if i 'd ... i never should have taken it . there was no way that i was going to win .

is n't there something you ...

i 've got to work .

what happened ... ?

that 's what i 'm going to try to do .

they might . yes . that 's the point ... is that they might ... you see , the jury wants to believe . they 're all cynics , sure , because they want to believe . i have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case . i 'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve . and every one of them it 's written on their face , ` this is a sham . there is no justice ... ' but in their heart they 're saying , 'maybe ... maybe ... '

i think i will .

the weak , the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them . is n't that the truth ? you want another drink ?

what hotel are you staying at ?

dr. halpern 's taking all his ...

i do n't want a mistrial .

i do n't know .

... four years ago ...

how old are you , how many children ... when did you last eat ...

i think we tried that . the case is over .

d'you find the obstetric nurse ?

i ca n't talk now .

what happened , joey ... ?

mickey : i 'm supposed to meet somebody at o'rourke 's , i ca n't make it .

they still have to take it to a jury .

so what ... ? the best is yet to come . check the tv guide . they got our dr. towler on a panel on gbh on friday : 'the healing hand . the experts speak . '

brindisi versus electric boat .

okay now . cases : smith versus state of michigan .

forget it . you ca n't prove it . sister 's testimony is no good . jury knows we win she gets the cash .

admittance form is wrong .

... he 's a good man ...

they killed her . and they 're trying to buy it ...

i 'm going to help her .

you need my help ... ? you need a goddamn keeper ... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand ? huh ... ? are you nuts ? eh ? are you nuts . what are you going to do , bring her back to life ?

... hey , i do n't need your charity ...

one lousy letter eighteen months ago . . . .i try to throw a fuckin ' case your way ...

i do n't want to leave her . dick ... the , the ... and father laughlin , he said that it was god 's will ...

but what can we do ? she do n't know who 's visiting her ...

what ?

she told me .

i spoke to her , and everything is all right .

these are your initials , ' k.c . ' ?

i used to be a nurse .

mrs. simmonds .

i 've been meaning to come in a long time .

hi .

... everybody . mike says , ` pat , you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer , and then you go in the back and get laid ? ' ` that 's correct . ' mike says , ` pat . have you been in this bar ? ' pat says , ` no , but my sister has ... ' everyone . buy yourself one too .

why did it take that long to get her heartbeat ...

we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes . we were trying to restore her ...

... they start again three minutes earlier ...

but those notations stop ... ... four-and-one-half minutes after deborah ann kaye 's ...

me , too .

before he can get there here comes this federal marshal , and franky 's indicted for jury tampering , they throw him in jail , he 's gon na be disbarred , his life is over . jimmy , gim me another drink . how are you ?

the big boy did ... ?

... and he 's making a billion dollars every minute working for stearns , harrington , and he bought a dog , and everything is rosy . then mr. stearns , he tried to fix a case .

franky ca n't make it . he had an appointment he forgot , he 's going to see you later . i 'm mickey morrissey , we 're supposed to get to know each other .

how do you know all these things she does n't know ?

and when she goes to those places ...

but you knew about this .

yes .

all right . you wo n't know what to look for at first , scottie . even i , who know her so well , can not tell , sometimes , when the change has begun . she looks so lovely and normal ...

we 're going to an opening at the opera tonight . we 'll dine at ernie 's first . which is easier ?

it 's not my line .

watched her come out of the apartment , someone i did n't know ... walking in a different way ... holding her head in a way i did n't know ; and get into her car , and drive out to ... golden gate park . five miles . she sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore , the portals of the past . sat there a long time , not moving ... and i had to leave , to got to the office . that evening , when i came home , i asked what she 'd done all day . she said she 'd driven to golden gate park and sat by the lake . that 's all .

no , it sounds idiotic , i know . and you 're still the hard-headed scot , are n't you ? always were . do you think i 'm making it up ?

i did n't mean to be that rough .

then you 're of no use to me . i 'm sorry i wasted your time . thank you for coming in , scottie .

someone dead .

then ?

i 'd like to have lived here then . the color and excitement ... the power ... the freedom .

and you like it .

interesting business .

how 'd you get into the shipbuilding business , gavin ?

hello ?

she ... went into the bay .

oh , judy ! ! when he had all her money , and the freedom and the power ... he ditched you ? what a shame ! but he knew he was safe . you could n't talk . did n't he give you anything ?

yes !

took no chances , did he ? and when you got there , he pushed her off the tower , was that it ? but you were the one who screamed . why did you scream ?

and she was the one who died . not you . the real wife . you were the copy , you were the counterfeit . was she dead or alive when you got there ?

we 're going up the tower , madeleine .

take me away ...

-- and wanted to go on loving you . '' and i said , `` i wo n't lose you . '' but i did .

i need you .

but why ? why here ?

scottie , why are we here ?

we 're going awfully far .

ca n't you see ?

how does it work ?

scottie !

oh ! you 're supposed to fasten it !

well , after all , it 's `` our place . ''

it should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck . i told them . i told you .

all right . then i 'll do it . because i do n't care about me anymore . i just want you to love me .

the trouble is , i 'm gone now . for you . and i ca n't do anything about it . i want you to love me . if i let you change me , will that do it ? if i do what you tell me , will you love me ?

the color of your hair ...

yes . yes , i do .

i know . because i remind you of her . the one that 's dead . and not even that , very much .

judy , i just want you to look nice . and i know what kind of suit would look well on you .

you want me to dress like her ?

i 'm trying to buy you a suit .

there 's ransohoff 's . nothing but the best . come on .

yes --

no , there . there 's a good one . do you like that ?

why ? because i remind you of someone ? that 's not very complimentary . and nothing would ... happen ...

no .

oh , well , thank very much . but no thanks .

i 'll take care of you .

and what will i live on ? my oil wells in texas ?

tomorrow night ? well --

oh , no ! give me time to change and get fixed up !

because i 'd like to have dinner with you .

just dinner .

then will you for me ?

i want to know who you are .

but before ! where did you live before ! ? !

i told you ! right here !

just a girl , i work at magnin 's --

judy barton .

well ... you do n't look very much like jack the ripper ...

you .

what about ?

do you live here in the hotel ?

no , there are just a few things i want to ask you , and --

is this some kind of gallup poll , or something ?

you believe that i love you ?

madeleine --

where ?

why ?

you ca n't .

i stood alone on the green , searching for something , and i started to walk to the church . but then the darkness closed in , i was alone in the dark , being pulled into darkness , and i fought to wake up ...

go on with your dream . what was it that frightened you ?

yes ? ! but --

go on .

it was the tower again ... and the bell , and the old spanish village ...

only this far .

no , do n't go away !

do n't leave me ... stay with me ...

i do n't know . an open grave . i stand by the gravestone looking down into it . and it 's my grave .

a grave ...

what else ?

what was it inside that told you to jump ?

no !

have you been here before ?

here with you .

somewhere in here i was born ... and here i died and it was only a moment for you ... you took no notice ...

would you like a drink of water ?

and no birds sing .

knowing i have to die ...

their true name is sequoia sempervirens : always green , ever- living .

of course not ! i 'm a wanderer ! i 'd like to go somewhere i 've never been !

no ... no , i do n't think that 's necessarily true .

wander separately ? ah , but only one is a wanderer . two , together , are always going somewhere .

oh , yes , i forgot : it 's your occupation , is n't it ?

no .

good-bye .

i could n't mail it ; i did n't know your address . but i had a landmark . i remembered coit tower and it led me straight to you .

no ! no , thank you !

i enjoyed talking to you .

oh , yes ! the whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you !

you 've nothing to apologize for .

i ... suddenly felt such a fool .

oh ! yes . hello .

no , you are right , i 'm glad you did n't take me home ... i would n't have known you , to thank you ... oh , but i do n't know you ! and you do n't know me ! my name is madeleine elster .

i ... did n't know where you lived .

you like it , too .

you 're not . merely direct . what were you doing there ? at old fort point ?

because i love it so . it 's beautiful there . especially at sunset . ah ... thank you for the fire .

where were you ?

oh , of course i remember that ! but then i must have had a dizzy spell , and fainted !

you do n't remember .

would you please go and look ?

oh , it must be two weeks . yes , the rent 's due tomorrow .

yes , that 's it . sweet name , is n't it ? foreign . but sweet .

valdes . miss valdes . it 's spanish , you know .

oh , yes !

is there something i can do for you ?

good . i 've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department .

well , i detected an undercurrent .

what was this desperate urge to see me ?

since i stopped being able to get them on the phone . for a man who has nothing to do , you 're certainly a busy little bee . where do you go , these days ?

think ? well , what do you think ?

out . i 've got things to do .

do you know him well ?

pop leibel .

okay .

how ?

i think i can lick it .

what .

are n't you ever going to get married ?

normal .

well , you 've got it . and there 's no losing it . and there 's no one to blame . so why quit ?

johnny , the doctors explained --

it was n't your fault .

you sound so disapproving , midge .

more than you think .

well , you know those police department doctors : no sense of style . ah , tomorrow !

how ?

she died .

well , if it 's absolutely necessary ...

how soon can it be altered ?

i thought so !

yes ! that 's it !

excellent .

the stripper 's here .

i did n't hear you .

do n't you fucking threaten me - i 'll fucking kill you .

do n't you threaten me you little rat fuck .

and you 're a little fucking reject .

fucking boyd . that fucking idiot . they 're on to us .

i have plenty of friends .

she 's dead .

franco mother-fucking harris !

you 're an asshole adam .

boyd brought up divorce statistics .

because my opinion threatens yours , it 's poorly developed ?

sorry fish .

i do n't give a damn .

nobody 's smoking anybody out .

they 're on me . they 're smoking me out !

that is absolutely not true .

no we 're not . the bodies are all mixed up . we ca n't do this to them .

how do you figure ?

we 've already done this .

so i did n't fucking do it !

sure , why not .

there 's more .

stop it !

stop it ! listen to me . let 's just take a second here and take hold of the situation , ok ? let 's just review our options here .

her head 's bashed in and her heart is n't beating .

i 'm calling the ambulance .

what are you doing ?

she 's got no fucking pulse .

one idea that if you had fucking listened to , you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars .

do n't even start .

there is no candy !

they 're screaming like monsters and it 's giving me a headache . go get some fucking starbursts .

they 're singing .

i got you .

i got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull , mike tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack ...

i do n't think so .

what happened ? oh my god ...

i know ...

if anything ever happens to me ...

do n't eyeball your kids .

then fuck what your father said , cause i 'm gon na tell you right now ... you 'll know what it 's all about , why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning , and the streetlight 's coming through the window and it 's just catching a corner of her face , like a sleeping angel . and her hair smells sweet and she 's your 's . she 's all your 's . do you see where i 'm going here ?

no . i think it 's fucked .

right ! that 's exactly what i 'm saying . my father said , first of all , i 'm your father not your friend . i 'm your father .

no ... we want padded chairs ... okay ?

that 's one idea .

i know you 'll be . three hours .

and a house . valued at 350 thousand .

do n't sweet lip me .

sin city . devil 's playground . the black bitch . all day every day . where 's tina ?

who ?

she 's here . she 's just ... hold on a second .

i 'm with tina . is she there ?

what ?

your investment ideas never work out .

you 've got a warped thought process . your brain does n't function properly .

i 'm getting really tired of your bullshit .

good deal . lois just wants to hear it from micheal .

i 'm talking about lois having relaxed her anxiety . only deal is ... you still got micheal there ?

you got a nasty side to your thought process .

i do n't think that 's such a good idea .

boyd ... what have we done ?

ok. definitely not cool ! definitely inappropriate behavior here .

that is a load of shit . personal power has nothing to do with any of this . tony robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly , yes , but to give him credit for this , for all of this ... well that 's just more than the man deserves .

what 's insane is the fact that micheal here put a fucking girl 's head through a toilet . that 's insane .

well we can definitely call the police . that 's an easy call . if we call the police ... what happens ? they find a dead prostitute in the bathroom ... they ask us ... what happened ? we say , ah ... our friend , micheal ... your brother ... got a little out of control ... they were making love ... and he got a little excited ... and he , ah , sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet , while he choked her to death with a rubber hose ...

call 911 .

she 's dead . call somebody !

not really . yes , the fisher wedding chairs ...

okay micheal , let 's go . upsy daisy big guy .

stop it !

we 're goosed ! goosed by god !

we 're not goosed .

he must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share . before the clock runs out .

that 's what i 'm saying . let the israelis straighten it up . they got plenty of room down there , number one . plus , and this is just a plus , they kind of look alike - the jews and the mexicans . so i think on a whole your average joe mexican is gon na have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing . am i right ?

lock up the chickens , dig up the holy dirt , pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long , stick it all on a big fucking tug boat . the whole country picks up and takes mexico .

what ?

then what do they have ?

new king .

you have a king fantasy .

your ideas never work out .

these rings represent the commitment fisher and liz make to each other on the day . fisher do you take liz to be your beloved wife , to respect , honor and cherish till death do you part ?

yea ... it 's great ... seems like ... i do n't know you 've got all the important stuff in there .

do you love me ? do you love me ? !

you put him down or do n't bother coming back .

no ...

i ... liz ... all i ever wanted , was for you to be happy . i just wanted to give you the wedding , the life you always dreamed of ... ... i just love you so much ... so much ...

like if something happened to him , he could still get us .

what money ?

i told boyd two fucking minutes !

no buts . i told you your friends were jackasses .

stop ! you stop right here . i do n't want to know anymore . i told you not to do this bachelor party thing . you were warned .

she 's not alone ... she 's ... boyd ... oh god ... he 's gone nuts ... he killed lois and micheal ... it 's all ...

she 's in the desert . she 's out in the desert .

micheal , by accident .

what are you talking about ?

no it 's not okay . it 's not .

yes .

no .

okay . okay .

do n't we already have someone to do that for us ?

no one 's discussing it . i 'm just gon na run micheal home . i 'll be right back .

we 're not canceling .

lois is a mess and micheal 's really upset . everyone 's upset .

everything 's ok. just some more preparations .

now ?

yeah . sure .

`` darli ... ing you , ewe ewe ewe , send me , darli ... ing you , ewe ewe ewe , mend me .

then you 'd better work on it in the car . we got ta go see the judge .

what 's the word on the chairs ?

i left a message . i think it 's going to be okay .

where are you ?

hello .

i 'm mad at you .

nesting ?

have a nice bachelor party .

i love you .

just call and let me know that your okay .

we 're leaving from adam 's . come send me off .

do you love me ?

go down where ?

not padded ones .

seating problems .

kiss me ... ?

how much ?

of course .

i am not common keith . i am not common . i am a creature like no other and i will not be commoned ! is that to much to ask ? is that to much to ask ! ? !

he 's weird . and i expect more from you .

he 's weird .

i just think that at some point you 're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships ...

i 'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with ... about growing up , assuming responsibility of yourself .

he 's a moron .

it 's a bachelor party . you sort of have to do it before the wedding .

i would n't know .

i 'm working my ass off here . i 've taken care of absolutely everything keith .

how could i know what else i forgot ?

i think so .

photographer ?

i sent a lot of checks , i 'm not sure what all of them are .

why is this kid staring at me ?

harry chaplin . `` cats in the cradle . ''

you did all right dad .

what is it ?

i 've been looking for that flash and i look and i look and i ca n't find it . and what if i already had it ? you know . my moment ? what if it 's gone ? and i never saw it ? you 're getting married , man . that 's a fucking beautiful thing . just a beautiful thing . i just ca n't stop breaking beautiful things .

i think so .

yeah . i got some kind of buzzing . like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull .

that 's what i 'm thinking .

i think there 's a lot of truth in that . i 'm gon na pursue some options . i want to join that big brother thing .

there .

that 's right , `` pup corn . '' doggie treats . little snacks for dogs . he 's figured it out . there is a hole in the market and he 's going to fill it . spends all our money , works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up . after fifteen months , the big day arrives , the first box of `` pup corn '' pops off the belt . he comes running home with that box , pulls us out of school . we all pile into the living room , must be fifty of us , and in comes `` shelmer , '' our 8 year old mutt . `` here shelmer , '' my dad cries . he 's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand , `` here girl . '' this dog will eat anything , she eats rocks , anything . she walk 's up to my dad 's hand , looks down at the little pellet , licks it once , turns around , walks out of the room . shelmer rejected the `` pup corn . '' fifteen months of my dad 's life , right there . not one dog ate pup corn . not one . three months later , `` pup corn '' shuts down . chapter eleven . my father never got over it . never .

downstairs in the closet .

greenpeace ?

greenpeace .

i have no idea .

did she believe you ?

i got to agree with that .

that ought to be about the end of that .

we do n't think so . i mean , we just want the singing when i come out .

... we will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours , no matter how low , how vile ...

it 's a present from my parents .

you 'd like me to kill them ?

no , i do n't want to because they yell . and i 've got news for you too .

no , the children sleep with me .

they 're playing games behind the couch ...

lots . it 's got balconies and two big towers .

so much the better . we 'll all fit . how many floors are there ?

go away ! leave me alone .

you must be out of your mind . i 've been so happy these last few days -- now you 've spoiled it all .

it 's my fault . if i 'd come to see you more often , if i 'd invited you here for holidays , maybe everything would be different .

if you only knew ... when i was young i was full of idealism . i wanted to do something on a big scale for others , something to show my great love for humanity . but as soon as i tried to do something about it , i became afraid that i would be laughed at and i felt like a fool ... and so i went back into my shell .

you must think i 'm mad .

i do n't like masquerading , but as you see i decided to give in to your whim .

sometimes these things happen because of inexperience . sometimes it 's because of ...

how could anybody behave like that ?

oh , some years ago i heard my mother talking about it . but is it true ?

how did you know about that ?

only because you want it .

you are spoiling me too much . i wo n't know what to do with myself when you 've gone .

you see , even the voice .

how like your aunt you are , even in your walk .

my maid ramona 's daughter . she 's a little animal .

who is she ?

was that difficult to get ?

i 'm well ... the bus was late , was n't it ? ... what was the journey like ?

it 's only that ... it 's all very odd , sir .

you believe me , do n't you ?

but sir , what can i say to her ? and why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her ?

just say the word , sir , and i 'll do anything .

what 's the matter ?

enedina 's going to take a picture . so we 'll have a souvenir .

is it all right ?

she wo n't even know .

have you thought of what you want planted yet ?

quiet , my dove . quiet , or i 'll ...

ramona ! ramona !

how in hell does it wind up ?

should n't i be ? you , on the other hand ...

run and get something to mop it up with , quickly .

nothing .

kill him .

kill him and i 'll tell you . if i do n't keep my word , you can kill me too . there are thousands of pesetas . kill him , idiot !

if you free me , you 'll be a rich man ...

you would n't be here otherwise .

i do n't know ; i ca n't remember . but i 'm sure he loved you .

one should n't be alone the whole time . i 'm not like him , am i ?

why did he kill himself ?

no .

i 'll be ready .

you wo n't get much done with those people . those times are over ! you ought to let me kick them out .

i 'm not like you , you have your wife .

it 's about time we spoke to each other , is n't it ?

i was n't thinking of selling him , but if you want ... i 'll leave it to you .

how much do you want for him ?

he 's lying through his ass !

do n't say that .

hold your arm out . you ca n't hope to be cured quickly . you heard what the doctor said . if it had been seen to in time ... this 'll take time . but with the help of god , we 'll pull through .

i 'll take him to the doctor tomorrow . come on now , sit down and go on eating . and you , look after him as if he were a sick brother . be understanding . now finish eating and then go to bed . everyone in bed by eight o'clock !

they told me it is n't at the hospital .

you can not leave ...

how do you do , miss viridiana !

he could n't get through the door , then ?

it 's a very big one .

you have decided to leave , moncho .

this louse is looking for trouble .

what 's going on , moncho ?

you are forgiven . goodbye .

i have nothing to reproach myself for . all i know is that i 've changed . with all my strength , which is not much , i will follow the road that the lord has shown me . one can also serve outside a convent .

is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows ? there must be something .

mother .

good morning . you were n't expecting me , were you ?

i have no desire to see the world again , but if you order me to ...

but why does he want to see me ? he has never bothered about me .

i do n't want to leave the convent , mother .

i 've just had a letter from your uncle . he wo n't be able to come when you take your vows .

mother ?

ask the priest , miss .

what about you , manuel ?

oh , you slept well ; do n't worry .

have i slept long ?

what happened to me ?

could i trouble you for my glass of milk ?

hello .

i 've discovered something about lindenmeyer ' 5 maestro teaching tool i thought you should know ... the harm done to the music students who used the device it was not by accident . the machine was designed explicitly for that purpose . lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it .

i 'm sorry , i thought you were somebody else .

me ? what did i do ?

you already have staked your reputation . mayor bennett and i have been friends a long time . since grimes tried to kill him , it does n't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that sid 6.7 might go after him , too . bennett 's re-election rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose . the fail-safe online , yet ?

there 's already a task force out looking for lindenmeyer . every other officer in the city will be hunting sid right along with you .

we do n't know how , but sid 6.7 made himself into an android .

why was n't i told ?

when this is over , will you get this goddam thing out of my head ?

then i guess we 're even .

do n't worry , they have no idea where you are .

officers in toluca lake just found an affluent couple ... completely gutted . so were the first two cops to arrive on scene .

fine you want to stay here ?

this is the personnel file on the programmer , lindenmeyer . there might be something in it you can use .

these were taken inside letac an hour ago . pretty pictures , are n't they ?

parker barnes , i 'd like you to meet crime czar elizabeth deane .

you were supposed to act as if everything was real .

i do n't set policy . you have the key ?

there is no way parker killed those guards . no way .

captain , i 'm afraid of how smart sid 6.7 is . but i 'm even more afraid of what 's he 's becoming .

you think he 's smart ?

i 'm not sure . my guess is that 's what sid wants us to think .

that 's also where mr. barnes lost his arms to mathew grimes ' booby trap . what 's your point , dr. carter ?

demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel . i do n't know where ...

how do you know i wo n't run ?

i watched your simulation , mr. barnes . very impressive . you know , you 're the only one to ever go up against sid 6.7 who is still alive .

what did cox pull him out early for ?

he hears ... everything .

of the six prison inmates you 've tested all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only mr. barnes is still breathing .

what i need is a nymphomaniac .

i know . i 'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile . if you want to experience the future , meet me in my office in 15 minutes . and bring the sheila 3.2 character module with you ...

how do you kill it ?

hey ! ! !

if i do n't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving , he wo n't be able to walk when i take him out of vr .

turn it down !

i wonder how that ...

glad to ...

sid no ! ! !

you catching my drift ?

which god would that be , the one who created me , or the one who created you ? in your world , the lord giveth , and the lord taketh away . but in my world , the one who gave me life does n't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away .

my god ...

i could n't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty . i 'm a triple-twisting , double back flip off the high platform , not a swan dive .

did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away ?

what do we do now ?

my guess is dead .

you do n't know ?

find out anything ?

that , or living through him ...

if we find sid , lindenmeyer wo n't be far behind .

part of him is .

i told you before , grimes liked to be obvious .

i was wrong . and i was wrong not to tell you grimes was part of sid . i should have told you . i wo n't make the same mistake again .

i pose an unacceptable danger to the public , remember ?

sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards . he suggested i kill you rather than him .

how did you find out about the toxin ?

you knew the entire time ? can you give me one good reason why i should n't kill you right now ?

grimes is back ! he 's back ! he 's come back ! ! !

parker - stop ! stop ! do n't make me shoot you

you like baseball ?

start of what ?

what 's the problem ?

enjoying yourself ?

this is my area of expertise .

then why do n't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while ?

now that he 's in the real world , there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality . sid is going to evolve .

you should practice lying more often . you 're awful at it . where to ?

why did n't you tell me you had a daughter ?

how did you get your hand out ?

told you i was n't going to go anywhere .

and i 'm going to make sure of it . give me your wrist .

give me your wrist .

in order to find him , we have to understand what makes him tick ...

remember the bowling ball bag sid carried with him in virtual reality ?

lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain .

hamlet . what 's david berkowitz got to do with sid 6.7 ?

who said that ?

just like they figured there was no better person to catch one ...

this lindenmeyer 's a real piece of work .

what are you doing ?

i know who would know .

whoever did this wanted to do charlie one better to improve upon what was already done .

he was reenacting charles manson 's labianca murders .

it was n't a lie .

what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy ?

that 's not true , parker .

you 're not my therapist . you 're hear to study me . face it i 'm nothing more than a lab rat to you .

thank-you , daryl . you had me going for quite a while there , sport .

i 've got some final preparations to take care of checking his watch , he stops suddenly .

let me put it to you this way ... whether i 'm here ... or whether i 'm not ... i 'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night .

dead ! you hear me ?

grimes , you 're dead !

as long as they keep overpaying me , i 'll keep overpaying you . ) just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month .

and , to hold it together , i need two days . there < u > is < /u > no b-2 bomber : here 's what you do ahout that : whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the post , lets it slip , `` geez , i hope this does n't screw up the b-2 program ... '' `` what b-2 program , and why should it screw it up ? '' `` if the president moves to deploy the b-2 before it is fully tested . '' `` deploy the b-2 , < u > why < /u > ? '' `` in the crisis . ''

hello , natalie , you recognize the voice ? i 'll give you a hint , you 're thinking seriously about marrying me ...

they wo n't . that 's not their jurisdiction .

wherever you like , lutece , 21 , the river cafe ... or maybe we can just drive around for a while . work up an appetite .

more money than you ever dreamed , roger . and the thing is no one gets hurt ... how bout a beer ?

... i ca n't make it tonight .

if these people lose their jobs , nowhere to go . my father worked at bluestar for twenty-four years . i gave 'em my word .

because it 's wreckable . i took another look and i changed my mind .

why do you need to wreck this company ?

what the hell do you want ?

i 'm sorry , this ca n't wait .

alright ... susan , get buckingham on the box . i want him to look at it . and tell jock taylor at thwick , jensen ... so sport , the falcon has heard the falconer ... tell me more ...

yeah are n't you forgetting something gordon : rule one , capital reserves . this company has $ 75 million cash in an overfunded pension . that buys us a lot of credibility ... ... and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker ...

you do n't understand . i want to be surprised ... astonish me , sport , new info , do n't care where or how you get it , just get it ... my wife tells me you put a move on darien . here 's some inside info for you . that euroflash gq guy she 's going with 's got big bucks but he 's putting her feet to sleep . exit visas are imminent . so do n't lose your place in line . oh , jeez , i wish you could see this . the lights coming up over the water . i 've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment . ... an old russian proverb - `` a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar . '' i like you sport , i ever tell you that ... gordon , call me gordon from now on .

mr. gekko , i 'm there for you 110 % .

you 're learning , sport ...

sorry , mr. gekko .

you 're walking between the raindrops kid . i expect sir larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now .

do n't expect to get it all , sport , you 'll burn out . first rule of business is never get emotional about stock , clouds the judgment . where do we stand ?

what about hard work ?

inside information . oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline ? or someone overhears me saying i 'm gon na buy teldar paper ? or the chairman of the board of xyz suddenly knows it 's time to blow out xyz . you mean that ? i 'm afraid sport , unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company , you and i are gon na have a hard time doing any business ...

'course . larry wildman . one of the first raiders .

nice club , mr. gekko ...

mr. gekko , i do n't think i can ... go on .

nice to see you again mr. gekko .

my home number 's on the back ...

how do you know ?

... do n't like airlines , lousy unions ...

it 's a dog , what else you got , sport , besides connections at the airport ?

ca n't tell you that , mr. gekko .

i figure a guy who 's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who 's made some of her own ...

hi .

are you mad ! why are you doing this ! we 're so close , the town is going to be ours . do n't throw away your future bud !

talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped . i handed it to him on a silver platter . i told my father and those people ...

sure , why not , money 's the sex of the 80 's . i never had it like you when i was growing up , baby , it was n't the upper east side .

... are you going to trade all night again ? you got to go to work in a couple of hours .

it 's not me i 'm worried about ... you know darien , the only reason we have n't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left . you owe me , i want you , what else is there ... but you , me , the world . ... right here ... make love to me ... now ... stop me if i 'm going too far .

i 'll bet he 's got an opinion on the stock market too . this apartment is already ahead of its time . i call it the `` demolished '' look . they 've already heard about it at house and garden and they 're coming next week to photograph it before it gets ... lived in . is that alright ? i 'd love to have it in my portfolio .

and what do you want ?

how would i know ? i once bet a horse . he went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five .

you may call me a yuppie ... it 's mister yuppie to you .

upper west side .

you got it , a great spender of other people 's money .

oh really ? well , i guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye , because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last june .

i 'd give anything to have this in my house , even for a week .

stock broker . as in : never have so few done so little for so much . so what do you see in this ?

destiny took us apart , but i knew it would bring us back together .

grand marnier . a romantic and tragic drink .

oh christ !

... janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps , urgent ...

how you doing buddy ?

you 're on a roll kiddo . enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does .

sleep with me and the secrets of the west are yours .

no , it 's a prophecy . the rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time . the only difference between the pyramids and the empire state building is that the egyptians did n't have unions . i know what this guy is about -- greed -- he 's in and out for the buck and he do n't take prisoners . he do n't give a damn about northstar or us ...

come on , we both like buddy . but this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top ... it does n't fit .

it 's over you , gordon .

those days are over , gordon . they were over a long time ago .

the same interest as yours larry . money . i thought it 'd be a good investment for my kid ...

rarest pistol in the world , larry , a .45 luger . only six were ever manufactured .

cause i have a way around all this , a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again . what do you say we cut to the chase . i 'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut .

doctor ? lawyer ? china lawyer , doctor , i do n't care .

businessman ?

he did ?

he still likes you

china . what happened ? china shhh . it 's ok. i missed you so much .

your books master loftmore

i hope you enjoyed your visit .

china

well , it all started when a friend and i

who 's is all this ?

then why do you still like her ?

i 've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that .

this time i really do n't see anyone man .

anyone else not coming ?

come on mark mark ah hell , why not . i 'll get the maid to write the essays

you bet . we all ca n't be such modern people

stop saying things so loud !

someone crying . a girl . i thought i was crazy .

a ghost ?

i know he does .

that 's not true .

i 'm just saying , you 're going to be fine .

of course you will .

hey .

me ? no . well , in the accident i was injured , but ...

i felt ... pain . that she 'd been hurt by someone . this is great . i 'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my --

your friend saw them .

these are good .

no .

who 's that ?

no . i 'm just not sure what you mean .

i 'm sorry ?

norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished .

give me that shit . your wife .

oh-kay ...

this really is n't a good time .

yes ?

you must think i 'm pathetic .

and these roses . they 're much prettier up close .

thank you .

very much .

for scaring you like i did . when i thought about what that must have seemed like that day ...

i 've never even met you .

how ? how can you help me ? with your flowers and your perfect life ...

it 's mrs ... it 's claire ... spencer . from next door . is everything --

you must have been very proud .

full scholarships . princeton too . she wanted to stay close .

i do n't know .

why are you here ?

she never mentioned her father .

you look a little old for a student .

she never mentioned you .

she got it . turned it down .

you should have heard her play .

i came in from my room ...

we know each other .

wow .

trust me , claire . you hear something ... change the subject . you find something ... get rid of it , throw it in the lake . you know what happened . the rest is only details . and no one 's ever glad they got a hold of those . if you want to put this back together ... just let it go .

what is it ?

alight , alright . stay calm . you opened this door . there 's got to be a way that you can close it .

that could take days . i need to do something now . do n't you see ? she wants us dead .

we need help . please let me call the medium .

she could have hurt me if she wanted to .

i do n't know .

all of us .

by the time i finally got up the nerve to tell you , stan called from the hospital and it was too late .

i had just been left by richard . i was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason , it made me feel better that your life was n't as perfect as it seemed .

relieved ?

and he 's the real thing . specializes in cases like this , like yours .

hartford ?

jody , she 's alive .

it 's alright .

jody , wait .

i have to go .

place your fingers on the planchette .

no , you 're not . but a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly .

i do n't ...

please . that 's all i need .

telling you ...

it 's niiice .

yep .

oh my god . you bought it .

thanks , but i 'm fine .

okay , i 'm a little tender .

why does everyone find that so surprising ?

mauduh ...

okay . do n't ... you do n't understand what this is .

she 's out there is n't she ? she 's in the lake .

maybe we can stop there for lunch .

how can you be sure ?

she ca n't be here without me .

she 's gone .

she was damaged and unstable . the more i tried to distance myself , the more desperate she became . finally , she showed up at the new house ...

to caitlin ! !

that 's not true ! you wanted to quit ! and then when you did , you hated me for it ... so you gave it all to her .

i never asked you to quit !

claire , please do n't ...

i snuck back to my car , trying to convince myself it never happened . and when i woke up in the hospital ... somehow it had n't . until now .

i was there .

why do n't you shut up and fuck me , professor .

i do n't like this , this ...

it 's too rough .

... please stop ...

stop ...

no . i 'm afraid to ask what this is about .

in the living room ...

when she said it , there was something familiar ... but no .

good . you sat in front ... i saw you there ...

yep .

do i have everything ?

... i 'm pulling up , yuri . i 'll see you for dinner . sure you wo n't stay ?

norman , this is n't about you . this is something that 's happening to me . it 's not to get even ... and it 's not some warped bid for attention . some strange things are happening in our house , whether you believe in them or not ...

this is the feur thing ?

norman ...

i know i 'm not at the center of the bridge .

you 're not at the center .

dinner . with stan and his new girl .

she could be out . she could be sick in bed for all we know .

it 's a ghost .

it 's her ! i 'm telling you . she whispered and turned on the music . she 's trying to contact me !

it 's a flare .

sorry . you understand .

what ? no . no .

`` ... for my father . ''

oh , no ...

yep .

think i may have cracked it .

no . can you drive me home ? i 'll bring you back in the morning .

what do you mean ? some noises where ?

there were some noises . i did n't want to disturb you .

no , no . it 's fine .

hi .

is it gone ?

... when tonight they 'll probably be keeping us awake .

why ?

after that .

maybe we should just ...

it 's just us now .

to get my life back . to have some time for myself . some time for us .

fine .

how are you ?

how is it ?

what 's their name ?

i think three ...

but it does n't make sense . they - they used lasher ... they conspired with him .

two heartbeats .

there are two .

lasher will act , rowan . whatever it is he wants - he 's waited three hundred years to have it . facing him alone ... i do n't like -

i 've grown very fond of you you and michael both .

then what is he ... ?

every day twice .

i 'll probably be back in a week ... but i ca n't spend christmas in that house . you 'll check on her - every day ... ?

then tell me . is it lasher ... .

rowan .

i - r saw him as a child . lots of times ... but no one else did .

if i could feel like you feel ... but i have only others ' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me . things to be felt , yes -- - but not nine to feel ...

ro , how long have we known each other .

i 'm soon to be a very wealthy witch .

listen . last night - oh christ , this'1l take forever to explain . god , michael ...

michael ! jesus i 've been trying -

god knows , i 'm intriguing .

i called dr. styles at the neurological institute in l.a. , remember ... ? he said he 'd see you . he was intrigned .

i 'm serious . you do n't -

you do n't know what you meant - because you do n't know me .

just sit there and soak up the vitamin d .

it 's come to that , huh ... ? three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life ... ?

he 's very pleased with your response to the surroundings .

my mother and i used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside . the queen 's house- . the gangster 's house- . the clown 's house- like that .

my uncle . graham . he and my aunt , ellie raised me . he - he - had a stroke- just before ellie died - of cancer . last year .

yessssss ...

harder ...

do they keep everything 'out ' ... ?

'freak at the week . ' that 's what the tv crew . call it- people come right to the house . they have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid- they bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it . so i can teel them where they are..

you okay ... ?

that 's a wasp . fuckers 'll sting a tree if they 're bored- so - where is she ... ?

bullshit ! let me in ! mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont .

i thought it was 'whistle while you work .

i 've decided not to open a practice here i want to set up a research clinic . for infant genetic disorder .

i thought someone was following me - i - er - i just needed my computer and some things ... listen , i 'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that ok ?

i thought you were someone else

i 've got a tenant coming over later - can i take the afternoon off ?

no - i 've been abroad for a long time ...

i loved you ellen - why did you do this ?

wait for what ! ?

i have n't been using it recently leslie

i am sorry ...

psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons

i want it to stop - it all to stop ...

my sister - my adopted sister -

stephanie ?

no ... i did n't do it ... i wish i had but i did n't . i was beaten to it . stephanie became my mother .

tell me about your adopted mother

why not ? please - it would help me

tell me how it happened ...

why should i feel sorry - they 're dead .

what did you do with her ?

did n't debbie deserve anymore ?

because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses , but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts ... society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she does n't deserve any more -

where do you kill them ...

no - the police say i 've killed fourteen - but i 've not - i 've killed many more . it amazes me how they just have n't found the bodies . what is society coming to when people just do n't get missed . i agree , some of them are well hidden - i probably could n't even show you where i put them - one girl , number eight i think the press called it - she was n't even mine - i do n't know who did it but i did n't

you do n't know ?

yes , one and a half please .

do n't worry - is that my hammer well just make sure that it 's put back in the garage ...

what 's with all the locks - and hammering

the touch ?

i lost the touch

is leslie here ?

i would prefer it if you kept away from leslie

at 2.00 ...

i 'm sorry , i could n't - when is she due ?

i 'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - it 's best if we let old bones lie . know what i mean ? i 'm working on the white angel case now - and i 've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years ... and that means you ... so where were you last thursday afternoon around five ...

what 's this all about ?

i 'd really like it if you would come round some time - then i could cook you a meal - what do you say ...

no - a dentist

dead ?

holy stinkers , what were you thinking ?

hell yes , all hundred and seventeen of 'em !

a couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he 's seen .

give me those !

oh , how inappropriate is that !

... where they get all the really good porno channels on cable .

beauty ? no . we 're talking goddess .

i better go , dad .

perv .

and like every hamburger guy knows , when you get your one big chance at the good life , you abuse every second of it until they figure out you do n't belong there and kick your sorry ass out .

for a guy about to try his first dom perignon , you are extremely uptight .

astronomical .

what are the odds of there being another ted nelson on our flight ?

nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation .

poor freud , turning in his grave .

think about it ... long tunnel , bright lights , it 's full of vaginal symbolism .

she smiles at everyone , ted . she 's like a newborn with gas .

see ? did you see that ?

that vibe is from your wrist , pal . you 've been over-tenderizing your meat , again .

do n't get me wrong . we can salivate over all the christy malones of our lives . wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon . but we 're strictly hamburger guys . ground chuck , sixty eight percent lean , is about the best we can hope for .

we do n't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine . but hey , if you think there 's a market for it .

naked girls , wild sex , video games . no wonder it 's called `` heaven . ''

new hushpuppies do n't make a new man .

oh , teddy bear , you 're funny .

which you pulled , hard !

the answer is never , ted , never . except maybe in your dreams .

oh , ted , duh . i smile at everyone since i got my braces off .

but that smile .

i do n't like you . we 're just friends .

shut up ! are you serious ? of course i will ... of course .

if you do n't have ... i mean ...

ted , we put a lot of love in our business .

oh , honey . we ca n't accept this extravagance .

of course , dumpling . its very nice of ted but ...

shut your pie hole , jimmy .

why do n't you just admit what this is really all about ? i 'm not your real kid and you ca n't control me anymore .

well , good . every little bit helps .

i guess we could go to disneyland or something .

of course we are .

i 'm getting so good at this .

you 're way ahead of me again ?

i guess ... i do n't know ... i guess we should leave if we 're not wanted .

or do you have a taste for the good life , ted ? it 's in your blood .

i 'm ted , by the way . i think i forgot to say that .

they 're in the ignition , silly .

can you believe that was me ?

they kept this scrapbook of your life . it meant the world to them .

no problem , consider it done . i had this idea of shooting on location . outdoors , you know ? maybe at some famous xenia landmarks . you think that would be a problem ?

are they hitting you up for donations ? asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee ?

that 's it ? i mean , you do n't want to order room service or anything ? we could play games and watch movies and stuff .

just a formality .

sheryl petersen is , what , nine years old , what does she know ?

james , what are you doing here ?

why ca n't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little london broil ? i mean , for god 's sake , we own a grocery store !

i know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief .

i graduated from college . did great , summa cum laude and all . and i 'm about to launch a brand new magazine called `` exposed ! '' an homage to miss julie conroy of xenia , ohio .

the thing is , i made a commitment . i said i 'd do it and i have to keep my word .

you 're quick . i like that .

trust is something you earn , over time . you do n't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire .

you live and learn . i realized the most important thing to me , above all , is trust .

i had a portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me .

that 's refreshingly deviant .

you expected whips , chains , merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood ?

let 's do it .

i got an anonymous tip and an address in cincinnati .

he 's on the move ?

you 're amazing .

eventually you 'll let go .

the ozone must be fully depleted on planet ted .

i see .

he did n't . he had it built .

where are we going ?

write what you want . just try not to make it so obvious that you 're crazy about me .

do n't write that part .

me ?

i 'm still better than you . nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account .

ah ha ! it was so well hidden , you did n't even know it was there .

in what sense ?

it 's so nice to have friends like you , christy .

it was for your own good , in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way .

is it true ? is ignorance bliss ?

so , william randolph . your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of rice crispie treats and chocolate snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale .

but who would run the store ?

you do n't have to work another day in your lives .

i 'll make you very proud .

mom . believe me . i could buy all that and the factories they came from .

i do n't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town !

our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking .

what kind of sick question is that ? i 'll be watching you , young man . your money and power mean nothing here . nothing .

i never figured you for a pimp .

you think i ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks ? i do n't want your silly billion dollar empire ?

all is fair in `` heaven , '' ted-baby .

we 've got a huge problem with the magazine , ted-baby . our readers hate it . hate it . we need to talk .

yes ?

my father must 've been amazing .

the world is a big , beautiful place . we can open new markets in africa and asia . imagine the dali lhama reading our magazine .

my parents always say hard work builds character .

i was like a different person tonight .

truth is , i 'm a little nervous .

yeah . everything 's cool .

ah , in other words , this is the apres-orgy salon ?

i 'm seventeen . i know it like the back of my hand .

my parents ? what do you mean ?

i 'm just a messenger .

people pay good money for that ?

i ... you know ... i ...

so , did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life ?

i 'd like that .

what about the blood ?

how soon can we get something ?

and the child ...

gator ca n't see what 's in front of it for shit . they see out the sides . that one do n't even know walter 's arm 's in his mouth .

try , kelly .

they were in me . both places ... you know .

the next thing ... his hand was in my shorts ... you know , from behind . his fingers ... his fingers ...

i know you do .

i do n't know what to say ...

ray , you heard him ...

we do n't know that , ray ...

those are suzie toller 's teeth .

just check out the car .

you have someplace to be ?

ray . we do n't know anything yet . she could be anywhere ...

were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you did n't do what you could to stop it ?

what ? you would n't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter ? cone on . she bought the same story we did ...

so what about the girls ? suzie 's poor , but why would kelly have to steal from her own mother ? surely her father ...

the job looks okay to us . but look at it from his point of view . the man 's surrounded by wealth and privilege . but for him ... it 's just a reminder of what should have been his .

why ? you ask me , lombardo had it pretty good already , nice job in a beautiful setting , popular , an active social life . he 's gon na put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you 're describing ...

i thought of that . then i said , come on , you 're lombardo . your reputation is getting trashed . you want to stop the bleeding . you do n't want to sit in jail for three months . unless ...

you saw the news today ?

the skinny brunette .

it 's our job , gloria .

no .

yeah .

why is that ?

she looked shaky , but lucid . i thought , i would just go with her , stand at the door ... i think i looked away . a split second . then , bingo . just like that . she puts a knee into my groin . there was this coffee table between us and the wall . she got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case . thing had a glass door . i could hear it breaking . i did n't go down , but she slowed me up , just enough . before i could get to her , she 'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun . i yelled at her to put it down . she got off a shot . i took it in the shoulder . i ... i had no choice . i returned fire . two rounds , i think . in the chest .

are you crazy , ray ?

he was my friend at first . then i got busted ... he did n't even stick up for me . i had to go away to that hellhole . it 's like , you 're his favorite , then who cares ? you wan na know something ? when kelly said we should do this , i thought cool , all these big shots screwing me over , like that cop , duquette . now they 're gon na get screwed .

i said he did .

what did you do then ?

what about you , jimbo , you need a ride ?

thank you , jimmy .

no !

come on . beats study hall , does n't it ?

yeah , but ...

i wan na live at the beach someday .

oh , for christ 's sake .

you 're gon na fuck me over , are n't you ?

you can trust me .

you 're out of your mind .

is there some reason why you 're here ?

i 'm here to congratulate my friends and their children . i 'm leaving again tonight .

is that sam lombardo ?

so if they 're tapping your phone , we 're dead . stay in the guest house . skip the graduation parties . you 'll never see duquette . okay ? i love you .

but what if they find out ... god , they 'd put you in the gas chamber ...

duquette . forget him ...

i 'm really serious . that cop , he keeps watching me .

you know what it takes .

kelly . is suzie there ?

how much ?

jesus christ , what are you doing ?

look , kelly ... i 'm sorry ... i know what you 've been through ... i should 've seen something like this coning .

all right . i 'll have to look for it .

rules are rules , mr. lombardo .

jeez , that thing ... ca n't you ...

deal . you know , i just looked out front . my ride was n't there . you suppose you could give me one ?

okay , try me on sunday . i 'm going out to the everglades on saturday . you guys can wash the mud off .

fair enough . let 's go make a statement .

good . so what we 're going to do is march right to hunter 's doorstep . we 're going to insist they take a statement . we 're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back . they 're walking a fine line here . defamation of character , malicious prosecution ...

not in here . chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes .

forget it .

i 'm placing your daughter under arrest .

shut up .

do n't you see what this means ? you really think sam and kelly are gon na give you a third of the money ? you , the pill-head with the rap sheet ?

suzie , suzie ... this is me , ray , you 're talking to . we both know you do n't have shit , never have had shit , never will have shit ...

is that what you think ? you have friends ? is that what they told you ?

you , kelly , sam .

about what ?

that 's cop bullshit .

you got something against cigarettes ?

it 's celine . he 's okay . he had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are .

come off it , man ... it was an accident .

that how you planned it ? you take cut suzie , get me to hang it on kelly , then dump me in the ocean ...

come on , man . i 'll make a sailor out of you yet .

you mean this thing ?

well , shit , you 're the cop , they do n't teach you to disarm people , shoot them in the leg or something ? you were n't supposed to kill her for christ 's sake .

hey , what did you want me to do , die ?

fuck you . this is bullshit . i 'm outta here .

but you do admit to touching her , to putting your arm around her . is n't that against the rules ?

that 's right .

and she began to cry . and you put an arm around her .

but you ca n't tell us what she wanted to talk about .

yes .

and she wanted to talk .

story 's the same , detective ...

i think there 's some things you do , you do n't want to see yourself doing them .

walter . he 's been aimin ' that brownie through knotholes for years . i saw these , i knew he 'd finally struck gold . i ca n't decide which came out better , that little straw kelly 's got up her nose , or that vibrator you 've got up her ass . what do you think , mr. lombardo ?

well , i 'd need the famous lombardo charm , not that you 'd have to do anything you have n't done already .

we ?

yeah , real funny . you 're wrong about this , i could get busted on the spot .

that was about as grim as it gets .

good . just keep telling yourselves that , the only people who can fuck this up is us .

yeah , right .

put kelly on too .

sam ...

did n't you see her this morning ?

listen , kelly skipped school . have you talked to her ?

what ? running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat ...

hi , sandy .

the machine was stopped ! it seemed like a perfect time to disable it ! why 'd you have to throw it into full throttle ? !

my god ! he 's so excessive !

god in heaven , what is that ? !

my hat is off to you , sir .

my disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case . i spent three years on the stage , you know . remind me sometime to regale you with my lear .

damn , i wish this thing would go faster .

sounds like a train . looks like a train .

he 's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named willard .

a cylinder recorder . my own design .

sure . it 's a wind-up ... thing .

so ... what happened ?

well ... that , too .

which is why we 're heading to houston , texas . home of the loveless steam engine works .

at least the thing 's not that fast . we just follow it . whenever it stops , we 're there , waiting .

damn it , this is ridiculous .

at least i tried something .

it 's a repeating steam cannon !

could i just point out , this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention .

garrison ... ? then the president was right . except it 's not a foreign power , it 's a bunch of die- hard rebels trying to make the south rise again .

what was all that back there ?

good , i was n't sure you were up to it .

come on , jim . i 'm serious . dot ... dash . it 'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it .

doctor v. l. pemberton . i knew it . he 's a scientist all right . inventor of the pemberton condensed steam engine . i 'm telling you , artemus , loveless is our man .

aha !

well ... it 's the only one i have . it 's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots ...

your little jack-in-the-box gun . that might be useful .

always hoping . or this ...

sorry . did n't mean that . just a little device of mine ...

eight scientists . eight different fields of endeavor . hydraulics , optics , ballistics ...

if you 're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion , then i for one am fully prepared to do so ... al fresco .

funny , i was just thinking you should do the same . since i am already in residence , and am obviously the man for the job , it 's been grand making your acquaintance , sir . and best of luck in all your future endeavors .

artemus gordon . bach , he 's the composer .

j. s. bach .

like hell ! i 'll see it through ! ram the bastard !

time for you to get off , ma'am .

but it only has six legs .

well , let 's help them with that . take the legs .

they do n't even realize they should be frightened .

i could get used to this , looking down on people .

here . mr. tyler . he claims a certain skill at handling firearms .

a new friend ?

she 's perfectly safe .

i 'm not so sure dr. loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger .

have you taken a wrong turn , mr. tyler ?

my ... the wild west .

well , where i come from it kind of goes with the territory . texas .

i do n't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before .

would you be thinking ... ramming speed , sir ?

that would be correct . orders from the president himself . trans- portation at your beck and call . no delays . although , the government 's generosity takes me a tad by surprise , as well .

private train ?

french ? damn it , i want my own man on this case . somebody i trust . somebody who does n't mind breaking up the furniture !

and ?

goddamnit ! what am i doing ? what 's happened to all my cigars ? colonel richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year . no arrests , no leads , no clues ...

easy ? easy ? on just what grounds should i take it easy ! ?

easy now .

you 're not that big .

... and do give me some room , voltaire . you 're breathing on my head ! i hate it when you breath on my head !

how embarrassing . did i hold up three fingers ?

sir ... i believe you have only two barrels .

now it 's a bomb .

i only met him once , but that was enough . for such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself . he offered me the `` rare and unparalleled opportunity '' to develop a new steam engine for him . he claims to have some sort of factory in texas , i believe . said i could have the run of the place . he had all sorts of specifications . but when i questioned him closely , it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman . both he and his partner had no real love of steam . it 's sad . so few men do .

who were they ? what do they want with me ?

dr. pemberton ?

thought you might get lonely , mad- martigan !

you managed alright .

why ca n't you do it ? you have mag- ical powers .

you are the guardian , willow . you must take her to tir asleen .

you mean , you know who this baby belongs to ?

yes ... ?

i do n't want courage . i do n't want to be a warrior . all i 've ever wanted was to do magic , real magic , like you !

you 're strong enough . but you 're going to need courage , willow .

not today , willow .

i have no family .

i 'm not going to let this baby die .

you 're a fool . now put her back .

too bad you 're not more like your father .

my step-father 's going to tear you apart .

mmmm , i love the smell of a woman .

you 're not a woman .

you ! are you the mother of that child ?

can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress , raziel ?

sorsha , queen bavmorda 's daughter .

who is that girl , anyway ?

i will ! but i need help !

then you get us out of here .

that 's my fault , not hers . i 've got to keep practicing . i 'm still in the learning stage but magic , madmartigan , requires concentration and --

she ca n't be wrong . she 's a very very very powerful sorceress .

willow !

i 'll help you ... !

madmartigan , i need your help .

now willow , i know you 're gon na blame me for this but it was n't my fault ... !

i thought you had her !

i will .

i 'll be around long after you 're dead , airk ! you slime ! when i get outa here i 'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole !

what is it ?

farmer .

as if you care . i saved your life , peck . those guys woulda killed us ! you wan na give your baby to them ? ? they eat babies !

miserable pecks .

what a great son you are , ranon . i wish i could take you with me . now go to sleep ...

absolutely not .

no , it 's too big to be a nelwyn baby . it looks like a daikini ...

surrender ! !

i 've come all this way and now elora dana 's going to die !

you did n't transform them , willow , you released them . that was noth- ing . now change me .

raziel ! i transformed them all ! i 'm a magician !

there 's nobody here .

tir asleen .

i just wanted to test it first .

his will .

we need blood . to nourish the stone . charge the stone with ener- gy .

what 'd you bit me for ! !

shhhhh !

oooh , this smells terrible .

what 's the magician 's weapon ?

patience . concentrate . you will find a way .

i hope she 's all right . how much more do i have to do of this ?

that 's all i ever wanted !

did *you* give that acorn its power ?

we need your help . to take this baby to tir asleen . she 's a prin- cess .

ouch ! let go of me !

elves ! they 're always tormenting babies . they make them cry and take their tears .

she 's hungry .

who is he ?

queen bavmorda transformed her .

its branches are supposed to be made of gold , solid gold .

this is not going well .

why not ?

take your time . do n't worry about the elves . they wo n't come out here .

you 're the guardian , are n't you ?

who ? ?

john , i do n't understand any of this .

put my car in the garage and close the door .

upstairs , asleep . where 'd you think ?

sorry . it 's important .

how could you do this to me tonight ? i told you i had company

try the house .

have you got your gun on now ?

are you really ever coming back ?

do n't let them hurt you .

is it them ?

tell you what i 'm going to let you handle this one . but only if you promise not to say anything to your momma . i 've got a feeling she would n't understand .

you ever handle a pistol like this , samuel ?

who 'd you see ?

i 've already got something worked out . be seeing you .

how bad did mac get you ? we figured pretty bad .

just us .

maybe the bureau . or those bastards at treasury . i 'll take care of it . i hate this shit , johnny . you cut their balls off for me . i 'm counting on you .

okay , what are you going to need to clean it up

i hope you do n't have any doubts about that .

when word gets out that zenovitch was a cop , all hell will break lose . you 've got 24 hours . that 's all i can give you . 24 hours on your own . after that the case and the witness go back to the homicide department .

if there is n't i 've just wasted the last six months .

maybe .

you know who ?

so one of them got to him .

oh , he 's good .

here . whenever you want them .

where 's my baggy pants ?

i want you to take this ... to remember by .

well in the city of philadelphia , god needs a little help !

that 's your way , not mine .

what you do is take vengeance ! which is a sin against heaven !

i was being foolish ?

you should not bother with that birdhouse . if you 're leaving tomorrow .

but ... you may not be well enough .

now hold on . there 's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job .

hochmut ?

your husband 's ?

john book , i would appreciate it if , during the time you are with us , you would have as little to do with samuel as possible .

does anybody know i 'm here ?

no , no doctor ...

but john ... why did n't you go to a hospital ?

stay for awhile . rest . i 'll make coffee and breakfast .

i was wrong .

you said we would be safe in philadelphia .

you could n't wait until morning ?

they kid a lot .

people who do n't go into our courts when they 're told to sometimes go directly into our jail .

whacking ?

you have no right to keep us here .

where i 'm at is maybe 1890 .

i hear you . i 'll stay in touch .

listen , johnny , do n't do anything stupid . you could n't get within a mile of schaeffer right now . so stay put ... stay in touch i 'll let you know when maybe it makes sense .

yeah ... i can put it all together when i get back , 'til then , you know nothing , understand ? business as usual ...

nothing . i 'm not going to be around for a while . i 'll call you when i can .

let 's just find coalmine . listen , zenovich made a mistake . you did n't let anybody down . it happens

i got there late , john .

you 're the first one he 'll contact .

but ... if you had to guess ?

better you should get off my front porch before i get my mace !

did you find him ?

fred . the way he looked when you screamed at him .

good morning .

yes , thank you very much .

i have to help him !

you shame yourself .

that is idle talk .

how can this be ? how can you do such a thing ? is this plain ? is this the ordnung ?

i know god help me , i know that , eli . but i tell you that if he 's found here , the people who did this to him will come for samuel .

is the english dead ?

yes . samuel ! we 're going .

you 're rachel lapp , are n't you ?

never seen anything like that in all my years .

what about carter ?

i do n't want to stay here .

momma ... are they angry with us .

yes , darling .

oh , auntie em -- it 's you !

dorothy . dorothy , dear . it 's aunt em , darling .

now , you just help us out today , and find yourself a place where you wo n't get into any trouble .

oh -- all right .

dorothy ! dorothy ! we 're busy !

seventy -- dorothy , please !

oh , but aunt em , she hit him over the --

fifty-seven , fifty-eight --

oh , i hope we got them in time .

yes .

well , dorothy was walking along the --

look at you , zeke -- you 're just as white --

is morally , ethic'ly

if she ...

yes , sir . so we 'd like you to keep your promise to us , if you please , sir .

please , sir . we 've done what you told us . we 've brought you the broomstick of the wicked witch of the west . we melted her .

oh ! come back ! do n't go without me ! please come back !

no , i 'm afraid it 's true . there 's no other wizard except me .

sure . it 's to break up winds , so we do n't have no more dust storms . can you imagine what it 'll mean to this section of the country ? i 'll show you . it works perfectly now . here 's the principle . you see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky . these air currents -- oh , stop it !

now look , here 's something that really has a heart . this is the best invention i ever invented .

i 'm sorry . i did n't do it ! can i still have my dog ?

all in good time , my little pretty -- all in good time .

no -- no ! it was an accident ! i did n't mean to kill anybody ! ... .

there 's no place like home . there 's no place like home . there 's no place like home . there 's no place like home .

and think to yourself -- `` there 's no place like home ; there 's no place like home ; there 's no place like home . ''

oh , now ?

you do n't need to be helped any longer . you 've always had the power to go back to kansas .

it 's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the yellow brick road .

no -- that 's true . the only person who might know would be the great and wonderful wizard of oz himself !

pooh -- what a smell of sulphur ! i 'm afraid you 've made rather a bad enemy of the wicked witch of the west . the sooner you get out of oz altogether , the safer you 'll sleep , my dear .

but you could n't have been , could you ?

oh , no -- no !

oh --

professor marvel never guesses -- he knows ! now , why are you running away ?

stop her !

here ! i 've got an order ! let me have ...

oh -- goodbye , lion . you know , i know it is n't right , but i 'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage .

now i know i 've got a heart -- 'cause it 's breaking .

yes ... !

do n't you know the wizard 's going to give you some courage ?

oh --

ca n't that female take no for an answer ?

still , i wish i could remember . but , i guess it does n't matter anyway . we know each other now , do n't we ?

oh - i 'll get it !

i - i guess they tried to , but they bent their stingers .

ohh -- what 's that ? oh --

oh --

oh , goodness ! how did you ever get like this ?

... oh , did that hurt ?

... m ... m ... my , my , my , my goodness -- i can talk again ! oh -- oil my arms , please -- oil my elbows .

my mouth -- my mouth !

oh -- oh -- they 're all wonderful .

they 're coming back !

as monarch of the forest i do n't like the situation .

no , but it 's wonderful for threatening with .

does it work ?

ohh !

oh , but -- but please . it 's very important .

a home --

well , your head ai n't made of straw , you know .

now lookit , dorothy , you ai n't using your head about miss gulch . think you did n't have any brains at all .

-- a hot water bottle would be good if we had one .

... along .

i do n't see why not . why do n't you come along with us ? we 're on our way to see the wizard now . to get him a heart .

oh , that 's too bad . do n't you think the wizard could help him , too ?

do -- do you suppose we 'll meet any wild animals ?

i do n't like this forest ! it 's -- it 's dark and creepy !

... just that the witch is so wicked . i do n't think you two ought to come with me because you 'll get into trouble .

oil can ? oh -- oh , here it is !

what ?

come along , dorothy -- you do n't want any of those apples . hmm !

hooray ! we 're off to see a wizard !

do you think if i went with you this wizard would give me some brains ?

that 's where i live . and i want to get back there so badly i 'm going all the way to emerald city to get the wizard of oz to help me .

um-hmm .

it 's pleasant down that way , too .

very well -- i 'll bide my time -- and as for you , my fine lady , it 's true , i ca n't attend to you here and now as i 'd like , but just try to stay out of my way ... .

you stay out of this , glinda , or i 'll fix you as well !

the ruby slippers ! what have you done with them ? give them back to me , or i 'll -- -

leave her alone !

who killed my sister ? who killed the witch of the east ? was it you ? answer me !

yeah .

you humbug !

this way ! come on !

where -- where do we go now ?

and you 're going to lead us .

what happened ?

who at ?

would ... would it do any good if i roared ?

i hope your tail holds out . oh --

there . now , that 's the best we can do without any pins .

oh , poor dorothy . we may never see her again .

now , let ' s see -- this goes -- oh , i wish i were better at puzzles .

it 's a whatzis ?

dorothy ! you ca n't sleep here ! you ca n't sleep in the middle of a field !

no !

you mean she bit you ?

dorothy ? well , what has dorothy done ?

howdy , miss gulch .

mr. gale !

quiet !

yes -- how about dorothy ?

you put up a great fight , lion .

do n't cry now . we have n't got the oil-can with us and you 've been squeaking enough as it is .

oh ! well , what happened to you ?

it 's a whozis ?

i can fairly hear my heart beating !

here , tin man -- help me .

oh ! we ought to try and carry dorothy .

do n't cry -- you 'll rust yourself again !

a heart --

we do .

no , sir !

i 'll see you reach the wizard , whether i get a heart of not . bee-hive -- bah ! let her try and make a bee-hive out of me ! you know -- hmm ? what 's that ?

well , you ca n't . as for you , my fine friend -- you 're a victim of disorganized thinking . you are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger , you have no courage . you 're confusing courage with wisdom . back where i come from , we have men who are called heroes . once a year , they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city . and they have no more courage than you have . but ! they have one thing that you have n't got ! a medal ! therefore -- for meritorious ... .

how can i ever thank you enough ?

you promised us real things -- a real ...

-- and the courage that you promised cowardly lion ?

well , i --

what about the heart that you promised tin man -- ?

oh ! help me ! the balloon 's going up !

but i still want one .

so isnt it time you unwrapped your present ?

but what if ...

hes sealed himself in .

is there another way ?

what the hell are you talking about ?

what the hell were you doing ? you nearly killed us !

its a bomb alright . were still dead if the trigger charge goes off ...

then its no longer a bomb ?

alright then , brunch .

when this is over we should bury the hatchet . celebrate . a champagne dinner ?

heres your imposter . hes paid off the men on the plane outside . theyre not taking the bomb to any russian facility , theyre flying it wherever he tells them .

doctor . jones . christmas jones . no jokes , ive heard them all .

you new ?

... yes ? ...

then maybe id be ... open to that .

dislocated collar bone . if any more tendons snap ... it wont just be two weeks out of action .

now robert is dead . he got his revenge .

the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata , killing off his sense of touch . he feels no pain . he can push himself harder , longer than any normal man .

sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist ?

who ?

its barely a scratch . the dome broke my fall .

ive scheduled a medical for you .

quite the opposite , in fact .

i cant tell you ... alright , alright ! but you must protect me !

stripped of all your weaponry , you still threaten me ?

your last chance . take the money .

who did you get it from ?

you will never touch her . you will never get near her .

indeed .

today , of all days , the sun decides to shine .

one ... last ... screw ?

it is my oil ! mine and my familys !

was this all about the oil ?

you turned renard .

since i was a child , ive always had a power over men . when i realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers , i knew i had to form a new alliance .

not interested .

i could have given you the world .

im coming with you .

we had a run-in , he and i. he knew about us , he knew about my shoulder , he knew exactly where to hurt me ...

whats wrong with you ? are you crazy ?

i used my body on the guards . it gave me control . i got to a gun and i took my chance . ive never told anyone that .

you had your chance , james . now im looking for a bigger thrill .

vodka martini .

james ...

its the only way out ...

youre not going to .

i cant stay here .

you dont take no for an answer , do you ?

if youve come here to look after me , mr. bond , thank you , but no thank you . i have two bodyguards , i dont need a third ...

how long has he been with you ?

partially , yes .

is that why you want to finish the pipeline ?

funerals arent exactly memorable .

i met you at my fathers funeral .

the maidens tower .

the right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the bosphorus , cut off the black sea .

a special job . a ... a ... a submarine .

now ... where were we ?

i thought you were the one in her business .

shes no innocent . this is my nuclear consultant .

but you would have something to gain by killing robert king . and stopping his pipeline .

bond . if someone wants you dead , it is renard . our government has nothing to gain by killing you .

that too . everyone does what they can to survive .

see ? youre upsetting my customers . what do you want ?

valentin zukovsky .

your father ...

please .

this is the end .

he was a ... good lover ?

is it ?

warm .

and expensive . cost three million plus .

they want in . seems our friend here was hardcore ctu .

you oughta see upstairs . it 's a slaughterhouse .

saw the world that night -- random , empty , hideous . god did n't make it that way . we did . we make the world -- in our own image . what else can i illuminate ?

that man , then , he was the first . the first you --

god is n't there to do it .

why , doctor . i did . he was a bad dog .

walter --

what are you doing , veidt ?

we 've lost a colleague . the comedian is dead .

the bearer of bad news .

jon -- for gods sake , what do you see ?

jon --

cured , yes .

i explained this . i ca n't . that 's not the way it happens .

because you ca n't , i know , it 's preordained . so sorry . i forgot . jon . this , this `` script '' you 're following . . . who writes it ?

always . ever since the day i died .

memories of the future are just like any others . i 've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . . you wo n't die of cancer , laurie . there wo n't be time for that .

i did n't give you cancer , laurie . not you , not the others . i do n't know what did .

yet you must 've known all along that you 'd give me cancer . just be being with me .

yes , i loved you . i left the earth when i lost you .

the atmosphere . i 'm sorry . these things slip my mind .

in the immediate future we 're on mars . i 'm telling you goodbye . you 're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .

i 'm not here . i 'm still on mars . i 've come to collect you .

i could stay and go .

mm hmm .

i 'm here , laurie .

yes . i heard this morning . washington 's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol .

you ruthless son of a bitch . you really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world ?

im not .

what ? ?

yeah . see , i 've been working on a little project . top secret , of course . . .

good . be careful , daniel , do n't let up your guard . look , i 'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at karnak until all this blows over . you two would be welcome to join me .

if he comes here , i 'll handle him . remember -- i 've always protected you . have n't i ? do you need money ?

the comedian . he 's dead . murdered . that 's all i know .

dan , is this -- is this new york ? ?

welcome back , night owl .

i think he 's going to the john .

what 's he doing ?

that detroit shit ? i 'm so worried .

what the hell -- ?

dan ! the spare costumes ! i ca n't believe you kept them .

would you want to sit out a war ? i mean -- what would be left .

adrian 's headed down to his secret retreat . he invited us to come along . i 've been thinking . if things do get nasty . . . it would n't be a bad place to sit out a war .

antarctica ? ?

i know what you 're thinking . you 'd be a lot safer if i were n't around .

one more down . someone tried to kill adrian . . . . first time i 've ever heard him scared .

are you kidding ? if they put him in jail he 's dead . he 'll never get to trial .

. . . what ?

i 'd say you stalled out about forty years ago . nellie lutcher -- louis jordan -- i 've never even heard of these people .

i 'm gon na take a warm bath and sack out . -- you 've been really sweet . sleep tight , okay ?

no , screw that . what you were saying before , it 's absolutely right . -- i 'd love to have you stay .

laurie , wait . i 've got a spare room . it 's empty . if you 'd like . . . laurie oh daniel , thanks , but i could n't . you 'd just be all nervous about --

that 's the one . whatever happened to him ?

well , that was adrian 's idea . i know he 's the smartest man in the world and all that , but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .



fine , but the civil terrorism unit ? it 's a fucking gestapo ! dirty tricks -- political assassinations --

adrian -- you ? you killed blake , and --

coward . giving up .

come on , rorschach . gim me a break --

how do we know they 've got cancer ? could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .

. . . that was quick .

i can fix it .

stupid watch . stopped again . do you have the --

nothing . what were you going to say ?

we should get back -- what ?

is n't it true that you --

no . we laid out very careful ground rules --

six to eight months . that 's with treatment . -- perhaps now you can see why it 's so vital that we locate your . . . friends .

what does this mean ? what does it --

what are you saying ? that jon is radioactive ?

you 're lying , miss juspeczyk .

stay , adrian . i just -- every once in a while , i need to talk to someone human . he does n't think like we do . he does n't even feel what we feel . i mean -- he even scares the research teams .

adrian ! do n't leave so soon . i --

ctu ? jesus . you do n't think --

before you do that , you might want to look at what i 've been looking at .

no . i just hastened the inevitable . he 's been ready to blow for years . i knew all it would take was a little push . so i , uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer .

new information .

cut the crap , x , i saw you down there . you 're a hero . do n't be afraid to join the good guys .

we do n't have that kinda time , boss , i do n't think prague 's gon na be around much longer . i 've got ta go now . i 've got a lot of bad guys to kill .

kinda funny , though , is n't it ? we 're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway . guess we shoulda played by the rules .

yeah , that 's right . so now that you know , you understand why it 's important that we get it back .

you ai n't seen nothing yet .

crude and defiant as always , triple x. it fits so well because you 're obscene .

up yours .

i expect you to call in regularly with progress reports .

not bad for a gimp .

that 's too bad . i thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge .

i plan on getting a lot older . and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead .

you 've really got me confused , cage . on the one hand you showed leadership , courage under fire , a willingness to protect men you hardly knew ... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic . help me out here . i 'm not following your evolution .

you 've got this wrong . you 're not under arrest , you 've been abducted . and until i say different , you belong to me .

it 's your lucky day . you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy .

good for you . now why do n't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want . you did n't go through all this for my benefit .

looks like a diner .

what is this place ?

you 're talking about a very expensive risk here .

i think we should send him whatever he wants .

i 've seen enough . turn it off .

but programmable . and expendable .

the scum of the earth .

we 're gon na have to step in , sam . those cia boys could n't find a clown in a field of cactus . let me take care of it .

we 're on to the game , ese . you got the fake blood splattered all over the walls , you got your torture tools ... it 's all very cute . but come on , let 's quit while you 're ahead . i 'm only trying to save you a beatin ' .

we seen this kind of parachutes before , you know . u.s. army . you got some friends here , jump out with you guys ?

that 's some accident , hombre . you accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard .

oh , i do n't know . it was an accident .

nothing , really . my guy is just doing it to stay alive .

by then it 's too late ! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water ! the chemicals will break down and dissipate !

you okay ?

when this is over , we 're just gon na take off , the two of us . take a vacation .

you do n't have to do that .

no , now it 's about us . let 's do something for us before we both get killed . do n't you want to get to bora bora , xander ?

of course it matters . hey , hold on !

wait a minute , whoa . we ca n't go now . what 's yorgi got planned with that nerve agent ?

i know which cops are good and which are bad . come with me . come on , right now .

i do n't know what 's going on anymore . i thought i was square with that dude . now everybody 's switching sides like it 's the wwf .

i 'm busted up for you , but jesus , what the hell are you doing ? those people almost drowned on that boat and you did n't lift a finger .

i do n't know . eight months ago i stop hearing from my people . no explanation , just silence . so i stay and i wait like i was told . soon i 'm in so far , they 'd kill me if i left . now every day i get farther and farther away from what i was . i 'm like you said , a criminal .

you 're what ? what the hell have you been doing ?

no , something worse . he says it 's a surprise , but i know him . this is his masterpiece .

so what 's the plan with this ahab ? are they selling it or what ?

they 'll kill you , you know they will . besides , there is no back door . keep smiling . ready ? now .

they tell me you 're an american agent .

so there you have it . i guess you just have to ask yourself , how bad to you want out ?

so why do n't you tell me something about who you gather information for . they obviously have very deep pockets . are you from a rival clan ?

i 'm from l.a .

i 'm an information gatherer . you wan na go somewhere and talk about it ?

look at you . you 're helping run things now . you 're a gangster . i bet that snuck up on you . you woke up one day and you were a criminal .

go to hell !

i do n't know what you 're talking about .

bullshit . i see you look at everything , study everything , ask questions . i know exactly what you 're doing . empty your pockets .

do n't even bother , x man , i 'm not your type .

sure . just chisel some off your heart .

is she for real ? honey , maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation .

nothing . he had two days .

think again , that 's government property . you have to sign for everything . i 've got one more that was n't on your list .

you 're wrong about that . i 'm heading out that door right now .

i was gon na wait till the islands , but ...

it 's not about the money , x ! you never plan for anything . i ca n't live like that anymore , i need some stability .

i 'm having fun , what 's the problem ?

you run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert , you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs , all with no health insurance ... it 's insane , i ca n't take it anymore .

i can see that . why ?

hey , you do n't need all this just to go on vacation . unless this ai n't for going on vacation ...

you killed me , remember ? now i have to hide out here with you . where have you been ?

sit down .

they 're all over the place ! what the hell 's going on ?

been to any good diners lately ?

what 's so damn funny ?

not bad , man , not bad . you put things together quick . prague it is .

you , an army brat ? i do n't see that one at all . did you join the service as well ?

to us it means no walls , no speed limits , no jails . it 's everybody does what he wants . people think democracy is freedom but they do n't have a clue . there 's an old punk song . it says : `` america stands for freedom , but if you think you 're free ... ''

it 's all this craziness ! it 's what we 've been living since 99 , when we left the army . one of our brothers died in grozny and we said the hell with this shit . what for ? he dies for what ? politics ? who 's politics ? not ours .

when else are you gon na do it ?

i appreciate you bringing this to our attention . whatever you want , the rest of the night , consider it on the house .

we all do .

its core ?

into the hudson ?

no . i 'm ... i do n't know if we can do this without charles .

what 's wrong with him ?

what are you talking about ?

i 've served with men like you before . methodical . systematic -- naive . you know what happens to those men in a real fight ?

how long have you been in alaska ?

inspiring -- now what am i doing here ?

yeah , i 'll bet you have .

logan , do you see this ring ?

he takes his work seriously .

what if i like the pain ?

i 'll see what i can do -- you should get some sleep . even with your healing ability , you 're going to be hurting for a while .

tell it to the ones that did this to me .

senator ?

i can assure you , there is no such creature in my genes .

this was taken by a state police officer in secaucus , new jersey . a man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him . i do n't know where you come from , ms. grey , but where i come from , you do n't go melting people 's cars when they cut you off . you do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger . but what you presume to tell this committee -

you would n't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --

you 're avoiding the question i posed to you at the beginning of the hearing , ms. grey . three words : are mutants dangerous ?

what is it you intend to do to me ?

you mutant bastards ...

you ... wha ... who are you ... where is henry ?

what are you going to do ?

he helped you ?

actually , magneto helped me put it together .

to find rogue .

what if it never happens ? what if they 're so afraid of us that we become the enemy ? -- this place is gon na be one giant cemetery .

what am i doing here ?

if she held on any longer she could have .

what did she do to me ?

a piece . only a piece .

it does indeed , max .

this checkmate goes to you . i did n't want to hurt anyone . but you leave me no choice .

is that so ?

no !

you have the wrong house .

where did you get this cauliflower ?

i have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed ... and by god , it shall be done !

i did , sir .

love me oodles and oodles ?

did you see ? ... i put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts . the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies .

well ... yes .

darling !

yes . i am a bit tired , after all .

love you ! ... well , why do n't we turn in ?

love me ?

darling !

goodbye , darling !

goodbye , darling .

oh , nice .

mother 's going to help me with the invitations .

will you miss me ?

oh , darling -- so will i .

i put her in the guest room , just down the hall .

well ... we 'll see .

this is the only library i know of .

well , there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will . these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study .

i see . and where is my grandfather 's private library ?

may i have it , please ?

yes ! ... the laboratory .

all right then , i suppose i owe the family that much . you 'll have everything ready for me when i arrive ?

i did n't do that .

oh , at least , sir . the land alone is worth a small fortune .

my name is gerhart falkstein .

fron kon steen !

nineteen , sir .

yes , but , sir ... if it could be accomplished , would n't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death ?

but was n't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work , sir ... ? the re-animation of component parts ?

but are n't you the grandson of the famous dr. victor frankenstein ? ... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism ?

oh ! i thought it was dr. frankenstein .

okay , boss ! but i hope you know what you 're doing .

yes , master . are you sure you want to go through with it ?

there 's only one way .

what ? ? ?

you do n't understand , master . the big fellow 's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee .
